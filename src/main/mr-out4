BIRD 1
A 1
certain 1
king 1
had 1
a 1
beautiful 1
garden 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
stood 1
a 1
tree 1
which 1
bore 1
golden 1
apples 1
These 1
apples 1
were 1
always 1
counted 1
and 1
about 1
the 1
time 1
when 1
they 1
began 1
to 1
grow 1
ripe 1
it 1
was 1
found 1
that 1
every 1
night 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
was 1
gone 1
The 1
king 1
became 1
very 1
angry 1
at 1
this 1
and 1
ordered 1
the 1
gardener 1
to 1
keep 1
watch 1
all 1
night 1
under 1
the 1
tree 1
The 1
gardener 1
set 1
his 1
eldest 1
son 1
to 1
watch 1
but 1
about 1
twelve 1
o 1
clock 1
he 1
fell 1
asleep 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
another 1
of 1
the 1
apples 1
was 1
missing 1
Then 1
the 1
second 1
son 1
was 1
ordered 1
to 1
watch 1
and 1
at 1
midnight 1
he 1
too 1
fell 1
asleep 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
another 1
apple 1
was 1
gone 1
Then 1
the 1
third 1
son 1
offered 1
to 1
keep 1
watch 1
but 1
the 1
gardener 1
at 1
first 1
would 1
not 1
let 1
him 1
for 1
fear 1
some 1
harm 1
should 1
come 1
to 1
him 1
however 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
consented 1
and 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
laid 1
himself 1
under 1
the 1
tree 1
to 1
watch 1
As 1
the 1
clock 1
struck 1
twelve 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
rustling 1
noise 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
a 1
bird 1
came 1
flying 1
that 1
was 1
of 1
pure 1
gold 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
snapping 1
at 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
apples 1
with 1
its 1
beak 1
the 1
gardener 1
s 1
son 1
jumped 1
up 1
and 1
shot 1
an 1
arrow 1
at 1
it 1
But 1
the 1
arrow 1
did 1
the 1
bird 1
no 1
harm 1
only 1
it 1
dropped 1
a 1
golden 1
feather 1
from 1
its 1
tail 1
and 1
then 1
flew 1
away 1
The 1
golden 1
feather 1
was 1
brought 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
council 1
was 1
called 1
together 1
Everyone 1
agreed 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
worth 1
more 1
than 1
all 1
the 1
wealth 1
of 1
the 1
kingdom 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
said 1
One 1
feather 1
is 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
must 1
have 1
the 1
whole 1
bird 1
Then 1
the 1
gardener 1
s 1
eldest 1
son 1
set 1
out 1
and 1
thought 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
golden 1
bird 1
very 1
easily 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
but 1
a 1
little 1
way 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
wood 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
fox 1
sitting 1
so 1
he 1
took 1
his 1
bow 1
and 1
made 1
ready 1
to 1
shoot 1
at 1
it 1
Then 1
the 1
fox 1
said 1
Do 1
not 1
shoot 1
me 1
for 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
good 1
counsel 1
I 1
know 1
what 1
your 1
business 1
is 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
golden 1
bird 1
You 1
will 1
reach 1
a 1
village 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
and 1
when 1
you 1
get 1
there 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
two 1
inns 1
opposite 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
one 1
of 1
which 1
is 1
very 1
pleasant 1
and 1
beautiful 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
go 1
not 1
in 1
there 1
but 1
rest 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
though 1
it 1
may 1
appear 1
to 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
very 1
poor 1
and 1
mean 1
But 1
the 1
son 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
What 1
can 1
such 1
a 1
beast 1
as 1
this 1
know 1
about 1
the 1
matter 1
So 1
he 1
shot 1
his 1
arrow 1
at 1
the 1
fox 1
but 1
he 1
missed 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
set 1
up 1
its 1
tail 1
above 1
its 1
back 1
and 1
ran 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
Then 1
he 1
went 1
his 1
way 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
where 1
the 1
two 1
inns 1
were 1
and 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
were 1
people 1
singing 1
and 1
dancing 1
and 1
feasting 1
but 1
the 1
other 1
looked 1
very 1
dirty 1
and 1
poor 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
very 1
silly 1
said 1
he 1
if 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
that 1
shabby 1
house 1
and 1
left 1
this 1
charming 1
place 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
smart 1
house 1
and 1
ate 1
and 1
drank 1
at 1
his 1
ease 1
and 1
forgot 1
the 1
bird 1
and 1
his 1
country 1
too 1
Time 1
passed 1
on 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
eldest 1
son 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
no 1
tidings 1
were 1
heard 1
of 1
him 1
the 1
second 1
son 1
set 1
out 1
and 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
happened 1
to 1
him 1
He 1
met 1
the 1
fox 1
who 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
good 1
advice 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
two 1
inns 1
his 1
eldest 1
brother 1
was 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
where 1
the 1
merrymaking 1
was 1
and 1
called 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
come 1
in 1
and 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
withstand 1
the 1
temptation 1
but 1
went 1
in 1
and 1
forgot 1
the 1
golden 1
bird 1
and 1
his 1
country 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
manner 1
Time 1
passed 1
on 1
again 1
and 1
the 1
youngest 1
son 1
too 1
wished 1
to 1
set 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
wide 1
world 1
to 1
seek 1
for 1
the 1
golden 1
bird 1
but 1
his 1
father 1
would 1
not 1
listen 1
to 1
it 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
while 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
his 1
son 1
and 1
was 1
afraid 1
that 1
some 1
ill 1
luck 1
might 1
happen 1
to 1
him 1
also 1
and 1
prevent 1
his 1
coming 1
back 1
However 1
at 1
last 1
it 1
was 1
agreed 1
he 1
should 1
go 1
for 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
rest 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
wood 1
he 1
met 1
the 1
fox 1
and 1
heard 1
the 1
same 1
good 1
counsel 1
But 1
he 1
was 1
thankful 1
to 1
the 1
fox 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
attempt 1
his 1
life 1
as 1
his 1
brothers 1
had 1
done 1
so 1
the 1
fox 1
said 1
Sit 1
upon 1
my 1
tail 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
travel 1
faster 1
So 1
he 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
the 1
fox 1
began 1
to 1
run 1
and 1
away 1
they 1
went 1
over 1
stock 1
and 1
stone 1
so 1
quick 1
that 1
their 1
hair 1
whistled 1
in 1
the 1
wind 1
When 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
the 1
son 1
followed 1
the 1
fox 1
s 1
counsel 1
and 1
without 1
looking 1
about 1
him 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
shabby 1
inn 1
and 1
rested 1
there 1
all 1
night 1
at 1
his 1
ease 1
In 1
the 1
morning 1
came 1
the 1
fox 1
again 1
and 1
met 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
beginning 1
his 1
journey 1
and 1
said 1
Go 1
straight 1
forward 1
till 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
castle 1
before 1
which 1
lie 1
a 1
whole 1
troop 1
of 1
soldiers 1
fast 1
asleep 1
and 1
snoring 1
take 1
no 1
notice 1
of 1
them 1
but 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
castle 1
and 1
pass 1
on 1
and 1
on 1
till 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
room 1
where 1
the 1
golden 1
bird 1
sits 1
in 1
a 1
wooden 1
cage 1
close 1
by 1
it 1
stands 1
a 1
beautiful 1
golden 1
cage 1
but 1
do 1
not 1
try 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
bird 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
shabby 1
cage 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
handsome 1
one 1
otherwise 1
you 1
will 1
repent 1
it 1
Then 1
the 1
fox 1
stretched 1
out 1
his 1
tail 1
again 1
and 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
sat 1
himself 1
down 1
and 1
away 1
they 1
went 1
over 1
stock 1
and 1
stone 1
till 1
their 1
hair 1
whistled 1
in 1
the 1
wind 1
Before 1
the 1
castle 1
gate 1
all 1
was 1
as 1
the 1
fox 1
had 1
said 1
so 1
the 1
son 1
went 1
in 1
and 1
found 1
the 1
chamber 1
where 1
the 1
golden 1
bird 1
hung 1
in 1
a 1
wooden 1
cage 1
and 1
below 1
stood 1
the 1
golden 1
cage 1
and 1
the 1
three 1
golden 1
apples 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
lost 1
were 1
lying 1
close 1
by 1
it 1
Then 1
thought 1
he 1
to 1
himself 1
It 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
very 1
droll 1
thing 1
to 1
bring 1
away 1
such 1
a 1
fine 1
bird 1
in 1
this 1
shabby 1
cage 1
so 1
he 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
took 1
hold 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
golden 1
cage 1
But 1
the 1
bird 1
set 1
up 1
such 1
a 1
loud 1
scream 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
soldiers 1
awoke 1
and 1
they 1
took 1
him 1
prisoner 1
and 1
carried 1
him 1
before 1
the 1
king 1
The 1
next 1
morning 1
the 1
court 1
sat 1
to 1
judge 1
him 1
and 1
when 1
all 1
was 1
heard 1
it 1
sentenced 1
him 1
to 1
die 1
unless 1
he 1
should 1
bring 1
the 1
king 1
the 1
golden 1
horse 1
which 1
could 1
run 1
as 1
swiftly 1
as 1
the 1
wind 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
this 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
golden 1
bird 1
given 1
him 1
for 1
his 1
own 1
So 1
he 1
set 1
out 1
once 1
more 1
on 1
his 1
journey 1
sighing 1
and 1
in 1
great 1
despair 1
when 1
on 1
a 1
sudden 1
his 1
friend 1
the 1
fox 1
met 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
You 1
see 1
now 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
your 1
not 1
listening 1
to 1
my 1
counsel 1
I 1
will 1
still 1
however 1
tell 1
you 1
how 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
golden 1
horse 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
do 1
as 1
I 1
bid 1
you 1
You 1
must 1
go 1
straight 1
on 1
till 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
castle 1
where 1
the 1
horse 1
stands 1
in 1
his 1
stall 1
by 1
his 1
side 1
will 1
lie 1
the 1
groom 1
fast 1
asleep 1
and 1
snoring 1
take 1
away 1
the 1
horse 1
quietly 1
but 1
be 1
sure 1
to 1
put 1
the 1
old 1
leathern 1
saddle 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
not 1
the 1
golden 1
one 1
that 1
is 1
close 1
by 1
it 1
Then 1
the 1
son 1
sat 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
fox 1
s 1
tail 1
and 1
away 1
they 1
went 1
over 1
stock 1
and 1
stone 1
till 1
their 1
hair 1
whistled 1
in 1
the 1
wind 1
All 1
went 1
right 1
and 1
the 1
groom 1
lay 1
snoring 1
with 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
the 1
golden 1
saddle 1
But 1
when 1
the 1
son 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
horse 1
he 1
thought 1
it 1
a 1
great 1
pity 1
to 1
put 1
the 1
leathern 1
saddle 1
upon 1
it 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
him 1
the 1
good 1
one 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
he 1
deserves 1
it 1
As 1
he 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
golden 1
saddle 1
the 1
groom 1
awoke 1
and 1
cried 1
out 1
so 1
loud 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
guards 1
ran 1
in 1
and 1
took 1
him 1
prisoner 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
he 1
was 1
again 1
brought 1
before 1
the 1
court 1
to 1
be 1
judged 1
and 1
was 1
sentenced 1
to 1
die 1
But 1
it 1
was 1
agreed 1
that 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
bring 1
thither 1
the 1
beautiful 1
princess 1
he 1
should 1
live 1
and 1
have 1
the 1
bird 1
and 1
the 1
horse 1
given 1
him 1
for 1
his 1
own 1
Then 1
he 1
went 1
his 1
way 1
very 1
sorrowful 1
but 1
the 1
old 1
fox 1
came 1
and 1
said 1
Why 1
did 1
not 1
you 1
listen 1
to 1
me 1
If 1
you 1
had 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
carried 1
away 1
both 1
the 1
bird 1
and 1
the 1
horse 1
yet 1
will 1
I 1
once 1
more 1
give 1
you 1
counsel 1
Go 1
straight 1
on 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
you 1
will 1
arrive 1
at 1
a 1
castle 1
At 1
twelve 1
o 1
clock 1
at 1
night 1
the 1
princess 1
goes 1
to 1
the 1
bathing 1
house 1
go 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
give 1
her 1
a 1
kiss 1
and 1
she 1
will 1
let 1
you 1
lead 1
her 1
away 1
but 1
take 1
care 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
suffer 1
her 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
take 1
leave 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
Then 1
the 1
fox 1
stretched 1
out 1
his 1
tail 1
and 1
so 1
away 1
they 1
went 1
over 1
stock 1
and 1
stone 1
till 1
their 1
hair 1
whistled 1
again 1
As 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
castle 1
all 1
was 1
as 1
the 1
fox 1
had 1
said 1
and 1
at 1
twelve 1
o 1
clock 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
met 1
the 1
princess 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
bath 1
and 1
gave 1
her 1
the 1
kiss 1
and 1
she 1
agreed 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
with 1
him 1
but 1
begged 1
with 1
many 1
tears 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
let 1
her 1
take 1
leave 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
At 1
first 1
he 1
refused 1
but 1
she 1
wept 1
still 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
and 1
fell 1
at 1
his 1
feet 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
consented 1
but 1
the 1
moment 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
her 1
father 1
s 1
house 1
the 1
guards 1
awoke 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
taken 1
prisoner 1
again 1
Then 1
he 1
was 1
brought 1
before 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
said 1
You 1
shall 1
never 1
have 1
my 1
daughter 1
unless 1
in 1
eight 1
days 1
you 1
dig 1
away 1
the 1
hill 1
that 1
stops 1
the 1
view 1
from 1
my 1
window 1
Now 1
this 1
hill 1
was 1
so 1
big 1
that 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
could 1
not 1
take 1
it 1
away 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
worked 1
for 1
seven 1
days 1
and 1
had 1
done 1
very 1
little 1
the 1
fox 1
came 1
and 1
said 1
Lie 1
down 1
and 1
go 1
to 1
sleep 1
I 1
will 1
work 1
for 1
you 1
And 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
he 1
awoke 1
and 1
the 1
hill 1
was 1
gone 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
merrily 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
now 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
removed 1
he 1
must 1
give 1
him 1
the 1
princess 1
Then 1
the 1
king 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
keep 1
his 1
word 1
and 1
away 1
went 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
and 1
the 1
fox 1
came 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
We 1
will 1
have 1
all 1
three 1
the 1
princess 1
the 1
horse 1
and 1
the 1
bird 1
Ah 1
said 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
great 1
thing 1
but 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
contrive 1
it 1
If 1
you 1
will 1
only 1
listen 1
said 1
the 1
fox 1
it 1
can 1
be 1
done 1
When 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
he 1
asks 1
for 1
the 1
beautiful 1
princess 1
you 1
must 1
say 1
Here 1
she 1
is 1
Then 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
very 1
joyful 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
mount 1
the 1
golden 1
horse 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
to 1
give 1
you 1
and 1
put 1
out 1
your 1
hand 1
to 1
take 1
leave 1
of 1
them 1
but 1
shake 1
hands 1
with 1
the 1
princess 1
last 1
Then 1
lift 1
her 1
quickly 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
horse 1
behind 1
you 1
clap 1
your 1
spurs 1
to 1
his 1
side 1
and 1
gallop 1
away 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
All 1
went 1
right 1
then 1
the 1
fox 1
said 1
When 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
castle 1
where 1
the 1
bird 1
is 1
I 1
will 1
stay 1
with 1
the 1
princess 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
ride 1
in 1
and 1
speak 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
sees 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
right 1
horse 1
he 1
will 1
bring 1
out 1
the 1
bird 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
sit 1
still 1
and 1
say 1
that 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
to 1
see 1
whether 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
true 1
golden 1
bird 1
and 1
when 1
you 1
get 1
it 1
into 1
your 1
hand 1
ride 1
away 1
This 1
too 1
happened 1
as 1
the 1
fox 1
said 1
they 1
carried 1
off 1
the 1
bird 1
the 1
princess 1
mounted 1
again 1
and 1
they 1
rode 1
on 1
to 1
a 1
great 1
wood 1
Then 1
the 1
fox 1
came 1
and 1
said 1
Pray 1
kill 1
me 1
and 1
cut 1
off 1
my 1
head 1
and 1
my 1
feet 1
But 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
refused 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
so 1
the 1
fox 1
said 1
I 1
will 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
give 1
you 1
good 1
counsel 1
beware 1
of 1
two 1
things 1
ransom 1
no 1
one 1
from 1
the 1
gallows 1
and 1
sit 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
no 1
river 1
Then 1
away 1
he 1
went 1
Well 1
thought 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
hard 1
matter 1
to 1
keep 1
that 1
advice 1
He 1
rode 1
on 1
with 1
the 1
princess 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
his 1
two 1
brothers 1
And 1
there 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
great 1
noise 1
and 1
uproar 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
asked 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
matter 1
the 1
people 1
said 1
Two 1
men 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
hanged 1
As 1
he 1
came 1
nearer 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
two 1
men 1
were 1
his 1
brothers 1
who 1
had 1
turned 1
robbers 1
so 1
he 1
said 1
Cannot 1
they 1
in 1
any 1
way 1
be 1
saved 1
But 1
the 1
people 1
said 1
No 1
unless 1
he 1
would 1
bestow 1
all 1
his 1
money 1
upon 1
the 1
rascals 1
and 1
buy 1
their 1
liberty 1
Then 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
stay 1
to 1
think 1
about 1
the 1
matter 1
but 1
paid 1
what 1
was 1
asked 1
and 1
his 1
brothers 1
were 1
given 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
with 1
him 1
towards 1
their 1
home 1
And 1
as 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
wood 1
where 1
the 1
fox 1
first 1
met 1
them 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
cool 1
and 1
pleasant 1
that 1
the 1
two 1
brothers 1
said 1
Let 1
us 1
sit 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
rest 1
a 1
while 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
drink 1
So 1
he 1
said 1
Yes 1
and 1
forgot 1
the 1
fox 1
s 1
counsel 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
while 1
he 1
suspected 1
nothing 1
they 1
came 1
behind 1
and 1
threw 1
him 1
down 1
the 1
bank 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
princess 1
the 1
horse 1
and 1
the 1
bird 1
and 1
went 1
home 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
their 1
master 1
and 1
said 1
All 1
this 1
have 1
we 1
won 1
by 1
our 1
labour 1
Then 1
there 1
was 1
great 1
rejoicing 1
made 1
but 1
the 1
horse 1
would 1
not 1
eat 1
the 1
bird 1
would 1
not 1
sing 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
wept 1
The 1
youngest 1
son 1
fell 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
s 1
bed 1
luckily 1
it 1
was 1
nearly 1
dry 1
but 1
his 1
bones 1
were 1
almost 1
broken 1
and 1
the 1
bank 1
was 1
so 1
steep 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
find 1
no 1
way 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
Then 1
the 1
old 1
fox 1
came 1
once 1
more 1
and 1
scolded 1
him 1
for 1
not 1
following 1
his 1
advice 1
otherwise 1
no 1
evil 1
would 1
have 1
befallen 1
him 1
Yet 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
cannot 1
leave 1
you 1
here 1
so 1
lay 1
hold 1
of 1
my 1
tail 1
and 1
hold 1
fast 1
Then 1
he 1
pulled 1
him 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
got 1
upon 1
the 1
bank 1
Your 1
brothers 1
have 1
set 1
watch 1
to 1
kill 1
you 1
if 1
they 1
find 1
you 1
in 1
the 1
kingdom 1
So 1
he 1
dressed 1
himself 1
as 1
a 1
poor 1
man 1
and 1
came 1
secretly 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
court 1
and 1
was 1
scarcely 1
within 1
the 1
doors 1
when 1
the 1
horse 1
began 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
the 1
bird 1
to 1
sing 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
left 1
off 1
weeping 1
Then 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
all 1
his 1
brothers 1
roguery 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
seized 1
and 1
punished 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
princess 1
given 1
to 1
him 1
again 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
death 1
he 1
was 1
heir 1
to 1
his 1
kingdom 1
A 1
long 1
while 1
after 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
walk 1
one 1
day 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
fox 1
met 1
him 1
and 1
besought 1
him 1
with 1
tears 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
to 1
kill 1
him 1
and 1
cut 1
off 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
feet 1
And 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
did 1
so 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
the 1
fox 1
was 1
changed 1
into 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
turned 1
out 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
brother 1
of 1
the 1
princess 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
lost 1
a 1
great 1
many 2
years 1
HANS 1
IN 1
LUCK 1
Some 1
men 1
are 1
born 1
to 1
good 1
luck 1
all 1
they 1
do 1
or 1
try 1
to 1
do 1
comes 1
right 1
all 1
that 1
falls 1
to 1
them 1
is 1
so 1
much 1
gain 1
all 1
their 1
geese 1
are 1
swans 1
all 1
their 1
cards 1
are 1
trumps 1
toss 1
them 1
which 1
way 1
you 1
will 1
they 1
will 1
always 1
like 1
poor 1
puss 1
alight 1
upon 1
their 1
legs 1
and 1
only 1
move 1
on 1
so 1
much 1
the 1
faster 1
The 1
world 1
may 1
very 1
likely 1
not 1
always 1
think 1
of 1
them 1
as 1
they 1
think 1
of 1
themselves 1
but 1
what 1
care 1
they 1
for 1
the 1
world 1
what 1
can 1
it 1
know 1
about 1
the 1
matter 1
One 1
of 1
these 1
lucky 1
beings 1
was 1
neighbour 1
Hans 1
Seven 1
long 1
years 1
he 1
had 1
worked 1
hard 1
for 1
his 1
master 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
said 1
Master 1
my 1
time 1
is 1
up 1
I 1
must 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
see 1
my 1
poor 1
mother 1
once 1
more 1
so 1
pray 1
pay 1
me 1
my 1
wages 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
And 1
the 1
master 1
said 1
You 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
faithful 1
and 1
good 1
servant 1
Hans 1
so 1
your 1
pay 1
shall 1
be 1
handsome 1
Then 1
he 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
lump 1
of 1
silver 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
his 1
head 1
Hans 1
took 1
out 1
his 1
pocket 1
handkerchief 1
put 1
the 1
piece 1
of 1
silver 1
into 1
it 1
threw 1
it 1
over 1
his 1
shoulder 1
and 1
jogged 1
off 1
on 1
his 1
road 1
homewards 1
As 1
he 1
went 1
lazily 1
on 1
dragging 1
one 1
foot 1
after 1
another 1
a 1
man 1
came 1
in 1
sight 1
trotting 1
gaily 1
along 1
on 1
a 1
capital 1
horse 1
Ah 1
said 1
Hans 1
aloud 1
what 1
a 1
fine 1
thing 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
ride 1
on 1
horseback 1
There 1
he 1
sits 1
as 1
easy 1
and 1
happy 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
chair 1
by 1
his 1
fireside 1
he 1
trips 1
against 1
no 1
stones 1
saves 1
shoe 1
leather 1
and 1
gets 1
on 1
he 1
hardly 1
knows 1
how 1
Hans 1
did 1
not 1
speak 1
so 1
softly 1
but 1
the 1
horseman 1
heard 1
it 1
all 1
and 1
said 1
Well 1
friend 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
go 1
on 1
foot 1
then 1
Ah 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
have 1
this 1
load 1
to 1
carry 1
to 1
be 1
sure 1
it 1
is 1
silver 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
heavy 1
that 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
hold 1
up 1
my 1
head 1
and 1
you 1
must 1
know 1
it 1
hurts 1
my 1
shoulder 1
sadly 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
say 1
of 1
making 1
an 1
exchange 1
said 1
the 1
horseman 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
my 1
horse 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
silver 1
which 1
will 1
save 1
you 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
trouble 1
in 1
carrying 1
such 1
a 1
heavy 1
load 1
about 1
with 1
you 1
With 1
all 1
my 1
heart 1
said 1
Hans 1
but 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
so 1
kind 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
must 1
tell 1
you 1
one 1
thing 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
a 1
weary 1
task 1
to 1
draw 1
that 1
silver 1
about 1
with 1
you 1
However 1
the 1
horseman 1
got 1
off 1
took 1
the 1
silver 1
helped 1
Hans 1
up 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
bridle 1
into 1
one 1
hand 1
and 1
the 1
whip 1
into 1
the 1
other 1
and 1
said 1
When 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
very 1
fast 1
smack 1
your 1
lips 1
loudly 1
together 1
and 1
cry 1
Jip 1
Hans 1
was 1
delighted 1
as 1
he 1
sat 1
on 1
the 1
horse 1
drew 1
himself 1
up 1
squared 1
his 1
elbows 1
turned 1
out 1
his 1
toes 1
cracked 1
his 1
whip 1
and 1
rode 1
merrily 1
off 1
one 1
minute 1
whistling 1
a 1
merry 1
tune 1
and 1
another 1
singing 1
No 1
care 1
and 1
no 1
sorrow 1
A 1
fig 1
for 1
the 1
morrow 1
We 1
ll 1
laugh 1
and 1
be 1
merry 1
Sing 1
neigh 1
down 1
derry 1
After 1
a 1
time 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
go 1
a 1
little 1
faster 1
so 1
he 1
smacked 1
his 1
lips 1
and 1
cried 1
Jip 1
Away 1
went 1
the 1
horse 1
full 1
gallop 1
and 1
before 1
Hans 1
knew 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
about 1
he 1
was 1
thrown 1
off 1
and 1
lay 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
by 1
the 1
road 1
side 1
His 1
horse 1
would 1
have 1
ran 1
off 1
if 1
a 1
shepherd 1
who 1
was 1
coming 1
by 1
driving 1
a 1
cow 1
had 1
not 1
stopped 1
it 1
Hans 1
soon 1
came 1
to 1
himself 1
and 1
got 1
upon 1
his 1
legs 1
again 1
sadly 1
vexed 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
shepherd 1
This 1
riding 1
is 1
no 1
joke 1
when 1
a 1
man 1
has 1
the 1
luck 1
to 1
get 1
upon 1
a 1
beast 1
like 1
this 1
that 1
stumbles 1
and 1
flings 1
him 1
off 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
would 1
break 1
his 1
neck 1
However 1
I 1
m 1
off 1
now 1
once 1
for 1
all 1
I 1
like 1
your 1
cow 1
now 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
better 1
than 1
this 1
smart 1
beast 1
that 1
played 1
me 1
this 1
trick 1
and 1
has 1
spoiled 1
my 1
best 1
coat 1
you 1
see 1
in 1
this 1
puddle 1
which 1
by 1
the 1
by 1
smells 1
not 1
very 1
like 1
a 1
nosegay 1
One 1
can 1
walk 1
along 1
at 1
one 1
s 1
leisure 1
behind 1
that 1
cow 1
keep 1
good 1
company 1
and 1
have 1
milk 1
butter 1
and 1
cheese 1
every 1
day 1
into 1
the 1
bargain 1
What 1
would 1
I 1
give 1
to 1
have 1
such 1
a 1
prize 1
Well 1
said 1
the 1
shepherd 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
so 1
fond 1
of 1
her 1
I 1
will 1
change 1
my 1
cow 1
for 1
your 1
horse 1
I 1
like 1
to 1
do 1
good 1
to 1
my 1
neighbours 1
even 1
though 1
I 1
lose 1
by 1
it 1
myself 1
Done 1
said 1
Hans 1
merrily 1
What 1
a 1
noble 1
heart 1
that 1
good 1
man 1
has 1
thought 1
he 1
Then 1
the 1
shepherd 1
jumped 1
upon 1
the 1
horse 1
wished 1
Hans 1
and 1
the 1
cow 1
good 1
morning 1
and 1
away 1
he 1
rode 1
Hans 1
brushed 1
his 1
coat 1
wiped 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
hands 1
rested 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
then 1
drove 1
off 1
his 1
cow 1
quietly 1
and 1
thought 1
his 1
bargain 1
a 1
very 1
lucky 1
one 1
If 1
I 1
have 1
only 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
I 1
certainly 1
shall 1
always 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
get 1
that 1
I 1
can 1
whenever 1
I 1
like 1
eat 1
my 1
butter 1
and 1
cheese 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
am 1
thirsty 1
I 1
can 1
milk 1
my 1
cow 1
and 1
drink 1
the 1
milk 1
and 1
what 1
can 1
I 1
wish 1
for 1
more 1
When 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
an 1
inn 1
he 1
halted 1
ate 1
up 1
all 1
his 1
bread 1
and 1
gave 1
away 1
his 1
last 1
penny 1
for 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
beer 1
When 1
he 1
had 1
rested 1
himself 1
he 1
set 1
off 1
again 1
driving 1
his 1
cow 1
towards 1
his 1
mother 1
s 1
village 1
But 1
the 1
heat 1
grew 1
greater 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
noon 1
came 1
on 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
as 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
on 1
a 1
wide 1
heath 1
that 1
would 1
take 1
him 1
more 1
than 1
an 1
hour 1
to 1
cross 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
hot 1
and 1
parched 1
that 1
his 1
tongue 1
clave 1
to 1
the 1
roof 1
of 1
his 1
mouth 1
I 1
can 1
find 1
a 1
cure 1
for 1
this 1
thought 1
he 1
now 1
I 1
will 1
milk 1
my 1
cow 1
and 1
quench 1
my 1
thirst 1
so 1
he 1
tied 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
stump 1
of 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
held 1
his 1
leathern 1
cap 1
to 1
milk 1
into 1
but 1
not 1
a 1
drop 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
had 1
Who 1
would 1
have 1
thought 1
that 1
this 1
cow 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
bring 1
him 1
milk 1
and 1
butter 1
and 1
cheese 1
was 1
all 1
that 1
time 1
utterly 1
dry 1
Hans 1
had 1
not 1
thought 1
of 1
looking 1
to 1
that 1
While 1
he 1
was 1
trying 1
his 1
luck 1
in 1
milking 1
and 1
managing 1
the 1
matter 1
very 1
clumsily 1
the 1
uneasy 1
beast 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
him 1
very 1
troublesome 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
gave 1
him 1
such 1
a 1
kick 1
on 1
the 1
head 1
as 1
knocked 1
him 1
down 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
lay 1
a 1
long 1
while 1
senseless 1
Luckily 1
a 1
butcher 1
soon 1
came 1
by 1
driving 1
a 1
pig 1
in 1
a 1
wheelbarrow 1
What 1
is 1
the 1
matter 1
with 1
you 1
my 1
man 1
said 1
the 1
butcher 1
as 1
he 1
helped 1
him 1
up 1
Hans 1
told 1
him 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
how 1
he 1
was 1
dry 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
milk 1
his 1
cow 1
but 1
found 1
the 1
cow 1
was 1
dry 1
too 1
Then 1
the 1
butcher 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
flask 1
of 1
ale 1
saying 1
There 1
drink 1
and 1
refresh 1
yourself 1
your 1
cow 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
no 1
milk 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
see 1
she 1
is 1
an 1
old 1
beast 1
good 1
for 1
nothing 1
but 1
the 1
slaughter 1
house 1
Alas 1
alas 1
said 1
Hans 1
who 1
would 1
have 1
thought 1
it 1
What 1
a 1
shame 1
to 1
take 1
my 1
horse 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
only 1
a 1
dry 1
cow 1
If 1
I 1
kill 1
her 1
what 1
will 1
she 1
be 1
good 1
for 1
I 1
hate 1
cow 1
beef 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
tender 1
enough 1
for 1
me 1
If 1
it 1
were 1
a 1
pig 1
now 1
like 1
that 1
fat 1
gentleman 1
you 1
are 1
driving 1
along 1
at 1
his 1
ease 1
one 1
could 1
do 1
something 1
with 1
it 2
would 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
make 1
sausages 1
Well 1
said 1
the 1
butcher 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
to 1
say 1
no 1
when 1
one 1
is 1
asked 1
to 1
do 1
a 1
kind 1
neighbourly 1
thing 1
To 1
please 1
you 1
I 1
will 1
change 1
and 1
give 1
you 1
my 1
fine 1
fat 1
pig 1
for 1
the 1
cow 1
Heaven 1
reward 1
you 1
for 1
your 1
kindness 1
and 1
self 1
denial 1
said 1
Hans 1
as 1
he 1
gave 1
the 1
butcher 1
the 1
cow 1
and 1
taking 1
the 1
pig 1
off 1
the 1
wheel 1
barrow 1
drove 1
it 1
away 1
holding 1
it 1
by 1
the 1
string 1
that 1
was 1
tied 1
to 1
its 1
leg 1
So 1
on 1
he 1
jogged 1
and 1
all 1
seemed 1
now 1
to 1
go 1
right 1
with 1
him 1
he 1
had 1
met 1
with 1
some 1
misfortunes 1
to 1
be 1
sure 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
now 1
well 1
repaid 1
for 1
all 1
How 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
otherwise 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
travelling 1
companion 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
at 1
last 1
got 1
The 1
next 1
man 1
he 1
met 1
was 1
a 1
countryman 1
carrying 1
a 1
fine 1
white 1
goose 1
The 1
countryman 1
stopped 1
to 1
ask 1
what 1
was 1
o 1
clock 1
this 1
led 1
to 1
further 1
chat 1
and 1
Hans 1
told 1
him 1
all 1
his 1
luck 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
so 1
many 1
good 1
bargains 1
and 1
how 1
all 1
the 1
world 1
went 1
gay 1
and 1
smiling 1
with 1
him 1
The 1
countryman 1
then 1
began 1
to 1
tell 1
his 1
tale 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
goose 1
to 1
a 1
christening 1
Feel 1
said 1
he 1
how 1
heavy 1
it 1
is 1
and 1
yet 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
eight 1
weeks 1
old 1
Whoever 1
roasts 1
and 1
eats 1
it 1
will 1
find 1
plenty 1
of 1
fat 1
upon 1
it 2
has 1
lived 1
so 1
well 1
You 1
re 1
right 1
said 1
Hans 1
as 1
he 1
weighed 1
it 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
talk 1
of 1
fat 1
my 1
pig 1
is 1
no 1
trifle 1
Meantime 1
the 1
countryman 1
began 1
to 1
look 1
grave 1
and 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
Hark 1
ye 1
said 1
he 1
my 1
worthy 1
friend 1
you 1
seem 1
a 1
good 1
sort 1
of 1
fellow 1
so 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
help 1
doing 1
you 1
a 1
kind 1
turn 1
Your 1
pig 1
may 1
get 1
you 1
into 1
a 1
scrape 1
In 1
the 1
village 1
I 1
just 1
came 1
from 1
the 1
squire 1
has 1
had 1
a 1
pig 1
stolen 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
sty 1
I 1
was 1
dreadfully 1
afraid 1
when 1
I 1
saw 1
you 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
got 1
the 1
squire 1
s 1
pig 1
If 1
you 1
have 1
and 1
they 1
catch 1
you 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
bad 1
job 1
for 1
you 1
The 1
least 1
they 1
will 1
do 1
will 1
be 1
to 1
throw 1
you 1
into 1
the 1
horse 1
pond 1
Can 1
you 1
swim 1
Poor 1
Hans 1
was 1
sadly 1
frightened 1
Good 1
man 1
cried 1
he 1
pray 1
get 1
me 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
scrape 1
I 1
know 1
nothing 1
of 1
where 1
the 1
pig 1
was 1
either 1
bred 1
or 1
born 1
but 1
he 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
squire 1
s 1
for 1
aught 1
I 1
can 1
tell 1
you 1
know 1
this 1
country 1
better 1
than 1
I 1
do 1
take 1
my 1
pig 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
goose 1
I 1
ought 1
to 1
have 1
something 1
into 1
the 1
bargain 1
said 1
the 1
countryman 1
give 1
a 1
fat 1
goose 1
for 1
a 1
pig 1
indeed 1
Tis 1
not 1
everyone 1
would 1
do 1
so 1
much 1
for 1
you 1
as 1
that 1
However 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
hard 1
upon 1
you 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
in 1
trouble 1
Then 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
string 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
drove 1
off 1
the 1
pig 1
by 1
a 1
side 1
path 1
while 1
Hans 1
went 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
homewards 1
free 1
from 1
care 1
After 1
all 1
thought 1
he 1
that 1
chap 1
is 1
pretty 1
well 1
taken 1
in 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
whose 1
pig 1
it 1
is 1
but 1
wherever 1
it 1
came 1
from 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
very 1
good 1
friend 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
have 1
much 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
the 1
bargain 1
First 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
capital 1
roast 1
then 1
the 1
fat 1
will 1
find 1
me 1
in 1
goose 1
grease 1
for 1
six 1
months 1
and 1
then 1
there 1
are 1
all 1
the 1
beautiful 1
white 1
feathers 1
I 1
will 1
put 1
them 1
into 1
my 1
pillow 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
I 1
shall 1
sleep 1
soundly 1
without 1
rocking 1
How 1
happy 1
my 1
mother 1
will 1
be 1
Talk 1
of 1
a 1
pig 1
indeed 1
Give 1
me 1
a 1
fine 1
fat 1
goose 1
As 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
next 1
village 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
scissor 1
grinder 1
with 1
his 1
wheel 1
working 1
and 1
singing 1
O 1
er 1
hill 1
and 1
o 1
er 1
dale 1
So 1
happy 1
I 1
roam 1
Work 1
light 1
and 1
live 1
well 1
All 1
the 1
world 1
is 1
my 1
home 1
Then 1
who 1
so 1
blythe 1
so 1
merry 1
as 1
I 1
Hans 1
stood 1
looking 1
on 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
said 1
You 1
must 1
be 1
well 1
off 1
master 1
grinder 1
you 1
seem 1
so 1
happy 1
at 1
your 1
work 1
Yes 1
said 1
the 1
other 1
mine 1
is 1
a 1
golden 1
trade 1
a 1
good 1
grinder 1
never 1
puts 1
his 1
hand 1
into 1
his 1
pocket 1
without 1
finding 1
money 1
in 1
it 1
but 1
where 1
did 1
you 1
get 1
that 1
beautiful 1
goose 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
buy 1
it 1
I 1
gave 1
a 1
pig 1
for 1
it 1
And 1
where 1
did 1
you 1
get 1
the 1
pig 1
I 1
gave 1
a 1
cow 1
for 1
it 1
And 1
the 1
cow 1
I 1
gave 1
a 1
horse 1
for 1
it 1
And 1
the 1
horse 1
I 1
gave 1
a 1
lump 1
of 1
silver 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
my 1
head 1
for 1
it 1
And 1
the 1
silver 1
Oh 1
I 1
worked 1
hard 1
for 1
that 1
seven 1
long 1
years 1
You 1
have 1
thriven 1
well 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
hitherto 1
said 1
the 1
grinder 1
now 1
if 1
you 1
could 1
find 1
money 1
in 1
your 1
pocket 1
whenever 1
you 1
put 1
your 1
hand 1
in 1
it 1
your 1
fortune 1
would 1
be 1
made 1
Very 1
true 1
but 1
how 1
is 1
that 1
to 1
be 1
managed 1
How 1
Why 1
you 1
must 1
turn 1
grinder 1
like 1
myself 1
said 1
the 1
other 1
you 1
only 1
want 1
a 1
grindstone 1
the 1
rest 1
will 1
come 1
of 1
itself 1
Here 1
is 1
one 1
that 1
is 1
but 1
little 1
the 1
worse 1
for 1
wear 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
ask 1
more 1
than 1
the 1
value 1
of 1
your 1
goose 1
for 1
it 1
will 1
you 1
buy 1
How 1
can 1
you 1
ask 1
said 1
Hans 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
the 1
happiest 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
have 1
money 1
whenever 1
I 1
put 1
my 1
hand 1
in 1
my 1
pocket 1
what 1
could 1
I 1
want 1
more 1
there 1
s 1
the 1
goose 1
Now 1
said 1
the 1
grinder 1
as 1
he 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
common 1
rough 1
stone 1
that 1
lay 1
by 1
his 1
side 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
most 1
capital 1
stone 1
do 1
but 1
work 1
it 1
well 1
enough 1
and 1
you 1
can 1
make 1
an 1
old 1
nail 1
cut 1
with 1
it 1
Hans 1
took 1
the 1
stone 1
and 1
went 1
his 1
way 1
with 1
a 1
light 1
heart 1
his 1
eyes 1
sparkled 1
for 1
joy 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
Surely 1
I 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
born 1
in 1
a 1
lucky 1
hour 1
everything 1
I 1
could 1
want 1
or 1
wish 1
for 1
comes 1
of 1
itself 1
People 1
are 1
so 1
kind 1
they 1
seem 1
really 1
to 1
think 1
I 1
do 1
them 1
a 1
favour 1
in 1
letting 1
them 1
make 1
me 1
rich 1
and 1
giving 1
me 1
good 1
bargains 1
Meantime 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
be 1
tired 1
and 1
hungry 1
too 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
given 1
away 1
his 1
last 1
penny 1
in 1
his 1
joy 1
at 1
getting 1
the 1
cow 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
could 1
go 1
no 1
farther 1
for 1
the 1
stone 1
tired 1
him 1
sadly 1
and 1
he 1
dragged 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
a 1
river 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
take 1
a 1
drink 1
of 1
water 1
and 1
rest 1
a 1
while 1
So 1
he 1
laid 1
the 1
stone 1
carefully 1
by 1
his 1
side 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
but 1
as 1
he 1
stooped 1
down 1
to 1
drink 1
he 1
forgot 1
it 1
pushed 1
it 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
down 1
it 1
rolled 1
plump 1
into 1
the 1
stream 1
For 1
a 1
while 1
he 1
watched 1
it 1
sinking 1
in 1
the 1
deep 1
clear 1
water 1
then 1
sprang 1
up 1
and 1
danced 1
for 1
joy 1
and 1
again 1
fell 1
upon 1
his 1
knees 1
and 1
thanked 1
Heaven 1
with 1
tears 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
for 1
its 1
kindness 1
in 1
taking 1
away 1
his 1
only 1
plague 1
the 1
ugly 1
heavy 1
stone 1
How 1
happy 1
am 1
I 1
cried 1
he 1
nobody 1
was 1
ever 1
so 1
lucky 1
as 1
I 1
Then 1
up 1
he 1
got 1
with 1
a 1
light 1
heart 1
free 1
from 1
all 1
his 1
troubles 1
and 1
walked 1
on 1
till 1
he 1
reached 1
his 1
mother 1
s 1
house 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
how 1
very 1
easy 1
the 1
road 1
to 1
good 1
luck 1
was 1
JORINDA 1
AND 1
JORINDEL 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
an 1
old 1
castle 1
that 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
a 1
deep 1
gloomy 1
wood 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
castle 1
lived 1
an 1
old 1
fairy 1
Now 1
this 1
fairy 1
could 1
take 1
any 1
shape 1
she 1
pleased 1
All 1
the 1
day 1
long 1
she 1
flew 1
about 1
in 1
the 1
form 1
of 1
an 1
owl 1
or 1
crept 1
about 1
the 1
country 1
like 1
a 1
cat 1
but 1
at 1
night 1
she 1
always 1
became 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
again 1
When 1
any 1
young 1
man 1
came 1
within 1
a 1
hundred 1
paces 1
of 1
her 1
castle 1
he 1
became 1
quite 1
fixed 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
move 1
a 1
step 1
till 1
she 1
came 1
and 1
set 1
him 1
free 1
which 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
do 1
till 1
he 1
had 1
given 1
her 1
his 1
word 1
never 1
to 1
come 1
there 1
again 1
but 1
when 1
any 1
pretty 1
maiden 1
came 1
within 1
that 1
space 1
she 1
was 1
changed 1
into 1
a 1
bird 1
and 1
the 1
fairy 1
put 1
her 1
into 1
a 1
cage 1
and 1
hung 1
her 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
chamber 1
in 1
the 1
castle 1
There 1
were 1
seven 1
hundred 1
of 1
these 1
cages 1
hanging 1
in 1
the 1
castle 1
and 1
all 1
with 1
beautiful 1
birds 1
in 1
them 1
Now 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
maiden 1
whose 1
name 1
was 1
Jorinda 1
She 1
was 1
prettier 1
than 1
all 1
the 1
pretty 1
girls 1
that 1
ever 1
were 1
seen 1
before 1
and 1
a 1
shepherd 1
lad 1
whose 1
name 1
was 1
Jorindel 1
was 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
her 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
soon 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
One 1
day 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
walk 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
be 1
alone 1
and 1
Jorindel 1
said 1
We 1
must 1
take 1
care 1
that 1
we 1
don 1
t 1
go 1
too 1
near 1
to 1
the 1
fairy 1
s 1
castle 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
beautiful 1
evening 1
the 1
last 1
rays 1
of 1
the 1
setting 1
sun 1
shone 1
bright 1
through 1
the 1
long 1
stems 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
upon 1
the 1
green 1
underwood 1
beneath 1
and 1
the 1
turtle 1
doves 1
sang 1
from 1
the 1
tall 1
birches 1
Jorinda 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
gaze 1
upon 1
the 1
sun 1
Jorindel 1
sat 1
by 1
her 1
side 1
and 1
both 1
felt 1
sad 1
they 1
knew 1
not 1
why 1
but 1
it 1
seemed 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
parted 1
from 1
one 1
another 1
for 1
ever 1
They 1
had 1
wandered 1
a 1
long 1
way 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
looked 1
to 1
see 1
which 1
way 1
they 1
should 1
go 1
home 1
they 1
found 1
themselves 1
at 1
a 1
loss 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
path 1
to 1
take 1
The 1
sun 1
was 1
setting 1
fast 1
and 1
already 1
half 1
of 1
its 1
circle 1
had 1
sunk 1
behind 1
the 1
hill 1
Jorindel 1
on 1
a 1
sudden 1
looked 1
behind 1
him 1
and 1
saw 1
through 1
the 1
bushes 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
without 1
knowing 1
it 1
sat 1
down 1
close 1
under 1
the 1
old 1
walls 1
of 1
the 1
castle 1
Then 1
he 1
shrank 1
for 1
fear 1
turned 1
pale 1
and 1
trembled 1
Jorinda 1
was 1
just 1
singing 1
The 1
ring 1
dove 1
sang 1
from 1
the 1
willow 1
spray 1
Well 1
a 1
day 1
Well 1
a 1
day 1
He 1
mourn 1
d 1
for 1
the 1
fate 1
of 1
his 1
darling 1
mate 1
Well 1
a 1
day 1
when 1
her 1
song 1
stopped 1
suddenly 1
Jorindel 1
turned 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
reason 1
and 1
beheld 1
his 1
Jorinda 1
changed 1
into 1
a 1
nightingale 1
so 1
that 1
her 1
song 1
ended 1
with 1
a 1
mournful 1
jug 2
An 1
owl 1
with 1
fiery 1
eyes 1
flew 1
three 1
times 1
round 1
them 1
and 1
three 1
times 1
screamed 1
Tu 1
whu 1
Tu 1
whu 1
Tu 1
whu 1
Jorindel 1
could 1
not 1
move 1
he 1
stood 1
fixed 1
as 1
a 1
stone 1
and 1
could 1
neither 1
weep 1
nor 1
speak 1
nor 1
stir 1
hand 1
or 1
foot 1
And 1
now 1
the 1
sun 1
went 1
quite 1
down 1
the 1
gloomy 1
night 1
came 1
the 1
owl 1
flew 1
into 1
a 1
bush 1
and 1
a 1
moment 1
after 1
the 1
old 1
fairy 1
came 1
forth 1
pale 1
and 1
meagre 1
with 1
staring 1
eyes 1
and 1
a 1
nose 1
and 1
chin 1
that 1
almost 1
met 1
one 1
another 1
She 1
mumbled 1
something 1
to 1
herself 1
seized 1
the 1
nightingale 1
and 1
went 1
away 1
with 1
it 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
Poor 1
Jorindel 1
saw 1
the 1
nightingale 1
was 1
gone 1
but 1
what 1
could 1
he 1
do 1
He 1
could 1
not 1
speak 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
move 1
from 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
he 1
stood 1
At 1
last 1
the 1
fairy 1
came 1
back 1
and 1
sang 1
with 1
a 1
hoarse 1
voice 1
Till 1
the 1
prisoner 1
is 1
fast 1
And 1
her 1
doom 1
is 1
cast 1
There 1
stay 1
Oh 1
stay 1
When 1
the 1
charm 1
is 1
around 1
her 1
And 1
the 1
spell 1
has 1
bound 1
her 1
Hie 1
away 2
On 1
a 1
sudden 1
Jorindel 1
found 1
himself 1
free 1
Then 1
he 1
fell 1
on 1
his 1
knees 1
before 1
the 1
fairy 1
and 1
prayed 1
her 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
back 1
his 1
dear 1
Jorinda 1
but 1
she 1
laughed 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
should 1
never 1
see 1
her 1
again 1
then 1
she 1
went 1
her 1
way 1
He 1
prayed 1
he 1
wept 1
he 1
sorrowed 1
but 1
all 1
in 1
vain 1
Alas 1
he 1
said 1
what 1
will 1
become 1
of 1
me 1
He 1
could 1
not 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
own 1
home 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
a 1
strange 1
village 1
and 1
employed 1
himself 1
in 1
keeping 1
sheep 1
Many 1
a 1
time 1
did 1
he 1
walk 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
as 1
near 1
to 1
the 1
hated 1
castle 1
as 1
he 1
dared 1
go 1
but 1
all 1
in 1
vain 1
he 1
heard 1
or 1
saw 1
nothing 1
of 1
Jorinda 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
dreamt 1
one 1
night 1
that 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
beautiful 1
purple 1
flower 1
and 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
it 1
lay 1
a 1
costly 1
pearl 1
and 1
he 1
dreamt 1
that 1
he 1
plucked 1
the 1
flower 1
and 1
went 1
with 1
it 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
into 1
the 1
castle 1
and 1
that 1
everything 1
he 1
touched 1
with 1
it 1
was 1
disenchanted 1
and 1
that 1
there 1
he 1
found 1
his 1
Jorinda 1
again 1
In 1
the 1
morning 1
when 1
he 1
awoke 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
search 1
over 1
hill 1
and 1
dale 1
for 1
this 1
pretty 1
flower 1
and 1
eight 1
long 1
days 1
he 1
sought 1
for 1
it 1
in 1
vain 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
ninth 1
day 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
he 1
found 1
the 1
beautiful 1
purple 1
flower 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
large 1
dewdrop 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
a 1
costly 1
pearl 1
Then 1
he 1
plucked 1
the 1
flower 1
and 1
set 1
out 1
and 1
travelled 1
day 1
and 1
night 1
till 1
he 1
came 1
again 1
to 1
the 1
castle 1
He 1
walked 1
nearer 1
than 1
a 1
hundred 1
paces 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
yet 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
become 1
fixed 1
as 1
before 1
but 1
found 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
go 1
quite 1
close 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
Jorindel 1
was 1
very 1
glad 1
indeed 1
to 1
see 1
this 1
Then 1
he 1
touched 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
the 1
flower 1
and 1
it 1
sprang 1
open 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
went 1
in 1
through 1
the 1
court 1
and 1
listened 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
so 1
many 1
birds 1
singing 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
chamber 1
where 1
the 1
fairy 1
sat 1
with 1
the 1
seven 1
hundred 1
birds 1
singing 1
in 1
the 1
seven 1
hundred 1
cages 1
When 1
she 1
saw 1
Jorindel 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
angry 1
and 1
screamed 1
with 1
rage 1
but 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
come 1
within 1
two 1
yards 1
of 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
flower 1
he 1
held 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
was 1
his 1
safeguard 1
He 1
looked 1
around 1
at 1
the 1
birds 1
but 1
alas 1
there 1
were 1
many 2
nightingales 1
and 1
how 1
then 1
should 1
he 1
find 1
out 1
which 1
was 1
his 1
Jorinda 1
While 1
he 1
was 1
thinking 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
fairy 1
had 1
taken 1
down 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
cages 1
and 1
was 1
making 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
her 1
way 1
off 1
through 1
the 1
door 1
He 1
ran 1
or 1
flew 1
after 1
her 1
touched 1
the 1
cage 1
with 1
the 1
flower 1
and 1
Jorinda 1
stood 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
threw 1
her 1
arms 1
round 1
his 1
neck 1
looking 1
as 1
beautiful 1
as 1
ever 1
as 1
beautiful 1
as 1
when 1
they 1
walked 1
together 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
Then 1
he 1
touched 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
birds 1
with 1
the 1
flower 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
all 1
took 1
their 1
old 1
forms 1
again 1
and 1
he 1
took 1
Jorinda 1
home 1
where 1
they 1
were 1
married 1
and 1
lived 1
happily 1
together 1
many 1
years 1
and 1
so 1
did 1
a 1
good 1
many 1
other 1
lads 1
whose 1
maidens 1
had 1
been 1
forced 1
to 1
sing 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
fairy 1
s 1
cages 1
by 1
themselves 1
much 1
longer 1
than 1
they 1
liked 1
THE 1
TRAVELLING 1
MUSICIANS 1
An 1
honest 1
farmer 1
had 1
once 1
an 1
ass 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
faithful 1
servant 1
to 1
him 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
years 1
but 1
was 1
now 1
growing 1
old 1
and 1
every 1
day 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
unfit 1
for 1
work 1
His 1
master 1
therefore 1
was 1
tired 1
of 1
keeping 1
him 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
putting 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
the 1
ass 1
who 1
saw 1
that 1
some 1
mischief 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
wind 1
took 1
himself 1
slyly 1
off 1
and 1
began 1
his 1
journey 1
towards 1
the 1
great 1
city 1
For 1
there 1
thought 1
he 1
I 1
may 1
turn 1
musician 1
After 1
he 1
had 1
travelled 1
a 1
little 1
way 1
he 1
spied 1
a 1
dog 1
lying 1
by 1
the 1
roadside 1
and 1
panting 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
tired 1
What 1
makes 1
you 1
pant 1
so 1
my 1
friend 1
said 1
the 1
ass 1
Alas 1
said 1
the 1
dog 1
my 1
master 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
knock 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
head 1
because 1
I 1
am 1
old 1
and 1
weak 1
and 1
can 1
no 1
longer 1
make 1
myself 1
useful 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
hunting 1
so 1
I 1
ran 1
away 1
but 1
what 1
can 1
I 1
do 1
to 1
earn 1
my 1
livelihood 1
Hark 1
ye 1
said 1
the 1
ass 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
great 1
city 1
to 1
turn 1
musician 1
suppose 1
you 1
go 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
try 1
what 1
you 1
can 1
do 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
The 1
dog 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
willing 1
and 1
they 1
jogged 1
on 1
together 1
They 1
had 1
not 1
gone 1
far 1
before 1
they 1
saw 1
a 1
cat 1
sitting 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
road 1
and 1
making 1
a 1
most 1
rueful 1
face 1
Pray 1
my 1
good 1
lady 1
said 1
the 1
ass 1
what 1
s 1
the 1
matter 1
with 1
you 1
You 1
look 1
quite 1
out 1
of 1
spirits 1
Ah 1
me 1
said 1
the 1
cat 1
how 1
can 1
one 1
be 1
in 1
good 1
spirits 1
when 1
one 1
s 1
life 1
is 1
in 1
danger 1
Because 1
I 1
am 1
beginning 1
to 1
grow 1
old 1
and 1
had 1
rather 1
lie 1
at 1
my 1
ease 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
than 1
run 1
about 1
the 1
house 1
after 1
the 1
mice 1
my 1
mistress 1
laid 1
hold 1
of 1
me 1
and 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
drown 1
me 1
and 1
though 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
lucky 1
enough 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
from 1
her 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
am 1
to 1
live 1
upon 1
Oh 1
said 1
the 1
ass 1
by 1
all 1
means 1
go 1
with 1
us 1
to 1
the 1
great 1
city 1
you 1
are 1
a 1
good 1
night 1
singer 1
and 1
may 1
make 1
your 1
fortune 1
as 1
a 1
musician 1
The 1
cat 1
was 1
pleased 1
with 1
the 1
thought 1
and 1
joined 1
the 1
party 1
Soon 1
afterwards 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
passing 1
by 1
a 1
farmyard 1
they 1
saw 1
a 1
cock 1
perched 1
upon 1
a 1
gate 1
and 1
screaming 1
out 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
might 1
and 1
main 1
Bravo 1
said 1
the 1
ass 1
upon 1
my 1
word 1
you 1
make 1
a 1
famous 1
noise 1
pray 1
what 1
is 1
all 1
this 1
about 1
Why 1
said 1
the 1
cock 1
I 1
was 1
just 1
now 1
saying 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
have 1
fine 1
weather 1
for 1
our 1
washing 1
day 1
and 1
yet 1
my 1
mistress 1
and 1
the 1
cook 1
don 1
t 1
thank 1
me 1
for 1
my 1
pains 1
but 1
threaten 1
to 1
cut 1
off 1
my 1
head 1
tomorrow 1
and 1
make 1
broth 1
of 1
me 1
for 1
the 1
guests 1
that 1
are 1
coming 1
on 1
Sunday 1
Heaven 1
forbid 1
said 1
the 1
ass 1
come 1
with 1
us 1
Master 1
Chanticleer 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
better 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
than 1
staying 1
here 1
to 1
have 1
your 1
head 1
cut 1
off 1
Besides 1
who 1
knows 1
If 1
we 1
care 1
to 1
sing 1
in 1
tune 1
we 1
may 1
get 1
up 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
concert 1
so 1
come 1
along 1
with 1
us 1
With 1
all 1
my 1
heart 1
said 1
the 1
cock 1
so 1
they 1
all 1
four 1
went 1
on 1
jollily 1
together 1
They 1
could 1
not 1
however 1
reach 1
the 1
great 1
city 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
so 1
when 1
night 1
came 1
on 1
they 1
went 1
into 1
a 1
wood 1
to 1
sleep 1
The 1
ass 1
and 1
the 1
dog 1
laid 1
themselves 1
down 1
under 1
a 1
great 1
tree 1
and 1
the 1
cat 1
climbed 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
branches 1
while 1
the 1
cock 1
thinking 1
that 1
the 1
higher 1
he 1
sat 1
the 1
safer 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
flew 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
very 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
then 1
according 1
to 1
his 1
custom 1
before 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
sleep 1
looked 1
out 1
on 1
all 1
sides 1
of 1
him 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
everything 1
was 1
well 1
In 1
doing 1
this 1
he 1
saw 1
afar 1
off 1
something 1
bright 1
and 1
shining 1
and 1
calling 1
to 1
his 1
companions 1
said 1
There 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
house 1
no 1
great 1
way 1
off 1
for 1
I 1
see 1
a 1
light 1
If 1
that 1
be 1
the 1
case 1
said 1
the 1
ass 1
we 1
had 1
better 1
change 1
our 1
quarters 1
for 1
our 1
lodging 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
best 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
Besides 1
added 1
the 1
dog 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
the 1
worse 1
for 1
a 1
bone 1
or 1
two 1
or 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
meat 1
So 1
they 1
walked 1
off 1
together 1
towards 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
Chanticleer 1
had 1
seen 1
the 1
light 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
drew 1
near 1
it 1
became 1
larger 1
and 1
brighter 1
till 1
they 1
at 1
last 1
came 1
close 1
to 1
a 1
house 1
in 1
which 1
a 1
gang 1
of 1
robbers 1
lived 1
The 1
ass 1
being 1
the 1
tallest 1
of 1
the 1
company 1
marched 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
peeped 1
in 1
Well 1
Donkey 1
said 1
Chanticleer 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
see 1
What 1
do 1
I 1
see 1
replied 1
the 1
ass 1
Why 1
I 1
see 1
a 1
table 1
spread 1
with 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
good 1
things 1
and 1
robbers 1
sitting 1
round 1
it 1
making 1
merry 1
That 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
noble 1
lodging 1
for 1
us 1
said 1
the 1
cock 1
Yes 1
said 1
the 1
ass 1
if 1
we 1
could 1
only 1
get 1
in 1
so 1
they 1
consulted 1
together 1
how 1
they 1
should 1
contrive 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
robbers 1
out 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
hit 1
upon 1
a 1
plan 1
The 1
ass 1
placed 1
himself 1
upright 1
on 1
his 1
hind 1
legs 1
with 1
his 1
forefeet 1
resting 1
against 1
the 1
window 1
the 1
dog 1
got 1
upon 1
his 1
back 1
the 1
cat 1
scrambled 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
dog 1
s 1
shoulders 1
and 1
the 1
cock 1
flew 1
up 1
and 1
sat 1
upon 1
the 1
cat 1
s 1
head 1
When 1
all 1
was 1
ready 1
a 1
signal 1
was 1
given 1
and 1
they 1
began 1
their 1
music 1
The 1
ass 1
brayed 1
the 1
dog 1
barked 1
the 1
cat 1
mewed 1
and 1
the 1
cock 1
screamed 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
all 1
broke 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
came 1
tumbling 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
amongst 1
the 1
broken 1
glass 1
with 1
a 1
most 1
hideous 1
clatter 1
The 1
robbers 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
not 1
a 1
little 1
frightened 1
by 1
the 1
opening 1
concert 1
had 1
now 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
some 1
frightful 1
hobgoblin 1
had 1
broken 1
in 1
upon 1
them 1
and 1
scampered 1
away 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
The 1
coast 1
once 1
clear 1
our 1
travellers 1
soon 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
dispatched 1
what 1
the 1
robbers 1
had 1
left 1
with 1
as 1
much 1
eagerness 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
expected 1
to 1
eat 1
again 1
for 1
a 1
month 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
satisfied 1
themselves 1
they 1
put 1
out 1
the 1
lights 1
and 1
each 1
once 1
more 1
sought 1
out 1
a 1
resting 1
place 1
to 1
his 1
own 1
liking 1
The 1
donkey 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
upon 1
a 1
heap 1
of 1
straw 1
in 1
the 1
yard 1
the 1
dog 1
stretched 1
himself 1
upon 1
a 1
mat 1
behind 1
the 1
door 1
the 1
cat 1
rolled 1
herself 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
hearth 1
before 1
the 1
warm 1
ashes 1
and 1
the 1
cock 1
perched 1
upon 1
a 1
beam 1
on 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
rather 1
tired 1
with 1
their 1
journey 1
they 1
soon 1
fell 1
asleep 1
But 1
about 1
midnight 1
when 1
the 1
robbers 1
saw 1
from 1
afar 1
that 1
the 1
lights 1
were 1
out 1
and 1
that 1
all 1
seemed 1
quiet 1
they 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
too 1
great 1
a 1
hurry 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
who 1
was 1
bolder 1
than 1
the 1
rest 1
went 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
Finding 1
everything 1
still 1
he 1
marched 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
groped 1
about 1
till 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
match 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
light 1
a 1
candle 1
and 1
then 1
espying 1
the 1
glittering 1
fiery 1
eyes 1
of 1
the 1
cat 1
he 1
mistook 1
them 1
for 1
live 1
coals 1
and 1
held 1
the 1
match 1
to 1
them 1
to 1
light 1
it 1
But 1
the 1
cat 1
not 1
understanding 1
this 1
joke 1
sprang 1
at 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
spat 1
and 1
scratched 1
at 1
him 1
This 1
frightened 1
him 1
dreadfully 1
and 1
away 1
he 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
back 1
door 1
but 1
there 1
the 1
dog 1
jumped 1
up 1
and 1
bit 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
leg 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
crossing 1
over 1
the 1
yard 1
the 1
ass 1
kicked 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
cock 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
awakened 1
by 1
the 1
noise 1
crowed 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
might 1
At 1
this 1
the 1
robber 1
ran 1
back 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
to 1
his 1
comrades 1
and 1
told 1
the 1
captain 1
how 1
a 1
horrid 1
witch 1
had 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
had 1
spat 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
scratched 1
his 1
face 1
with 1
her 1
long 1
bony 1
fingers 1
how 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
knife 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
had 1
hidden 1
himself 1
behind 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
stabbed 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
leg 1
how 1
a 1
black 1
monster 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
yard 1
and 1
struck 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
club 1
and 1
how 1
the 1
devil 1
had 1
sat 1
upon 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
cried 1
out 1
Throw 1
the 1
rascal 1
up 1
here 1
After 1
this 1
the 1
robbers 1
never 1
dared 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
but 1
the 1
musicians 1
were 1
so 1
pleased 1
with 1
their 1
quarters 1
that 1
they 1
took 1
up 1
their 1
abode 1
there 1
and 1
there 1
they 1
are 1
I 1
dare 1
say 1
at 1
this 1
very 1
day 1
OLD 1
SULTAN 1
A 1
shepherd 1
had 1
a 1
faithful 1
dog 1
called 1
Sultan 1
who 1
was 1
grown 1
very 1
old 1
and 1
had 1
lost 1
all 1
his 1
teeth 1
And 1
one 1
day 1
when 1
the 1
shepherd 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
were 1
standing 1
together 1
before 1
the 1
house 1
the 1
shepherd 1
said 1
I 1
will 1
shoot 1
old 1
Sultan 1
tomorrow 1
morning 1
for 1
he 1
is 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
now 1
But 1
his 1
wife 1
said 1
Pray 1
let 1
the 1
poor 1
faithful 1
creature 1
live 1
he 1
has 1
served 1
us 1
well 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
years 1
and 1
we 1
ought 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
livelihood 1
for 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
his 1
days 1
But 1
what 1
can 1
we 1
do 1
with 1
him 1
said 1
the 1
shepherd 1
he 1
has 1
not 1
a 1
tooth 1
in 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
the 1
thieves 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
for 1
him 1
at 1
all 1
to 1
be 1
sure 1
he 1
has 1
served 1
us 1
but 1
then 1
he 1
did 1
it 1
to 1
earn 1
his 1
livelihood 1
tomorrow 1
shall 1
be 1
his 1
last 1
day 1
depend 1
upon 1
it 1
Poor 1
Sultan 1
who 1
was 1
lying 1
close 1
by 1
them 1
heard 1
all 1
that 1
the 1
shepherd 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
said 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
and 1
was 1
very 1
much 1
frightened 1
to 1
think 1
tomorrow 1
would 1
be 1
his 1
last 1
day 1
so 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
his 1
good 1
friend 1
the 1
wolf 1
who 1
lived 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
all 1
his 1
sorrows 1
and 1
how 1
his 1
master 1
meant 1
to 1
kill 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
Make 1
yourself 1
easy 1
said 1
the 1
wolf 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
some 1
good 1
advice 1
Your 1
master 1
you 1
know 1
goes 1
out 1
every 1
morning 1
very 1
early 1
with 1
his 1
wife 1
into 1
the 1
field 1
and 1
they 1
take 1
their 1
little 1
child 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
lay 1
it 1
down 1
behind 1
the 1
hedge 1
in 1
the 1
shade 1
while 1
they 1
are 1
at 1
work 1
Now 1
do 1
you 1
lie 1
down 1
close 1
by 1
the 1
child 1
and 1
pretend 1
to 1
be 1
watching 1
it 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
come 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
and 1
run 1
away 1
with 1
it 1
you 1
must 1
run 1
after 1
me 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
let 1
it 1
drop 1
then 1
you 1
may 1
carry 1
it 1
back 1
and 1
they 1
will 1
think 1
you 1
have 1
saved 1
their 1
child 1
and 1
will 1
be 1
so 1
thankful 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
they 1
will 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
you 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
you 1
live 1
The 1
dog 1
liked 1
this 1
plan 1
very 1
well 1
and 1
accordingly 1
so 1
it 1
was 1
managed 1
The 1
wolf 1
ran 1
with 1
the 1
child 1
a 1
little 1
way 1
the 1
shepherd 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
screamed 1
out 1
but 1
Sultan 1
soon 1
overtook 1
him 1
and 1
carried 1
the 1
poor 1
little 1
thing 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
master 1
and 1
mistress 1
Then 1
the 1
shepherd 1
patted 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
head 1
and 1
said 1
Old 1
Sultan 1
has 1
saved 1
our 1
child 1
from 1
the 1
wolf 1
and 1
therefore 1
he 1
shall 1
live 1
and 1
be 1
well 1
taken 1
care 1
of 1
and 1
have 1
plenty 1
to 1
eat 1
Wife 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
good 1
dinner 1
and 1
let 1
him 1
have 1
my 1
old 1
cushion 1
to 1
sleep 1
on 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
he 1
lives 1
So 1
from 1
this 1
time 1
forward 1
Sultan 1
had 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
wish 1
for 1
Soon 1
afterwards 1
the 1
wolf 1
came 1
and 1
wished 1
him 1
joy 1
and 1
said 1
Now 1
my 1
good 1
fellow 1
you 1
must 1
tell 1
no 1
tales 1
but 1
turn 1
your 1
head 1
the 1
other 1
way 1
when 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
taste 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
shepherd 1
s 1
fine 1
fat 1
sheep 1
No 1
said 1
the 1
Sultan 1
I 1
will 1
be 1
true 1
to 1
my 1
master 1
However 1
the 1
wolf 1
thought 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
joke 1
and 1
came 1
one 1
night 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
dainty 1
morsel 1
But 1
Sultan 1
had 1
told 1
his 1
master 1
what 1
the 1
wolf 1
meant 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
he 1
laid 1
wait 1
for 1
him 1
behind 1
the 1
barn 1
door 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
wolf 1
was 1
busy 1
looking 1
out 1
for 1
a 1
good 1
fat 1
sheep 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
stout 1
cudgel 1
laid 1
about 1
his 1
back 1
that 1
combed 1
his 1
locks 1
for 1
him 1
finely 1
Then 1
the 1
wolf 1
was 1
very 1
angry 1
and 1
called 1
Sultan 1
an 1
old 1
rogue 1
and 1
swore 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
his 1
revenge 1
So 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
the 1
wolf 1
sent 1
the 1
boar 1
to 1
challenge 1
Sultan 1
to 1
come 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
to 1
fight 1
the 1
matter 1
Now 1
Sultan 1
had 1
nobody 1
he 1
could 1
ask 1
to 1
be 1
his 1
second 1
but 1
the 1
shepherd 1
s 1
old 1
three 1
legged 1
cat 1
so 1
he 1
took 1
her 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
poor 1
thing 1
limped 1
along 1
with 1
some 1
trouble 1
she 1
stuck 1
up 1
her 1
tail 1
straight 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
The 1
wolf 1
and 1
the 1
wild 1
boar 1
were 1
first 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
espied 1
their 1
enemies 1
coming 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
cat 1
s 1
long 1
tail 1
standing 1
straight 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
they 1
thought 1
she 1
was 1
carrying 1
a 1
sword 1
for 1
Sultan 1
to 1
fight 1
with 1
and 1
every 1
time 1
she 1
limped 1
they 1
thought 1
she 1
was 1
picking 1
up 1
a 1
stone 1
to 1
throw 1
at 1
them 1
so 1
they 1
said 1
they 1
should 1
not 1
like 1
this 1
way 1
of 1
fighting 1
and 1
the 1
boar 1
lay 1
down 1
behind 1
a 1
bush 1
and 1
the 1
wolf 1
jumped 1
up 1
into 1
a 1
tree 1
Sultan 1
and 1
the 1
cat 1
soon 1
came 1
up 1
and 1
looked 1
about 1
and 1
wondered 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
was 1
there 1
The 1
boar 1
however 1
had 1
not 1
quite 1
hidden 1
himself 1
for 1
his 1
ears 1
stuck 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bush 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
shook 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
a 1
little 1
the 1
cat 1
seeing 1
something 1
move 1
and 1
thinking 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
mouse 1
sprang 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
bit 1
and 1
scratched 1
it 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
boar 1
jumped 1
up 1
and 1
grunted 1
and 1
ran 1
away 1
roaring 1
out 1
Look 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
tree 1
there 1
sits 1
the 1
one 1
who 1
is 1
to 1
blame 1
So 1
they 1
looked 1
up 1
and 1
espied 1
the 1
wolf 1
sitting 1
amongst 1
the 1
branches 1
and 1
they 1
called 1
him 1
a 1
cowardly 1
rascal 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
suffer 1
him 1
to 1
come 1
down 1
till 1
he 1
was 1
heartily 1
ashamed 1
of 1
himself 1
and 1
had 1
promised 1
to 1
be 1
good 1
friends 1
again 1
with 1
old 1
Sultan 1
THE 1
STRAW 1
THE 1
COAL 1
AND 1
THE 1
BEAN 1
In 1
a 1
village 1
dwelt 1
a 1
poor 1
old 1
woman 1
who 1
had 1
gathered 1
together 1
a 1
dish 1
of 1
beans 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
cook 1
them 1
So 1
she 1
made 1
a 1
fire 1
on 1
her 1
hearth 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
burn 1
the 1
quicker 1
she 1
lighted 1
it 1
with 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
straw 1
When 1
she 1
was 1
emptying 1
the 1
beans 1
into 1
the 1
pan 1
one 1
dropped 1
without 1
her 1
observing 1
it 1
and 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
beside 1
a 1
straw 1
and 1
soon 1
afterwards 1
a 1
burning 1
coal 1
from 1
the 1
fire 1
leapt 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
two 1
Then 1
the 1
straw 1
began 1
and 1
said 1
Dear 1
friends 1
from 1
whence 1
do 1
you 1
come 1
here 1
The 1
coal 1
replied 1
I 1
fortunately 1
sprang 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
escaped 1
by 1
sheer 1
force 1
my 1
death 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
certain 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
burnt 1
to 1
ashes 1
The 1
bean 1
said 1
I 1
too 1
have 1
escaped 1
with 1
a 1
whole 1
skin 1
but 1
if 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
had 1
got 1
me 1
into 1
the 1
pan 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
made 1
into 1
broth 1
without 1
any 1
mercy 1
like 1
my 1
comrades 1
And 1
would 1
a 1
better 1
fate 1
have 1
fallen 1
to 1
my 1
lot 1
said 1
the 1
straw 1
The 1
old 1
woman 1
has 1
destroyed 1
all 1
my 1
brethren 1
in 1
fire 1
and 1
smoke 1
she 1
seized 1
sixty 1
of 1
them 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
took 1
their 1
lives 1
I 1
luckily 1
slipped 1
through 1
her 1
fingers 1
But 1
what 1
are 1
we 1
to 1
do 1
now 1
said 1
the 1
coal 1
I 1
think 1
answered 1
the 1
bean 1
that 1
as 1
we 1
have 1
so 1
fortunately 1
escaped 1
death 1
we 1
should 1
keep 1
together 1
like 1
good 1
companions 1
and 1
lest 1
a 1
new 1
mischance 1
should 1
overtake 1
us 1
here 1
we 1
should 1
go 1
away 1
together 1
and 1
repair 1
to 1
a 1
foreign 1
country 1
The 1
proposition 1
pleased 1
the 1
two 1
others 1
and 1
they 1
set 1
out 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
together 1
Soon 1
however 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
little 1
brook 1
and 1
as 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
bridge 1
or 1
foot 1
plank 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
they 1
were 1
to 1
get 1
over 1
it 1
The 1
straw 1
hit 1
on 1
a 1
good 1
idea 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
will 1
lay 1
myself 1
straight 1
across 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
can 1
walk 1
over 1
on 1
me 1
as 1
on 1
a 1
bridge 1
The 1
straw 1
therefore 1
stretched 1
itself 1
from 1
one 1
bank 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
and 1
the 1
coal 1
who 1
was 1
of 1
an 1
impetuous 1
disposition 1
tripped 1
quite 1
boldly 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
newly 1
built 1
bridge 1
But 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
middle 1
and 1
heard 1
the 1
water 1
rushing 1
beneath 1
her 1
she 1
was 1
after 1
all 1
afraid 1
and 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
ventured 1
no 1
farther 1
The 1
straw 1
however 1
began 1
to 1
burn 1
broke 1
in 1
two 1
pieces 1
and 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
stream 1
The 1
coal 1
slipped 1
after 1
her 1
hissed 1
when 1
she 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
breathed 1
her 1
last 1
The 1
bean 1
who 1
had 1
prudently 1
stayed 1
behind 1
on 1
the 1
shore 1
could 1
not 1
but 1
laugh 1
at 1
the 1
event 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
stop 1
and 1
laughed 1
so 1
heartily 1
that 1
she 1
burst 1
It 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
all 1
over 1
with 1
her 1
likewise 1
if 1
by 1
good 1
fortune 1
a 1
tailor 1
who 1
was 1
travelling 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
work 1
had 1
not 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
rest 1
by 1
the 1
brook 1
As 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
compassionate 1
heart 1
he 1
pulled 1
out 1
his 1
needle 1
and 1
thread 1
and 1
sewed 1
her 1
together 1
The 1
bean 1
thanked 1
him 1
most 1
prettily 1
but 1
as 1
the 1
tailor 1
used 1
black 1
thread 1
all 1
beans 1
since 1
then 1
have 1
a 1
black 1
seam 1
BRIAR 1
ROSE 1
A 1
king 1
and 1
queen 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
reigned 1
in 1
a 1
country 1
a 1
great 1
way 1
off 1
where 1
there 1
were 1
in 1
those 1
days 1
fairies 1
Now 1
this 1
king 1
and 1
queen 1
had 1
plenty 1
of 1
money 1
and 1
plenty 1
of 1
fine 1
clothes 1
to 1
wear 1
and 1
plenty 1
of 1
good 1
things 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
drink 1
and 1
a 1
coach 1
to 1
ride 1
out 1
in 1
every 1
day 1
but 1
though 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
married 1
many 1
years 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
children 1
and 1
this 1
grieved 1
them 1
very 1
much 1
indeed 1
But 1
one 1
day 1
as 1
the 1
queen 1
was 1
walking 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
garden 1
she 1
saw 1
a 1
poor 1
little 1
fish 1
that 1
had 1
thrown 1
itself 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
lay 1
gasping 1
and 1
nearly 1
dead 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
Then 1
the 1
queen 1
took 1
pity 1
on 1
the 1
little 1
fish 1
and 1
threw 1
it 1
back 1
again 1
into 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
before 1
it 1
swam 1
away 1
it 1
lifted 1
its 1
head 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
know 1
what 1
your 1
wish 1
is 1
and 1
it 1
shall 1
be 1
fulfilled 1
in 1
return 1
for 1
your 1
kindness 1
to 1
me 1
you 1
will 1
soon 1
have 1
a 1
daughter 1
What 1
the 1
little 1
fish 1
had 1
foretold 1
soon 1
came 1
to 1
pass 1
and 1
the 1
queen 1
had 1
a 1
little 1
girl 1
so 1
very 1
beautiful 1
that 1
the 1
king 1
could 1
not 1
cease 1
looking 1
on 1
it 1
for 1
joy 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
hold 1
a 1
great 1
feast 1
and 1
make 1
merry 1
and 1
show 1
the 1
child 1
to 1
all 1
the 1
land 1
So 1
he 1
asked 1
his 1
kinsmen 1
and 1
nobles 1
and 1
friends 1
and 1
neighbours 1
But 1
the 1
queen 1
said 1
I 1
will 1
have 1
the 1
fairies 1
also 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
be 1
kind 1
and 1
good 1
to 1
our 1
little 1
daughter 1
Now 1
there 1
were 1
thirteen 1
fairies 1
in 1
the 1
kingdom 1
but 1
as 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
queen 1
had 1
only 1
twelve 1
golden 1
dishes 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
eat 1
out 1
of 1
they 1
were 1
forced 1
to 1
leave 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
fairies 1
without 1
asking 1
her 1
So 1
twelve 1
fairies 1
came 1
each 1
with 1
a 1
high 1
red 1
cap 1
on 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
red 1
shoes 1
with 1
high 1
heels 1
on 1
her 1
feet 1
and 1
a 1
long 1
white 1
wand 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
feast 1
was 1
over 1
they 1
gathered 1
round 1
in 1
a 1
ring 1
and 1
gave 1
all 1
their 1
best 1
gifts 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
princess 1
One 1
gave 1
her 1
goodness 1
another 1
beauty 1
another 1
riches 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
till 1
she 1
had 1
all 1
that 1
was 1
good 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
Just 1
as 1
eleven 1
of 1
them 1
had 1
done 1
blessing 1
her 1
a 1
great 1
noise 1
was 1
heard 1
in 1
the 1
courtyard 1
and 1
word 1
was 1
brought 1
that 1
the 1
thirteenth 1
fairy 1
was 1
come 1
with 1
a 1
black 1
cap 1
on 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
black 1
shoes 1
on 1
her 1
feet 1
and 1
a 1
broomstick 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
and 1
presently 1
up 1
she 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
dining 1
hall 1
Now 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
asked 1
to 1
the 1
feast 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
angry 1
and 1
scolded 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
queen 1
very 1
much 1
and 1
set 1
to 1
work 1
to 1
take 1
her 1
revenge 1
So 1
she 1
cried 1
out 1
The 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
shall 1
in 1
her 1
fifteenth 1
year 1
be 1
wounded 1
by 1
a 1
spindle 1
and 1
fall 1
down 1
dead 1
Then 1
the 1
twelfth 1
of 1
the 1
friendly 1
fairies 1
who 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
given 1
her 1
gift 1
came 1
forward 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
the 1
evil 1
wish 1
must 1
be 1
fulfilled 1
but 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
soften 1
its 1
mischief 1
so 1
her 1
gift 1
was 1
that 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
when 1
the 1
spindle 1
wounded 1
her 1
should 1
not 1
really 1
die 1
but 1
should 1
only 1
fall 1
asleep 1
for 1
a 1
hundred 1
years 1
However 1
the 1
king 1
hoped 1
still 1
to 1
save 1
his 1
dear 1
child 1
altogether 1
from 1
the 1
threatened 1
evil 1
so 1
he 1
ordered 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
spindles 1
in 1
the 1
kingdom 1
should 1
be 1
bought 1
up 1
and 1
burnt 1
But 1
all 1
the 1
gifts 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
eleven 1
fairies 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
fulfilled 1
for 1
the 1
princess 1
was 1
so 1
beautiful 1
and 1
well 1
behaved 1
and 1
good 1
and 1
wise 1
that 1
everyone 1
who 1
knew 1
her 1
loved 1
her 1
It 1
happened 1
that 1
on 1
the 1
very 1
day 1
she 1
was 1
fifteen 1
years 1
old 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
queen 1
were 1
not 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
left 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
palace 1
So 1
she 1
roved 1
about 1
by 1
herself 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
all 1
the 1
rooms 1
and 1
chambers 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
an 1
old 1
tower 1
to 1
which 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
narrow 1
staircase 1
ending 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
door 1
In 1
the 1
door 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
golden 1
key 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
turned 1
it 1
the 1
door 1
sprang 1
open 1
and 1
there 1
sat 1
an 1
old 1
lady 1
spinning 1
away 1
very 1
busily 1
Why 1
how 1
now 1
good 1
mother 1
said 1
the 1
princess 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
doing 1
there 1
Spinning 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
and 1
nodded 1
her 1
head 1
humming 1
a 1
tune 1
while 1
buzz 1
went 1
the 1
wheel 1
How 1
prettily 1
that 1
little 1
thing 1
turns 1
round 1
said 1
the 1
princess 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
spindle 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
spin 1
But 1
scarcely 1
had 1
she 1
touched 1
it 1
before 1
the 1
fairy 1
s 1
prophecy 1
was 1
fulfilled 1
the 1
spindle 1
wounded 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
fell 1
down 1
lifeless 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
However 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
dead 1
but 1
had 1
only 1
fallen 1
into 1
a 1
deep 1
sleep 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
queen 1
who 1
had 1
just 1
come 1
home 1
and 1
all 1
their 1
court 1
fell 1
asleep 1
too 1
and 1
the 1
horses 1
slept 1
in 1
the 1
stables 1
and 1
the 1
dogs 1
in 1
the 1
court 1
the 1
pigeons 1
on 1
the 1
house 1
top 1
and 1
the 1
very 1
flies 1
slept 1
upon 1
the 1
walls 1
Even 1
the 1
fire 1
on 1
the 1
hearth 1
left 1
off 1
blazing 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
sleep 1
the 1
jack 1
stopped 1
and 1
the 1
spit 1
that 1
was 1
turning 1
about 1
with 1
a 1
goose 1
upon 1
it 1
for 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
dinner 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
the 1
cook 1
who 1
was 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
pulling 1
the 1
kitchen 1
boy 1
by 1
the 1
hair 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
box 1
on 1
the 1
ear 1
for 1
something 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
amiss 1
let 1
him 1
go 1
and 1
both 1
fell 1
asleep 1
the 1
butler 1
who 1
was 1
slyly 1
tasting 1
the 1
ale 1
fell 1
asleep 1
with 1
the 1
jug 1
at 1
his 1
lips 1
and 1
thus 1
everything 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
slept 1
soundly 1
A 1
large 1
hedge 1
of 1
thorns 1
soon 1
grew 1
round 1
the 1
palace 1
and 1
every 1
year 1
it 1
became 1
higher 1
and 1
thicker 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
old 1
palace 1
was 1
surrounded 1
and 1
hidden 1
so 1
that 1
not 1
even 1
the 1
roof 1
or 1
the 1
chimneys 1
could 1
be 1
seen 1
But 1
there 1
went 1
a 1
report 1
through 1
all 1
the 1
land 1
of 1
the 1
beautiful 1
sleeping 1
Briar 1
Rose 1
for 1
so 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
was 1
called 1
so 1
that 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
several 1
kings 1
sons 1
came 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
break 1
through 1
the 1
thicket 1
into 1
the 1
palace 1
This 1
however 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
could 1
ever 1
do 1
for 1
the 1
thorns 1
and 1
bushes 1
laid 1
hold 1
of 1
them 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
with 1
hands 1
and 1
there 1
they 1
stuck 1
fast 1
and 1
died 1
wretchedly 1
After 1
many 2
years 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
into 1
that 1
land 1
and 1
an 1
old 1
man 1
told 1
him 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
the 1
thicket 1
of 1
thorns 1
and 1
how 1
a 1
beautiful 1
palace 1
stood 1
behind 1
it 1
and 1
how 1
a 1
wonderful 1
princess 1
called 1
Briar 1
Rose 1
lay 1
in 1
it 1
asleep 1
with 1
all 1
her 1
court 1
He 1
told 1
too 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
from 1
his 1
grandfather 1
that 1
many 2
princes 1
had 1
come 1
and 1
had 1
tried 1
to 1
break 1
through 1
the 1
thicket 1
but 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
all 1
stuck 1
fast 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
died 1
Then 1
the 1
young 1
prince 1
said 1
All 1
this 1
shall 1
not 1
frighten 1
me 1
I 1
will 1
go 1
and 1
see 1
this 1
Briar 1
Rose 1
The 1
old 1
man 1
tried 1
to 1
hinder 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
bent 1
upon 1
going 1
Now 1
that 1
very 1
day 1
the 1
hundred 1
years 1
were 1
ended 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
prince 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
thicket 1
he 1
saw 1
nothing 1
but 1
beautiful 1
flowering 1
shrubs 1
through 1
which 1
he 1
went 1
with 1
ease 1
and 1
they 1
shut 1
in 1
after 1
him 1
as 1
thick 1
as 1
ever 1
Then 1
he 1
came 1
at 1
last 1
to 1
the 1
palace 1
and 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
court 1
lay 1
the 1
dogs 1
asleep 1
and 1
the 1
horses 1
were 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
stables 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
sat 1
the 1
pigeons 1
fast 1
asleep 1
with 1
their 1
heads 1
under 1
their 1
wings 1
And 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
palace 1
the 1
flies 1
were 1
sleeping 1
on 1
the 1
walls 1
the 1
spit 1
was 1
standing 1
still 1
the 1
butler 1
had 1
the 1
jug 1
of 1
ale 1
at 1
his 1
lips 1
going 1
to 1
drink 1
a 1
draught 1
the 1
maid 1
sat 1
with 1
a 1
fowl 1
in 1
her 1
lap 1
ready 1
to 1
be 1
plucked 1
and 1
the 1
cook 1
in 1
the 1
kitchen 1
was 1
still 1
holding 1
up 1
her 1
hand 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
beat 1
the 1
boy 1
Then 1
he 1
went 1
on 1
still 1
farther 1
and 1
all 1
was 1
so 1
still 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
hear 1
every 1
breath 1
he 1
drew 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
tower 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
room 1
in 1
which 1
Briar 1
Rose 1
was 1
and 1
there 1
she 1
lay 1
fast 1
asleep 1
on 1
a 1
couch 1
by 1
the 1
window 1
She 1
looked 1
so 1
beautiful 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
take 1
his 1
eyes 1
off 1
her 1
so 1
he 1
stooped 1
down 1
and 1
gave 1
her 1
a 1
kiss 1
But 1
the 1
moment 1
he 1
kissed 1
her 1
she 1
opened 1
her 1
eyes 1
and 1
awoke 1
and 1
smiled 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
they 1
went 1
out 1
together 1
and 1
soon 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
queen 1
also 1
awoke 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
court 1
and 1
gazed 1
on 1
each 1
other 1
with 1
great 1
wonder 1
And 1
the 1
horses 1
shook 1
themselves 1
and 1
the 1
dogs 1
jumped 1
up 1
and 1
barked 1
the 1
pigeons 1
took 1
their 1
heads 1
from 1
under 1
their 1
wings 1
and 1
looked 1
about 1
and 1
flew 1
into 1
the 1
fields 1
the 1
flies 1
on 1
the 1
walls 1
buzzed 1
again 1
the 1
fire 1
in 1
the 1
kitchen 1
blazed 1
up 1
round 1
went 1
the 1
jack 1
and 1
round 1
went 1
the 1
spit 1
with 1
the 1
goose 1
for 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
dinner 1
upon 1
it 1
the 1
butler 1
finished 1
his 1
draught 1
of 1
ale 1
the 1
maid 1
went 1
on 1
plucking 1
the 1
fowl 1
and 1
the 1
cook 1
gave 1
the 1
boy 1
the 1
box 1
on 1
his 1
ear 1
And 1
then 1
the 1
prince 1
and 1
Briar 1
Rose 1
were 1
married 1
and 1
the 1
wedding 1
feast 1
was 1
given 1
and 1
they 1
lived 1
happily 1
together 1
all 1
their 1
lives 1
long 1
THE 1
DOG 1
AND 1
THE 1
SPARROW 1
A 1
shepherd 1
s 1
dog 1
had 1
a 1
master 1
who 1
took 1
no 1
care 1
of 1
him 1
but 1
often 1
let 1
him 1
suffer 1
the 1
greatest 1
hunger 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
could 1
bear 1
it 1
no 1
longer 1
so 1
he 1
took 1
to 1
his 1
heels 1
and 1
off 1
he 1
ran 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
sad 1
and 1
sorrowful 1
mood 1
On 1
the 1
road 1
he 1
met 1
a 1
sparrow 1
that 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
Why 1
are 1
you 1
so 1
sad 1
my 1
friend 1
Because 1
said 1
the 1
dog 1
I 1
am 1
very 2
hungry 1
and 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
eat 1
If 1
that 1
be 1
all 1
answered 1
the 1
sparrow 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
into 1
the 1
next 1
town 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
soon 1
find 1
you 1
plenty 1
of 1
food 1
So 1
on 1
they 1
went 1
together 1
into 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
passed 1
by 1
a 1
butcher 1
s 1
shop 1
the 1
sparrow 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
dog 1
Stand 1
there 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
till 1
I 1
peck 1
you 1
down 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
meat 1
So 1
the 1
sparrow 1
perched 1
upon 1
the 1
shelf 1
and 1
having 1
first 1
looked 1
carefully 1
about 1
her 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
anyone 1
was 1
watching 1
her 1
she 1
pecked 1
and 1
scratched 1
at 1
a 1
steak 1
that 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
shelf 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
down 1
it 1
fell 1
Then 1
the 1
dog 1
snapped 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
scrambled 1
away 1
with 1
it 1
into 1
a 1
corner 1
where 1
he 1
soon 1
ate 1
it 1
all 1
up 1
Well 1
said 1
the 1
sparrow 1
you 1
shall 1
have 1
some 1
more 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
so 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
next 1
shop 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
peck 1
you 1
down 1
another 1
steak 1
When 1
the 1
dog 1
had 1
eaten 1
this 1
too 1
the 1
sparrow 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
Well 1
my 1
good 1
friend 1
have 1
you 1
had 1
enough 1
now 1
I 1
have 1
had 1
plenty 1
of 1
meat 1
answered 1
he 1
but 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
bread 1
to 1
eat 1
after 1
it 1
Come 1
with 1
me 1
then 1
said 1
the 1
sparrow 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
soon 1
have 1
that 1
too 1
So 1
she 1
took 1
him 1
to 1
a 1
baker 1
s 1
shop 1
and 1
pecked 1
at 1
two 1
rolls 1
that 1
lay 1
in 1
the 1
window 1
till 1
they 1
fell 1
down 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
dog 1
still 1
wished 1
for 1
more 1
she 1
took 1
him 1
to 1
another 1
shop 1
and 1
pecked 1
down 1
some 1
more 1
for 1
him 1
When 1
that 1
was 1
eaten 1
the 1
sparrow 1
asked 1
him 1
whether 1
he 1
had 2
enough 1
now 1
Yes 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
now 1
let 1
us 1
take 1
a 1
walk 1
a 1
little 1
way 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
So 1
they 1
both 1
went 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
high 1
road 1
but 1
as 1
the 1
weather 1
was 1
warm 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
gone 1
far 1
before 1
the 1
dog 1
said 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
much 1
tired 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
nap 1
Very 1
well 1
answered 1
the 1
sparrow 1
do 1
so 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
I 1
will 1
perch 1
upon 1
that 1
bush 1
So 1
the 1
dog 1
stretched 1
himself 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
road 1
and 1
fell 1
fast 1
asleep 1
Whilst 1
he 1
slept 1
there 1
came 1
by 1
a 1
carter 1
with 1
a 1
cart 1
drawn 1
by 1
three 1
horses 1
and 1
loaded 1
with 1
two 1
casks 1
of 1
wine 1
The 1
sparrow 1
seeing 1
that 1
the 1
carter 1
did 1
not 1
turn 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
but 1
would 1
go 1
on 1
in 1
the 1
track 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
dog 1
lay 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
drive 1
over 1
him 1
called 1
out 1
Stop 1
stop 1
Mr 1
Carter 1
or 1
it 1
shall 1
be 1
the 1
worse 1
for 1
you 1
But 1
the 1
carter 1
grumbling 1
to 1
himself 1
You 1
make 1
it 1
the 1
worse 1
for 1
me 1
indeed 1
what 1
can 1
you 1
do 1
cracked 1
his 1
whip 1
and 1
drove 1
his 1
cart 1
over 1
the 1
poor 1
dog 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
wheels 1
crushed 1
him 1
to 1
death 1
There 1
cried 1
the 1
sparrow 1
thou 1
cruel 1
villain 1
thou 1
hast 1
killed 1
my 1
friend 1
the 1
dog 1
Now 1
mind 1
what 1
I 1
say 1
This 1
deed 1
of 1
thine 1
shall 1
cost 1
thee 1
all 1
thou 1
art 1
worth 1
Do 1
your 1
worst 1
and 1
welcome 1
said 1
the 1
brute 1
what 1
harm 1
can 1
you 1
do 1
me 1
and 1
passed 1
on 1
But 1
the 1
sparrow 1
crept 1
under 1
the 1
tilt 1
of 1
the 1
cart 1
and 1
pecked 1
at 1
the 1
bung 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
casks 1
till 1
she 1
loosened 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
all 1
the 1
wine 1
ran 1
out 1
without 1
the 1
carter 1
seeing 1
it 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
looked 1
round 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
cart 1
was 1
dripping 1
and 1
the 1
cask 1
quite 1
empty 1
What 1
an 1
unlucky 1
wretch 1
I 1
am 1
cried 1
he 1
Not 1
wretch 1
enough 1
yet 1
said 1
the 1
sparrow 1
as 1
she 1
alighted 1
upon 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
horses 1
and 1
pecked 1
at 1
him 1
till 1
he 1
reared 1
up 1
and 1
kicked 1
When 1
the 1
carter 1
saw 1
this 1
he 1
drew 1
out 1
his 1
hatchet 1
and 1
aimed 1
a 1
blow 1
at 1
the 1
sparrow 1
meaning 1
to 1
kill 1
her 1
but 1
she 1
flew 1
away 1
and 1
the 1
blow 1
fell 1
upon 1
the 1
poor 1
horse 1
s 1
head 1
with 1
such 1
force 1
that 1
he 1
fell 1
down 1
dead 1
Unlucky 1
wretch 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
cried 1
he 1
Not 1
wretch 1
enough 1
yet 1
said 1
the 1
sparrow 1
And 1
as 1
the 1
carter 1
went 1
on 1
with 1
the 1
other 1
two 1
horses 1
she 1
again 1
crept 1
under 1
the 1
tilt 1
of 1
the 1
cart 1
and 1
pecked 1
out 1
the 1
bung 1
of 1
the 1
second 1
cask 1
so 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
wine 1
ran 1
out 1
When 1
the 1
carter 1
saw 1
this 1
he 1
again 1
cried 1
out 1
Miserable 1
wretch 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
But 1
the 1
sparrow 1
answered 1
Not 1
wretch 1
enough 1
yet 1
and 1
perched 1
on 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
second 1
horse 1
and 1
pecked 1
at 1
him 1
too 1
The 1
carter 1
ran 1
up 1
and 1
struck 1
at 1
her 1
again 1
with 1
his 1
hatchet 1
but 1
away 1
she 1
flew 1
and 1
the 1
blow 1
fell 1
upon 1
the 1
second 1
horse 1
and 1
killed 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
spot 1
Unlucky 1
wretch 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
said 1
he 1
Not 1
wretch 1
enough 1
yet 1
said 1
the 1
sparrow 1
and 1
perching 1
upon 1
the 1
third 1
horse 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
peck 1
him 1
too 1
The 1
carter 1
was 1
mad 1
with 1
fury 1
and 1
without 1
looking 1
about 1
him 1
or 1
caring 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
about 1
struck 1
again 1
at 1
the 1
sparrow 1
but 1
killed 1
his 1
third 1
horse 1
as 1
he 1
done 1
the 1
other 1
two 1
Alas 1
miserable 1
wretch 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
cried 1
he 1
Not 1
wretch 1
enough 1
yet 1
answered 1
the 1
sparrow 1
as 1
she 1
flew 1
away 1
now 1
will 1
I 1
plague 1
and 1
punish 1
thee 1
at 1
thy 1
own 1
house 1
The 1
carter 1
was 1
forced 1
at 1
last 1
to 1
leave 1
his 1
cart 1
behind 1
him 1
and 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
overflowing 1
with 1
rage 1
and 1
vexation 1
Alas 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1
what 1
ill 1
luck 1
has 1
befallen 1
me 1
my 1
wine 1
is 1
all 1
spilt 1
and 1
my 1
horses 1
all 1
three 1
dead 1
Alas 1
husband 1
replied 1
she 1
and 1
a 1
wicked 1
bird 1
has 1
come 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
has 1
brought 1
with 1
her 1
all 1
the 1
birds 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
and 1
they 1
have 1
fallen 1
upon 1
our 1
corn 1
in 1
the 1
loft 1
and 1
are 1
eating 1
it 1
up 1
at 1
such 1
a 1
rate 1
Away 1
ran 1
the 1
husband 1
upstairs 1
and 1
saw 1
thousands 1
of 1
birds 1
sitting 1
upon 1
the 1
floor 1
eating 1
up 1
his 1
corn 1
with 1
the 1
sparrow 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
them 1
Unlucky 1
wretch 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
cried 1
the 1
carter 1
for 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
corn 1
was 1
almost 1
all 1
gone 1
Not 1
wretch 1
enough 1
yet 1
said 1
the 1
sparrow 1
thy 1
cruelty 1
shall 1
cost 1
thee 1
thy 1
life 1
yet 1
and 1
away 1
she 1
flew 1
The 1
carter 1
seeing 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
thus 1
lost 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
went 1
down 1
into 1
his 1
kitchen 1
and 1
was 1
still 1
not 1
sorry 1
for 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
but 1
sat 1
himself 1
angrily 1
and 1
sulkily 1
in 1
the 1
chimney 1
corner 1
But 1
the 1
sparrow 1
sat 1
on 1
the 1
outside 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
cried 1
Carter 1
thy 1
cruelty 1
shall 1
cost 1
thee 1
thy 1
life 1
With 1
that 1
he 1
jumped 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
rage 1
seized 1
his 1
hatchet 1
and 1
threw 1
it 1
at 1
the 1
sparrow 1
but 1
it 1
missed 1
her 1
and 1
only 1
broke 1
the 1
window 1
The 1
sparrow 1
now 1
hopped 1
in 1
perched 1
upon 1
the 1
window 1
seat 1
and 1
cried 1
Carter 1
it 1
shall 1
cost 1
thee 1
thy 1
life 1
Then 1
he 1
became 1
mad 1
and 1
blind 1
with 1
rage 1
and 1
struck 1
the 1
window 1
seat 1
with 1
such 1
force 1
that 1
he 1
cleft 1
it 1
in 1
two 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
sparrow 1
flew 1
from 1
place 1
to 1
place 1
the 1
carter 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
were 1
so 1
furious 1
that 1
they 1
broke 1
all 1
their 1
furniture 1
glasses 1
chairs 1
benches 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
walls 1
without 1
touching 1
the 1
bird 1
at 1
all 1
In 1
the 1
end 1
however 1
they 1
caught 1
her 1
and 1
the 1
wife 1
said 1
Shall 1
I 1
kill 1
her 1
at 1
once 1
No 1
cried 1
he 1
that 1
is 1
letting 1
her 1
off 1
too 1
easily 1
she 1
shall 1
die 1
a 1
much 1
more 1
cruel 1
death 1
I 1
will 1
eat 1
her 1
But 1
the 1
sparrow 1
began 1
to 1
flutter 1
about 1
and 1
stretch 1
out 1
her 1
neck 1
and 1
cried 1
Carter 1
it 1
shall 1
cost 1
thee 1
thy 1
life 1
yet 1
With 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
wait 1
no 1
longer 1
so 1
he 1
gave 1
his 1
wife 1
the 1
hatchet 1
and 1
cried 1
Wife 1
strike 1
at 1
the 1
bird 1
and 1
kill 1
her 1
in 1
my 1
hand 1
And 1
the 1
wife 1
struck 1
but 1
she 1
missed 1
her 1
aim 1
and 1
hit 1
her 1
husband 1
on 1
the 1
head 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
fell 1
down 1
dead 1
and 1
the 1
sparrow 1
flew 1
quietly 1
home 1
to 1
her 1
nest 1
THE 1
TWELVE 1
DANCING 1
PRINCESSES 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
king 1
who 1
had 1
twelve 1
beautiful 1
daughters 1
They 1
slept 1
in 1
twelve 1
beds 1
all 1
in 1
one 1
room 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
the 1
doors 1
were 1
shut 1
and 1
locked 1
up 1
but 1
every 1
morning 1
their 1
shoes 1
were 1
found 1
to 1
be 1
quite 1
worn 1
through 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
danced 1
in 1
all 1
night 1
and 1
yet 1
nobody 1
could 1
find 1
out 1
how 1
it 1
happened 1
or 1
where 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
Then 1
the 1
king 1
made 1
it 1
known 1
to 1
all 1
the 1
land 1
that 1
if 1
any 1
person 1
could 1
discover 1
the 1
secret 1
and 1
find 1
out 1
where 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
the 1
princesses 1
danced 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
he 1
should 1
have 1
the 1
one 1
he 1
liked 1
best 1
for 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
should 1
be 1
king 1
after 1
his 1
death 1
but 1
whoever 1
tried 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
succeed 1
after 1
three 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
should 1
be 1
put 1
to 1
death 1
A 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
soon 1
came 1
He 1
was 1
well 1
entertained 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
was 1
taken 1
to 1
the 1
chamber 1
next 1
to 1
the 1
one 1
where 1
the 1
princesses 1
lay 1
in 1
their 1
twelve 1
beds 1
There 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
sit 1
and 1
watch 1
where 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
dance 1
and 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
nothing 1
might 1
pass 1
without 1
his 1
hearing 1
it 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
his 1
chamber 1
was 1
left 1
open 1
But 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
soon 1
fell 1
asleep 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
awoke 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
princesses 1
had 1
all 1
been 1
dancing 1
for 1
the 1
soles 1
of 1
their 1
shoes 1
were 1
full 1
of 1
holes 1
The 1
same 1
thing 1
happened 1
the 1
second 1
and 1
third 1
night 1
so 1
the 1
king 1
ordered 1
his 1
head 1
to 1
be 1
cut 1
off 1
After 1
him 1
came 1
several 1
others 1
but 1
they 1
had 1
all 1
the 1
same 1
luck 1
and 1
all 1
lost 1
their 1
lives 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
manner 1
Now 1
it 1
chanced 1
that 1
an 1
old 1
soldier 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
wounded 1
in 1
battle 1
and 1
could 1
fight 1
no 1
longer 1
passed 1
through 1
the 1
country 1
where 1
this 1
king 1
reigned 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
travelling 1
through 1
a 1
wood 1
he 1
met 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
who 1
asked 1
him 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
I 1
hardly 1
know 1
where 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
or 1
what 1
I 1
had 1
better 1
do 1
said 1
the 1
soldier 1
but 1
I 1
think 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
very 1
well 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
where 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
the 1
princesses 1
dance 1
and 1
then 1
in 1
time 1
I 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
king 1
Well 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
dame 1
that 1
is 1
no 1
very 1
hard 1
task 1
only 1
take 1
care 1
not 1
to 1
drink 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
wine 1
which 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
princesses 1
will 1
bring 1
to 1
you 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
she 1
leaves 1
you 1
pretend 1
to 1
be 1
fast 1
asleep 1
Then 1
she 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
cloak 1
and 1
said 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
you 1
put 1
that 1
on 1
you 1
will 1
become 1
invisible 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
then 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
follow 1
the 1
princesses 1
wherever 1
they 1
go 1
When 1
the 1
soldier 1
heard 1
all 1
this 1
good 1
counsel 1
he 1
determined 1
to 1
try 1
his 1
luck 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
willing 1
to 1
undertake 1
the 1
task 1
He 1
was 1
as 1
well 1
received 1
as 1
the 1
others 1
had 1
been 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
ordered 1
fine 1
royal 1
robes 1
to 1
be 1
given 1
him 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
evening 1
came 1
he 1
was 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
outer 1
chamber 1
Just 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
lie 1
down 1
the 1
eldest 1
of 1
the 1
princesses 1
brought 1
him 1
a 1
cup 1
of 1
wine 1
but 1
the 1
soldier 1
threw 1
it 1
all 1
away 1
secretly 1
taking 1
care 1
not 1
to 1
drink 1
a 1
drop 1
Then 1
he 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
on 1
his 1
bed 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
began 1
to 1
snore 1
very 1
loud 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
fast 1
asleep 1
When 1
the 1
twelve 1
princesses 1
heard 1
this 1
they 1
laughed 1
heartily 1
and 1
the 1
eldest 1
said 1
This 1
fellow 1
too 1
might 1
have 1
done 1
a 1
wiser 1
thing 1
than 1
lose 1
his 1
life 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
Then 1
they 1
rose 1
up 1
and 1
opened 1
their 1
drawers 1
and 1
boxes 1
and 1
took 1
out 1
all 1
their 1
fine 1
clothes 1
and 1
dressed 1
themselves 1
at 1
the 1
glass 1
and 1
skipped 1
about 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
eager 1
to 1
begin 1
dancing 1
But 1
the 1
youngest 1
said 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
how 1
it 1
is 1
while 1
you 1
are 1
so 1
happy 1
I 1
feel 1
very 1
uneasy 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
some 1
mischance 1
will 1
befall 1
us 1
You 1
simpleton 1
said 1
the 1
eldest 1
you 1
are 1
always 1
afraid 1
have 1
you 1
forgotten 1
how 1
many 1
kings 1
sons 1
have 1
already 1
watched 1
in 1
vain 1
And 1
as 1
for 1
this 1
soldier 1
even 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
given 1
him 1
his 1
sleeping 1
draught 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
slept 1
soundly 1
enough 1
When 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
ready 1
they 1
went 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
soldier 1
but 1
he 1
snored 1
on 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
stir 1
hand 1
or 1
foot 1
so 1
they 1
thought 1
they 1
were 1
quite 1
safe 1
and 1
the 1
eldest 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
own 1
bed 1
and 1
clapped 1
her 1
hands 1
and 1
the 1
bed 1
sank 1
into 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
a 1
trap 1
door 1
flew 1
open 1
The 1
soldier 1
saw 1
them 1
going 1
down 1
through 1
the 1
trap 1
door 1
one 1
after 1
another 1
the 1
eldest 1
leading 1
the 1
way 1
and 1
thinking 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
lose 1
he 1
jumped 1
up 1
put 1
on 1
the 1
cloak 1
which 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
had 1
given 1
him 1
and 1
followed 1
them 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
stairs 1
he 1
trod 1
on 1
the 1
gown 1
of 1
the 1
youngest 1
princess 1
and 1
she 1
cried 1
out 1
to 1
her 1
sisters 1
All 1
is 1
not 1
right 1
someone 1
took 1
hold 1
of 1
my 1
gown 1
You 1
silly 1
creature 1
said 1
the 1
eldest 1
it 1
is 1
nothing 1
but 1
a 1
nail 1
in 1
the 1
wall 1
Then 1
down 1
they 1
all 1
went 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
they 1
found 1
themselves 1
in 1
a 1
most 1
delightful 1
grove 1
of 1
trees 1
and 1
the 1
leaves 1
were 1
all 1
of 1
silver 1
and 1
glittered 1
and 1
sparkled 1
beautifully 1
The 1
soldier 1
wished 1
to 1
take 1
away 1
some 1
token 1
of 1
the 1
place 1
so 1
he 1
broke 1
off 1
a 1
little 1
branch 1
and 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
loud 1
noise 1
from 1
the 1
tree 1
Then 1
the 1
youngest 1
daughter 1
said 1
again 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
all 1
is 1
not 1
right 1
did 1
not 1
you 1
hear 1
that 1
noise 1
That 1
never 1
happened 1
before 1
But 1
the 1
eldest 1
said 1
It 1
is 1
only 1
our 1
princes 1
who 1
are 1
shouting 1
for 1
joy 1
at 1
our 1
approach 1
Then 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
another 1
grove 1
of 1
trees 1
where 1
all 1
the 1
leaves 1
were 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
afterwards 1
to 1
a 1
third 1
where 1
the 1
leaves 1
were 1
all 1
glittering 1
diamonds 1
And 1
the 1
soldier 1
broke 1
a 1
branch 1
from 1
each 1
and 1
every 1
time 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
loud 1
noise 1
which 1
made 1
the 1
youngest 1
sister 1
tremble 1
with 1
fear 1
but 1
the 1
eldest 1
still 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
the 1
princes 1
who 1
were 1
crying 1
for 1
joy 1
So 1
they 1
went 1
on 1
till 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
great 1
lake 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
there 1
lay 1
twelve 1
little 1
boats 1
with 1
twelve 1
handsome 1
princes 1
in 1
them 1
who 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
waiting 1
there 1
for 1
the 1
princesses 1
One 1
of 1
the 1
princesses 1
went 1
into 1
each 1
boat 1
and 1
the 1
soldier 1
stepped 1
into 1
the 1
same 1
boat 1
with 1
the 1
youngest 1
As 1
they 1
were 1
rowing 1
over 1
the 1
lake 1
the 1
prince 1
who 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
boat 1
with 1
the 1
youngest 1
princess 1
and 1
the 1
soldier 1
said 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
why 1
it 1
is 1
but 1
though 1
I 1
am 1
rowing 1
with 1
all 1
my 1
might 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
get 1
on 1
so 1
fast 1
as 1
usual 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
quite 1
tired 1
the 1
boat 1
seems 1
very 1
heavy 1
today 1
It 1
is 1
only 1
the 1
heat 1
of 1
the 1
weather 1
said 1
the 1
princess 1
I 1
feel 1
it 1
very 1
warm 1
too 1
On 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
stood 1
a 1
fine 1
illuminated 1
castle 1
from 1
which 1
came 1
the 1
merry 1
music 1
of 1
horns 1
and 1
trumpets 1
There 1
they 1
all 1
landed 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
castle 1
and 1
each 1
prince 1
danced 1
with 1
his 1
princess 1
and 1
the 1
soldier 1
who 1
was 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
invisible 1
danced 1
with 1
them 1
too 1
and 1
when 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
princesses 1
had 1
a 1
cup 1
of 1
wine 1
set 1
by 1
her 1
he 1
drank 1
it 1
all 1
up 1
so 1
that 1
when 1
she 1
put 1
the 1
cup 1
to 1
her 1
mouth 1
it 1
was 1
empty 1
At 1
this 1
too 1
the 1
youngest 1
sister 1
was 1
terribly 1
frightened 1
but 1
the 1
eldest 1
always 1
silenced 1
her 1
They 1
danced 1
on 1
till 1
three 1
o 1
clock 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
then 1
all 1
their 1
shoes 1
were 1
worn 1
out 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
obliged 1
to 1
leave 1
off 1
The 1
princes 1
rowed 1
them 1
back 1
again 1
over 1
the 1
lake 1
but 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
soldier 1
placed 1
himself 1
in 1
the 1
boat 1
with 1
the 1
eldest 1
princess 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
opposite 1
shore 1
they 1
took 1
leave 1
of 1
each 1
other 1
the 1
princesses 1
promising 1
to 1
come 1
again 1
the 1
next 1
night 1
When 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
stairs 1
the 1
soldier 1
ran 1
on 1
before 1
the 1
princesses 1
and 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
twelve 1
sisters 1
slowly 1
came 1
up 1
very 1
much 1
tired 1
they 1
heard 1
him 1
snoring 1
in 1
his 1
bed 1
so 1
they 1
said 1
Now 1
all 1
is 1
quite 1
safe 1
then 1
they 1
undressed 1
themselves 1
put 1
away 1
their 1
fine 1
clothes 1
pulled 1
off 1
their 1
shoes 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
In 1
the 1
morning 1
the 1
soldier 1
said 1
nothing 1
about 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
but 1
determined 1
to 1
see 1
more 1
of 1
this 1
strange 1
adventure 1
and 1
went 1
again 1
the 1
second 1
and 1
third 1
night 1
and 1
every 1
thing 1
happened 1
just 1
as 1
before 1
the 1
princesses 1
danced 1
each 1
time 1
till 1
their 1
shoes 1
were 1
worn 1
to 1
pieces 1
and 1
then 1
returned 1
home 1
However 1
on 1
the 1
third 1
night 1
the 1
soldier 1
carried 1
away 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
golden 1
cups 1
as 1
a 1
token 1
of 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
time 1
came 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
declare 1
the 1
secret 1
he 1
was 1
taken 1
before 1
the 1
king 1
with 1
the 1
three 1
branches 1
and 1
the 1
golden 1
cup 1
and 1
the 1
twelve 1
princesses 1
stood 1
listening 1
behind 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
hear 1
what 1
he 1
would 1
say 1
And 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
asked 1
him 1
Where 1
do 1
my 1
twelve 1
daughters 1
dance 1
at 1
night 1
he 1
answered 1
With 1
twelve 1
princes 1
in 1
a 1
castle 1
under 1
ground 1
And 1
then 1
he 1
told 1
the 1
king 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
happened 1
and 1
showed 1
him 1
the 1
three 1
branches 1
and 1
the 1
golden 1
cup 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
brought 1
with 1
him 1
Then 1
the 1
king 1
called 1
for 1
the 1
princesses 1
and 1
asked 1
them 1
whether 1
what 1
the 1
soldier 1
said 1
was 1
true 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
saw 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
discovered 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
deny 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
they 1
confessed 1
it 1
all 1
And 1
the 1
king 1
asked 1
the 1
soldier 1
which 1
of 1
them 1
he 1
would 1
choose 1
for 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
he 1
answered 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
very 1
young 1
so 1
I 1
will 1
have 1
the 1
eldest 1
And 1
they 1
were 1
married 1
that 1
very 1
day 1
and 1
the 1
soldier 1
was 1
chosen 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
heir 1
THE 1
FISHERMAN 1
AND 1
HIS 1
WIFE 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
fisherman 1
who 1
lived 1
with 1
his 1
wife 1
in 1
a 1
pigsty 1
close 1
by 1
the 1
seaside 1
The 1
fisherman 1
used 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
all 1
day 1
long 1
a 1
fishing 1
and 1
one 1
day 1
as 1
he 1
sat 1
on 1
the 1
shore 1
with 1
his 1
rod 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
sparkling 1
waves 1
and 1
watching 1
his 1
line 1
all 1
on 1
a 1
sudden 1
his 1
float 1
was 1
dragged 1
away 1
deep 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
in 1
drawing 1
it 1
up 1
he 1
pulled 1
out 1
a 1
great 1
fish 1
But 1
the 1
fish 1
said 1
Pray 1
let 1
me 1
live 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
a 1
real 1
fish 1
I 1
am 1
an 1
enchanted 1
prince 1
put 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
again 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
Oh 1
ho 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
you 1
need 1
not 1
make 1
so 1
many 1
words 1
about 1
the 1
matter 1
I 1
will 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
a 1
fish 1
that 1
can 1
talk 1
so 1
swim 1
away 1
sir 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
you 1
please 1
Then 1
he 1
put 1
him 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
the 1
fish 1
darted 1
straight 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
and 1
left 1
a 1
long 1
streak 1
of 1
blood 1
behind 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
wave 1
When 1
the 1
fisherman 1
went 1
home 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1
in 1
the 1
pigsty 1
he 1
told 1
her 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
caught 1
a 1
great 1
fish 1
and 1
how 1
it 1
had 1
told 1
him 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
enchanted 1
prince 1
and 1
how 1
on 1
hearing 1
it 1
speak 1
he 1
had 1
let 1
it 1
go 1
again 1
Did 1
not 1
you 1
ask 1
it 1
for 1
anything 1
said 1
the 1
wife 1
we 1
live 1
very 1
wretchedly 1
here 1
in 1
this 1
nasty 1
dirty 1
pigsty 1
do 1
go 1
back 1
and 1
tell 1
the 1
fish 1
we 1
want 1
a 1
snug 1
little 1
cottage 1
The 1
fisherman 1
did 1
not 1
much 1
like 1
the 1
business 1
however 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
seashore 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
there 1
the 1
water 1
looked 1
all 1
yellow 1
and 1
green 1
And 1
he 1
stood 1
at 1
the 1
water 1
s 1
edge 1
and 1
said 1
O 1
man 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
Hearken 1
to 1
me 1
My 1
wife 1
Ilsabill 1
Will 1
have 1
her 1
own 1
will 1
And 1
hath 1
sent 1
me 1
to 1
beg 1
a 1
boon 1
of 1
thee 1
Then 1
the 1
fish 1
came 1
swimming 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
Well 1
what 1
is 1
her 1
will 1
What 1
does 1
your 1
wife 1
want 1
Ah 1
said 1
the 1
fisherman 1
she 1
says 1
that 1
when 1
I 1
had 1
caught 1
you 1
I 1
ought 1
to 1
have 1
asked 1
you 1
for 1
something 1
before 1
I 1
let 1
you 1
go 1
she 1
does 1
not 1
like 1
living 1
any 1
longer 1
in 1
the 1
pigsty 1
and 1
wants 1
a 1
snug 1
little 1
cottage 1
Go 1
home 1
then 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
she 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
cottage 1
already 1
So 1
the 1
man 1
went 1
home 1
and 1
saw 1
his 1
wife 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
a 1
nice 1
trim 1
little 1
cottage 1
Come 1
in 1
come 1
in 1
said 1
she 1
is 1
not 1
this 1
much 1
better 1
than 1
the 1
filthy 1
pigsty 1
we 1
had 1
And 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
parlour 1
and 1
a 1
bedchamber 1
and 1
a 1
kitchen 1
and 1
behind 1
the 1
cottage 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
garden 1
planted 1
with 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
flowers 1
and 1
fruits 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
courtyard 1
behind 1
full 1
of 1
ducks 1
and 1
chickens 1
Ah 1
said 1
the 1
fisherman 1
how 1
happily 1
we 1
shall 1
live 1
now 1
We 1
will 1
try 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
at 1
least 1
said 1
his 1
wife 1
Everything 1
went 1
right 1
for 1
a 1
week 1
or 1
two 1
and 1
then 1
Dame 1
Ilsabill 1
said 1
Husband 1
there 1
is 1
not 1
near 1
room 1
enough 1
for 1
us 1
in 1
this 1
cottage 1
the 1
courtyard 1
and 1
the 1
garden 1
are 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
too 1
small 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
large 1
stone 1
castle 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
fish 1
again 1
and 1
tell 1
him 1
to 1
give 1
us 1
a 1
castle 1
Wife 1
said 1
the 1
fisherman 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
him 1
again 1
for 1
perhaps 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
angry 1
we 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
easy 1
with 1
this 1
pretty 1
cottage 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
Nonsense 1
said 1
the 1
wife 1
he 1
will 1
do 1
it 1
very 1
willingly 1
I 1
know 1
go 1
along 1
and 1
try 1
The 1
fisherman 1
went 1
but 1
his 1
heart 1
was 1
very 1
heavy 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
sea 1
it 1
looked 1
blue 1
and 1
gloomy 1
though 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
calm 1
and 1
he 1
went 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
waves 1
and 1
said 1
O 1
man 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
Hearken 1
to 1
me 1
My 1
wife 1
Ilsabill 1
Will 1
have 1
her 1
own 1
will 1
And 1
hath 1
sent 1
me 1
to 1
beg 1
a 1
boon 1
of 1
thee 1
Well 1
what 1
does 1
she 1
want 1
now 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
Ah 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
dolefully 1
my 1
wife 1
wants 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
a 1
stone 1
castle 1
Go 1
home 1
then 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
she 1
is 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
gate 1
of 1
it 1
already 1
So 1
away 1
went 1
the 1
fisherman 1
and 1
found 1
his 1
wife 1
standing 1
before 1
the 1
gate 1
of 1
a 1
great 1
castle 1
See 1
said 1
she 1
is 1
not 1
this 1
grand 1
With 1
that 1
they 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
castle 1
together 1
and 1
found 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
servants 1
there 1
and 1
the 1
rooms 1
all 1
richly 1
furnished 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
golden 1
chairs 1
and 1
tables 1
and 1
behind 1
the 1
castle 1
was 1
a 1
garden 1
and 1
around 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
park 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
long 1
full 1
of 1
sheep 1
and 1
goats 1
and 1
hares 1
and 1
deer 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
courtyard 1
were 1
stables 1
and 1
cow 1
houses 1
Well 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
now 1
we 1
will 1
live 1
cheerful 1
and 1
happy 1
in 1
this 1
beautiful 1
castle 1
for 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
our 1
lives 1
Perhaps 1
we 1
may 1
said 1
the 1
wife 1
but 1
let 1
us 1
sleep 1
upon 1
it 1
before 1
we 1
make 1
up 1
our 1
minds 1
to 1
that 1
So 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
The 1
next 1
morning 1
when 1
Dame 1
Ilsabill 1
awoke 1
it 1
was 1
broad 1
daylight 1
and 1
she 1
jogged 1
the 1
fisherman 1
with 1
her 1
elbow 1
and 1
said 1
Get 1
up 1
husband 1
and 1
bestir 1
yourself 1
for 1
we 1
must 1
be 1
king 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
land 1
Wife 1
wife 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
why 1
should 1
we 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
king 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
king 1
Then 1
I 1
will 1
said 1
she 1
But 1
wife 1
said 1
the 1
fisherman 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
be 1
king 1
the 1
fish 1
cannot 1
make 1
you 1
a 1
king 1
Husband 1
said 1
she 1
say 1
no 1
more 1
about 1
it 1
but 1
go 1
and 1
try 1
I 1
will 1
be 1
king 1
So 1
the 1
man 1
went 1
away 1
quite 1
sorrowful 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
his 1
wife 1
should 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
king 1
This 1
time 1
the 1
sea 1
looked 1
a 1
dark 1
grey 1
colour 1
and 1
was 1
overspread 1
with 1
curling 1
waves 1
and 1
the 1
ridges 1
of 1
foam 1
as 1
he 1
cried 1
out 1
O 1
man 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
Hearken 1
to 1
me 1
My 1
wife 1
Ilsabill 1
Will 1
have 1
her 1
own 1
will 1
And 1
hath 1
sent 1
me 1
to 1
beg 1
a 1
boon 1
of 1
thee 1
Well 1
what 1
would 1
she 1
have 1
now 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
Alas 1
said 1
the 1
poor 1
man 1
my 1
wife 1
wants 1
to 1
be 1
king 1
Go 1
home 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
she 1
is 1
king 1
already 1
Then 1
the 1
fisherman 1
went 1
home 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
came 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
palace 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
troop 1
of 1
soldiers 1
and 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
drums 1
and 1
trumpets 1
And 1
when 1
he 1
went 1
in 1
he 1
saw 1
his 1
wife 1
sitting 1
on 1
a 1
throne 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
diamonds 1
with 1
a 1
golden 1
crown 1
upon 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
of 1
her 1
stood 1
six 1
fair 1
maidens 1
each 1
a 1
head 1
taller 1
than 1
the 1
other 1
Well 1
wife 1
said 1
the 1
fisherman 1
are 1
you 1
king 1
Yes 1
said 1
she 1
I 1
am 1
king 1
And 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
looked 1
at 1
her 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
he 1
said 1
Ah 1
wife 1
what 1
a 1
fine 1
thing 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
king 1
Now 1
we 1
shall 1
never 1
have 1
anything 1
more 1
to 1
wish 1
for 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
we 1
live 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
how 1
that 1
may 1
be 1
said 1
she 1
never 1
is 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
I 1
am 1
king 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
but 1
I 1
begin 1
to 1
be 1
tired 1
of 1
that 1
and 1
I 1
think 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
be 1
emperor 1
Alas 1
wife 1
why 1
should 1
you 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
emperor 1
said 1
the 1
fisherman 1
Husband 1
said 1
she 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
fish 1
I 1
say 1
I 1
will 1
be 1
emperor 1
Ah 1
wife 1
replied 1
the 1
fisherman 1
the 1
fish 1
cannot 1
make 1
an 1
emperor 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
and 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
like 1
to 1
ask 1
him 1
for 1
such 1
a 1
thing 1
I 1
am 1
king 1
said 1
Ilsabill 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
my 1
slave 1
so 1
go 1
at 1
once 1
So 1
the 1
fisherman 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
he 1
muttered 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
along 1
This 1
will 1
come 1
to 1
no 1
good 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
much 1
to 1
ask 1
the 1
fish 1
will 1
be 1
tired 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
sorry 1
for 1
what 1
we 1
have 1
done 1
He 1
soon 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
seashore 1
and 1
the 1
water 1
was 1
quite 1
black 1
and 1
muddy 1
and 1
a 1
mighty 1
whirlwind 1
blew 1
over 1
the 1
waves 1
and 1
rolled 1
them 1
about 1
but 1
he 1
went 1
as 1
near 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
to 1
the 1
water 1
s 1
brink 1
and 1
said 1
O 1
man 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
Hearken 1
to 1
me 1
My 1
wife 1
Ilsabill 1
Will 1
have 1
her 1
own 1
will 1
And 1
hath 1
sent 1
me 1
to 1
beg 1
a 1
boon 1
of 1
thee 1
What 1
would 1
she 1
have 1
now 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
Ah 1
said 1
the 1
fisherman 1
she 1
wants 1
to 1
be 1
emperor 1
Go 1
home 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
she 1
is 1
emperor 1
already 1
So 1
he 1
went 1
home 1
again 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
came 1
near 1
he 1
saw 1
his 1
wife 1
Ilsabill 1
sitting 1
on 1
a 1
very 1
lofty 1
throne 1
made 1
of 1
solid 1
gold 1
with 1
a 1
great 1
crown 1
on 1
her 1
head 1
full 1
two 1
yards 1
high 1
and 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
of 1
her 1
stood 1
her 1
guards 1
and 1
attendants 1
in 1
a 1
row 1
each 1
one 1
smaller 1
than 1
the 1
other 1
from 1
the 1
tallest 1
giant 1
down 1
to 1
a 1
little 1
dwarf 1
no 1
bigger 1
than 1
my 1
finger 1
And 1
before 1
her 1
stood 1
princes 1
and 1
dukes 1
and 1
earls 1
and 1
the 1
fisherman 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
Wife 1
are 1
you 1
emperor 1
Yes 1
said 1
she 1
I 1
am 1
emperor 1
Ah 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
as 1
he 1
gazed 1
upon 1
her 1
what 1
a 1
fine 1
thing 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
emperor 1
Husband 1
said 1
she 1
why 1
should 1
we 1
stop 1
at 1
being 1
emperor 1
I 1
will 1
be 1
pope 1
next 1
O 1
wife 2
said 1
he 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
be 1
pope 1
there 1
is 1
but 1
one 1
pope 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
in 1
Christendom 1
Husband 1
said 1
she 1
I 1
will 1
be 1
pope 1
this 1
very 1
day 1
But 1
replied 1
the 1
husband 1
the 1
fish 1
cannot 1
make 1
you 1
pope 1
What 1
nonsense 1
said 1
she 1
if 1
he 1
can 1
make 1
an 1
emperor 1
he 1
can 1
make 1
a 1
pope 1
go 1
and 1
try 1
him 1
So 1
the 1
fisherman 1
went 1
But 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
shore 1
the 1
wind 1
was 1
raging 1
and 1
the 1
sea 1
was 1
tossed 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
in 1
boiling 1
waves 1
and 1
the 1
ships 1
were 1
in 1
trouble 1
and 1
rolled 1
fearfully 1
upon 1
the 1
tops 1
of 1
the 1
billows 1
In 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
heavens 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
piece 1
of 1
blue 1
sky 1
but 1
towards 1
the 1
south 1
all 1
was 1
red 1
as 1
if 1
a 1
dreadful 1
storm 1
was 1
rising 1
At 1
this 1
sight 1
the 1
fisherman 1
was 1
dreadfully 1
frightened 1
and 1
he 1
trembled 1
so 1
that 1
his 1
knees 1
knocked 1
together 1
but 1
still 1
he 1
went 1
down 1
near 1
to 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
said 1
O 1
man 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
Hearken 1
to 1
me 1
My 1
wife 1
Ilsabill 1
Will 1
have 1
her 1
own 1
will 1
And 1
hath 1
sent 1
me 1
to 1
beg 1
a 1
boon 1
of 1
thee 1
What 1
does 1
she 1
want 1
now 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
Ah 1
said 1
the 1
fisherman 1
my 1
wife 1
wants 1
to 1
be 1
pope 1
Go 1
home 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
she 1
is 1
pope 1
already 1
Then 1
the 1
fisherman 1
went 1
home 1
and 1
found 1
Ilsabill 1
sitting 1
on 1
a 1
throne 1
that 1
was 1
two 1
miles 1
high 1
And 1
she 1
had 1
three 1
great 1
crowns 1
on 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
around 1
her 1
stood 1
all 1
the 1
pomp 1
and 1
power 1
of 1
the 1
Church 1
And 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
of 1
her 1
were 1
two 1
rows 1
of 1
burning 1
lights 1
of 1
all 1
sizes 1
the 1
greatest 1
as 1
large 1
as 1
the 1
highest 1
and 1
biggest 1
tower 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
the 1
least 1
no 1
larger 1
than 1
a 1
small 1
rushlight 1
Wife 1
said 1
the 1
fisherman 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
at 1
all 1
this 1
greatness 1
are 1
you 1
pope 1
Yes 1
said 1
she 1
I 1
am 1
pope 1
Well 1
wife 1
replied 1
he 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
grand 1
thing 1
to 1
be 1
pope 1
and 1
now 1
you 1
must 1
be 1
easy 1
for 1
you 1
can 1
be 1
nothing 1
greater 1
I 1
will 1
think 1
about 1
that 1
said 1
the 1
wife 1
Then 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
but 1
Dame 1
Ilsabill 1
could 1
not 1
sleep 1
all 1
night 1
for 1
thinking 1
what 1
she 1
should 1
be 1
next 1
At 1
last 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
dropping 1
asleep 1
morning 1
broke 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
rose 1
Ha 1
thought 1
she 1
as 1
she 1
woke 1
up 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
it 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
after 1
all 1
I 1
cannot 1
prevent 1
the 1
sun 1
rising 1
At 1
this 1
thought 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
angry 1
and 1
wakened 1
her 1
husband 1
and 1
said 1
Husband 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
fish 1
and 1
tell 1
him 1
I 1
must 1
be 1
lord 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
moon 1
The 1
fisherman 1
was 1
half 1
asleep 1
but 1
the 1
thought 1
frightened 1
him 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
he 1
started 1
and 1
fell 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
Alas 1
wife 1
said 1
he 1
cannot 1
you 1
be 1
easy 1
with 1
being 1
pope 1
No 1
said 1
she 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
uneasy 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
moon 1
rise 1
without 1
my 1
leave 1
Go 1
to 1
the 1
fish 1
at 1
once 1
Then 1
the 1
man 1
went 1
shivering 1
with 1
fear 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
shore 1
a 1
dreadful 1
storm 1
arose 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
the 1
very 1
rocks 1
shook 1
And 1
all 1
the 1
heavens 1
became 1
black 1
with 1
stormy 1
clouds 1
and 1
the 1
lightnings 1
played 1
and 1
the 1
thunders 1
rolled 1
and 1
you 1
might 1
have 1
seen 1
in 1
the 1
sea 1
great 1
black 1
waves 1
swelling 1
up 1
like 1
mountains 1
with 1
crowns 1
of 1
white 1
foam 1
upon 1
their 1
heads 1
And 1
the 1
fisherman 1
crept 1
towards 1
the 1
sea 1
and 1
cried 1
out 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
O 1
man 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
Hearken 1
to 1
me 1
My 1
wife 1
Ilsabill 1
Will 1
have 1
her 1
own 1
will 1
And 1
hath 1
sent 1
me 1
to 1
beg 1
a 1
boon 1
of 1
thee 1
What 1
does 1
she 1
want 1
now 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
Ah 1
said 1
he 1
she 1
wants 1
to 1
be 1
lord 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
moon 1
Go 1
home 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
to 1
your 1
pigsty 1
again 1
And 1
there 1
they 1
live 1
to 1
this 1
very 1
day 1
THE 1
WILLOW 1
WREN 1
AND 1
THE 1
BEAR 1
Once 1
in 1
summer 1
time 1
the 1
bear 1
and 1
the 1
wolf 1
were 1
walking 1
in 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
the 1
bear 1
heard 1
a 1
bird 1
singing 1
so 1
beautifully 1
that 1
he 1
said 1
Brother 1
wolf 1
what 1
bird 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
sings 1
so 1
well 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
King 1
of 1
birds 1
said 1
the 1
wolf 1
before 1
whom 1
we 1
must 1
bow 1
down 1
In 1
reality 1
the 1
bird 1
was 1
the 1
willow 1
wren 1
IF 1
that 1
s 1
the 1
case 1
said 1
the 1
bear 1
I 1
should 1
very 1
much 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
his 1
royal 1
palace 1
come 1
take 1
me 1
thither 1
That 1
is 1
not 1
done 1
quite 1
as 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
think 1
said 1
the 1
wolf 1
you 1
must 1
wait 1
until 1
the 1
Queen 1
comes 1
Soon 1
afterwards 1
the 1
Queen 1
arrived 1
with 1
some 1
food 1
in 1
her 1
beak 1
and 1
the 1
lord 1
King 1
came 1
too 1
and 1
they 1
began 1
to 1
feed 1
their 1
young 1
ones 1
The 1
bear 1
would 1
have 1
liked 1
to 1
go 1
at 1
once 1
but 1
the 1
wolf 1
held 1
him 1
back 1
by 1
the 1
sleeve 1
and 1
said 1
No 1
you 1
must 1
wait 1
until 1
the 1
lord 1
and 1
lady 1
Queen 1
have 1
gone 1
away 1
again 1
So 1
they 1
took 1
stock 1
of 1
the 1
hole 1
where 1
the 1
nest 1
lay 1
and 1
trotted 1
away 1
The 1
bear 1
however 1
could 1
not 1
rest 1
until 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
the 1
royal 1
palace 1
and 1
when 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
had 1
passed 1
went 1
to 1
it 1
again 1
The 1
King 1
and 1
Queen 1
had 1
just 1
flown 1
out 1
so 1
he 1
peeped 1
in 1
and 1
saw 1
five 1
or 1
six 1
young 1
ones 1
lying 1
there 1
Is 1
that 1
the 1
royal 1
palace 1
cried 1
the 1
bear 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
wretched 1
palace 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
King 1
s 1
children 1
you 1
are 1
disreputable 1
children 1
When 1
the 1
young 1
wrens 1
heard 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
frightfully 1
angry 1
and 1
screamed 1
No 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
Our 1
parents 1
are 1
honest 1
people 1
Bear 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
to 1
pay 1
for 1
that 1
The 1
bear 1
and 1
the 1
wolf 1
grew 1
uneasy 1
and 1
turned 1
back 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
their 1
holes 1
The 1
young 1
willow 1
wrens 1
however 1
continued 1
to 1
cry 1
and 1
scream 1
and 1
when 1
their 1
parents 1
again 1
brought 1
food 1
they 1
said 1
We 1
will 1
not 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
touch 1
one 1
fly 1
s 1
leg 1
no 1
not 1
if 1
we 1
were 1
dying 1
of 1
hunger 1
until 1
you 1
have 1
settled 1
whether 1
we 1
are 1
respectable 1
children 1
or 1
not 1
the 1
bear 1
has 1
been 1
here 1
and 1
has 1
insulted 1
us 1
Then 1
the 1
old 1
King 1
said 1
Be 1
easy 1
he 1
shall 1
be 1
punished 1
and 1
he 1
at 1
once 1
flew 1
with 1
the 1
Queen 1
to 1
the 1
bear 1
s 1
cave 1
and 1
called 1
in 1
Old 1
Growler 1
why 1
have 1
you 1
insulted 1
my 1
children 1
You 1
shall 1
suffer 1
for 1
it 1
we 1
will 1
punish 1
you 1
by 1
a 1
bloody 1
war 1
Thus 1
war 1
was 1
announced 1
to 1
the 1
Bear 1
and 1
all 1
four 1
footed 1
animals 1
were 1
summoned 1
to 1
take 1
part 1
in 1
it 1
oxen 1
asses 1
cows 1
deer 1
and 1
every 1
other 1
animal 1
the 1
earth 1
contained 1
And 1
the 1
willow 1
wren 1
summoned 1
everything 1
which 1
flew 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
not 1
only 1
birds 1
large 1
and 1
small 1
but 1
midges 1
and 1
hornets 1
bees 1
and 1
flies 1
had 1
to 1
come 1
When 1
the 1
time 1
came 1
for 1
the 1
war 1
to 1
begin 1
the 1
willow 1
wren 1
sent 1
out 1
spies 1
to 1
discover 1
who 1
was 1
the 1
enemy 1
s 1
commander 1
in 1
chief 1
The 1
gnat 1
who 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
crafty 1
flew 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
where 1
the 1
enemy 1
was 1
assembled 1
and 1
hid 1
herself 1
beneath 1
a 1
leaf 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
where 1
the 1
password 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
announced 1
There 1
stood 1
the 1
bear 1
and 1
he 1
called 1
the 1
fox 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
Fox 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
most 1
cunning 1
of 1
all 1
animals 1
you 1
shall 1
be 1
general 1
and 1
lead 1
us 1
Good 1
said 1
the 1
fox 1
but 1
what 1
signal 1
shall 1
we 1
agree 1
upon 1
No 1
one 1
knew 1
that 1
so 1
the 1
fox 1
said 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
fine 1
long 1
bushy 1
tail 1
which 1
almost 1
looks 1
like 1
a 1
plume 1
of 1
red 1
feathers 1
When 1
I 1
lift 1
my 1
tail 1
up 1
quite 1
high 1
all 1
is 1
going 1
well 1
and 1
you 1
must 1
charge 1
but 1
if 1
I 1
let 1
it 1
hang 1
down 1
run 1
away 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
When 1
the 1
gnat 1
had 1
heard 1
that 1
she 1
flew 1
away 1
again 1
and 1
revealed 1
everything 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
minutest 1
detail 1
to 1
the 1
willow 1
wren 1
When 1
day 1
broke 1
and 1
the 1
battle 1
was 1
to 1
begin 1
all 1
the 1
four 1
footed 1
animals 1
came 1
running 1
up 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
noise 1
that 1
the 1
earth 1
trembled 1
The 1
willow 1
wren 1
with 1
his 1
army 1
also 1
came 1
flying 1
through 1
the 1
air 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
humming 1
and 1
whirring 1
and 1
swarming 1
that 1
every 1
one 1
was 1
uneasy 1
and 1
afraid 1
and 1
on 1
both 1
sides 1
they 1
advanced 1
against 1
each 1
other 1
But 1
the 1
willow 1
wren 1
sent 1
down 1
the 1
hornet 1
with 1
orders 1
to 1
settle 1
beneath 1
the 1
fox 1
s 1
tail 1
and 1
sting 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
might 1
When 1
the 1
fox 1
felt 1
the 1
first 1
string 1
he 1
started 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
lifted 1
one 1
leg 1
from 1
pain 1
but 1
he 1
bore 1
it 1
and 1
still 1
kept 1
his 1
tail 1
high 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
at 1
the 1
second 1
sting 1
he 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
put 1
it 1
down 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
at 1
the 1
third 1
he 1
could 1
hold 1
out 1
no 1
longer 1
screamed 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
tail 1
between 1
his 1
legs 1
When 1
the 1
animals 1
saw 1
that 1
they 1
thought 1
all 1
was 1
lost 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
flee 1
each 1
into 1
his 1
hole 1
and 1
the 1
birds 1
had 1
won 1
the 1
battle 1
Then 1
the 1
King 1
and 1
Queen 1
flew 1
home 1
to 1
their 1
children 1
and 1
cried 1
Children 1
rejoice 1
eat 1
and 1
drink 1
to 1
your 1
heart 1
s 1
content 1
we 1
have 1
won 1
the 1
battle 1
But 1
the 1
young 1
wrens 1
said 1
We 1
will 1
not 1
eat 1
yet 1
the 1
bear 1
must 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
nest 1
and 1
beg 1
for 1
pardon 1
and 1
say 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
honourable 1
children 1
before 1
we 1
will 1
do 1
that 1
Then 1
the 1
willow 1
wren 1
flew 1
to 1
the 1
bear 1
s 1
hole 1
and 1
cried 1
Growler 1
you 1
are 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
nest 1
to 1
my 1
children 1
and 1
beg 1
their 1
pardon 1
or 1
else 1
every 1
rib 1
of 1
your 1
body 1
shall 1
be 1
broken 1
So 1
the 1
bear 1
crept 1
thither 1
in 1
the 1
greatest 1
fear 1
and 1
begged 1
their 1
pardon 1
And 1
now 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
young 1
wrens 1
were 1
satisfied 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
together 1
and 1
ate 1
and 1
drank 1
and 1
made 1
merry 1
till 1
quite 1
late 1
into 1
the 1
night 1
THE 1
FROG 1
PRINCE 1
One 1
fine 1
evening 1
a 1
young 1
princess 1
put 1
on 1
her 1
bonnet 1
and 1
clogs 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
walk 1
by 1
herself 1
in 1
a 1
wood 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
cool 1
spring 1
of 1
water 1
that 1
rose 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
it 1
she 1
sat 1
herself 1
down 1
to 1
rest 1
a 1
while 1
Now 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
golden 1
ball 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
which 1
was 1
her 1
favourite 1
plaything 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
always 1
tossing 1
it 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
catching 1
it 1
again 1
as 1
it 1
fell 1
After 1
a 1
time 1
she 1
threw 1
it 1
up 1
so 1
high 1
that 1
she 1
missed 1
catching 1
it 1
as 1
it 1
fell 1
and 1
the 1
ball 1
bounded 1
away 1
and 1
rolled 1
along 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
it 1
fell 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
spring 1
The 1
princess 1
looked 1
into 1
the 1
spring 1
after 1
her 1
ball 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
deep 1
so 1
deep 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
see 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
it 1
Then 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
bewail 1
her 1
loss 1
and 1
said 1
Alas 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
only 1
get 1
my 1
ball 1
again 1
I 1
would 1
give 1
all 1
my 1
fine 1
clothes 1
and 1
jewels 1
and 1
everything 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
Whilst 1
she 1
was 1
speaking 1
a 1
frog 1
put 1
its 1
head 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
said 1
Princess 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
weep 1
so 1
bitterly 1
Alas 1
said 1
she 1
what 1
can 1
you 1
do 1
for 1
me 1
you 1
nasty 1
frog 1
My 1
golden 1
ball 1
has 1
fallen 1
into 1
the 1
spring 1
The 1
frog 1
said 1
I 1
want 1
not 1
your 1
pearls 1
and 1
jewels 1
and 1
fine 1
clothes 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
love 1
me 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
live 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
eat 1
from 1
off 1
your 1
golden 1
plate 1
and 1
sleep 1
upon 1
your 1
bed 1
I 1
will 1
bring 1
you 1
your 1
ball 1
again 1
What 1
nonsense 1
thought 1
the 1
princess 1
this 1
silly 1
frog 1
is 1
talking 1
He 1
can 1
never 1
even 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
spring 1
to 1
visit 1
me 1
though 1
he 1
may 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
get 1
my 1
ball 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
therefore 1
I 1
will 1
tell 1
him 1
he 1
shall 1
have 1
what 1
he 1
asks 1
So 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
frog 1
Well 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
bring 1
me 1
my 1
ball 1
I 1
will 1
do 1
all 1
you 1
ask 1
Then 1
the 1
frog 1
put 1
his 1
head 1
down 1
and 1
dived 1
deep 1
under 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
after 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
he 1
came 1
up 1
again 1
with 1
the 1
ball 1
in 1
his 1
mouth 1
and 1
threw 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
spring 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
young 1
princess 1
saw 1
her 1
ball 1
she 1
ran 1
to 1
pick 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
overjoyed 1
to 1
have 1
it 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
again 1
that 1
she 1
never 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
frog 1
but 1
ran 1
home 1
with 1
it 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
she 1
could 1
The 1
frog 1
called 1
after 1
her 1
Stay 1
princess 1
and 1
take 1
me 1
with 1
you 1
as 1
you 1
said 1
But 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
stop 1
to 1
hear 1
a 1
word 1
The 1
next 1
day 1
just 1
as 1
the 1
princess 1
had 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
dinner 1
she 1
heard 1
a 1
strange 1
noise 1
tap 2
plash 2
as 1
if 1
something 1
was 1
coming 1
up 1
the 1
marble 1
staircase 1
and 1
soon 1
afterwards 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
gentle 1
knock 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
voice 1
cried 1
out 1
and 1
said 1
Open 1
the 1
door 1
my 1
princess 1
dear 1
Open 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
thy 1
true 1
love 1
here 1
And 1
mind 1
the 1
words 1
that 1
thou 1
and 1
I 1
said 1
By 1
the 1
fountain 1
cool 1
in 1
the 1
greenwood 1
shade 1
Then 1
the 1
princess 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
opened 1
it 1
and 1
there 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
frog 1
whom 1
she 1
had 1
quite 1
forgotten 1
At 1
this 1
sight 1
she 1
was 1
sadly 1
frightened 1
and 1
shutting 1
the 1
door 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
she 1
could 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
her 1
seat 1
The 1
king 1
her 1
father 1
seeing 1
that 1
something 1
had 1
frightened 1
her 1
asked 1
her 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
matter 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
nasty 1
frog 1
said 1
she 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
that 1
lifted 1
my 1
ball 1
for 1
me 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
spring 1
this 1
morning 1
I 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
live 1
with 1
me 1
here 1
thinking 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
never 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
spring 1
but 1
there 1
he 1
is 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
he 1
wants 1
to 1
come 1
in 1
While 1
she 1
was 1
speaking 1
the 1
frog 1
knocked 1
again 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
said 1
Open 1
the 1
door 1
my 1
princess 1
dear 1
Open 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
thy 1
true 1
love 1
here 1
And 1
mind 1
the 1
words 1
that 1
thou 1
and 1
I 1
said 1
By 1
the 1
fountain 1
cool 1
in 1
the 1
greenwood 1
shade 1
Then 1
the 1
king 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
young 1
princess 1
As 1
you 1
have 1
given 1
your 1
word 1
you 1
must 1
keep 1
it 1
so 1
go 1
and 1
let 1
him 1
in 1
She 1
did 1
so 1
and 1
the 1
frog 1
hopped 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
then 1
straight 1
on 1
tap 2
plash 2
from 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
till 1
he 1
came 1
up 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
where 1
the 1
princess 1
sat 1
Pray 1
lift 1
me 1
upon 1
chair 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
the 1
princess 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
sit 1
next 1
to 1
you 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
this 1
the 1
frog 1
said 1
Put 1
your 1
plate 1
nearer 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
eat 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
This 1
she 1
did 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
eaten 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
he 1
said 1
Now 1
I 1
am 1
tired 1
carry 1
me 1
upstairs 1
and 1
put 1
me 1
into 1
your 1
bed 1
And 1
the 1
princess 1
though 1
very 1
unwilling 1
took 1
him 1
up 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
and 1
put 1
him 1
upon 1
the 1
pillow 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
bed 1
where 1
he 1
slept 1
all 1
night 1
long 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
light 1
he 1
jumped 1
up 1
hopped 1
downstairs 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
Now 1
then 1
thought 1
the 1
princess 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
is 1
gone 1
and 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
troubled 1
with 1
him 1
no 1
more 1
But 1
she 1
was 1
mistaken 1
for 1
when 1
night 1
came 1
again 1
she 1
heard 1
the 1
same 1
tapping 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
the 1
frog 1
came 1
once 1
more 1
and 1
said 1
Open 1
the 1
door 1
my 1
princess 1
dear 1
Open 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
thy 1
true 1
love 1
here 1
And 1
mind 1
the 1
words 1
that 1
thou 1
and 1
I 1
said 1
By 1
the 1
fountain 1
cool 1
in 1
the 1
greenwood 1
shade 1
And 1
when 1
the 1
princess 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
the 1
frog 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
slept 1
upon 1
her 1
pillow 1
as 1
before 1
till 1
the 1
morning 1
broke 1
And 1
the 1
third 1
night 1
he 1
did 1
the 1
same 1
But 1
when 1
the 1
princess 1
awoke 1
on 1
the 1
following 1
morning 1
she 1
was 1
astonished 1
to 1
see 1
instead 1
of 1
the 1
frog 1
a 1
handsome 1
prince 1
gazing 1
on 1
her 1
with 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
eyes 1
she 1
had 1
ever 1
seen 1
and 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
her 1
bed 1
He 1
told 1
her 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
enchanted 1
by 1
a 1
spiteful 1
fairy 1
who 1
had 1
changed 1
him 1
into 1
a 1
frog 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
fated 1
so 1
to 1
abide 1
till 1
some 1
princess 1
should 1
take 1
him 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
spring 1
and 1
let 1
him 1
eat 1
from 1
her 1
plate 1
and 1
sleep 1
upon 1
her 1
bed 1
for 1
three 1
nights 1
You 1
said 1
the 1
prince 1
have 1
broken 1
his 1
cruel 1
charm 1
and 1
now 1
I 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
wish 1
for 1
but 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
go 1
with 1
me 1
into 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
kingdom 1
where 1
I 1
will 1
marry 1
you 1
and 1
love 1
you 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
you 1
live 1
The 1
young 1
princess 1
you 1
may 1
be 1
sure 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
in 1
saying 1
Yes 1
to 1
all 1
this 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
spoke 1
a 1
gay 1
coach 1
drove 1
up 1
with 1
eight 1
beautiful 1
horses 1
decked 1
with 1
plumes 1
of 1
feathers 1
and 1
a 1
golden 1
harness 1
and 1
behind 1
the 1
coach 1
rode 1
the 1
prince 1
s 1
servant 1
faithful 1
Heinrich 1
who 1
had 1
bewailed 1
the 1
misfortunes 1
of 1
his 1
dear 1
master 1
during 1
his 1
enchantment 1
so 1
long 1
and 1
so 1
bitterly 1
that 1
his 1
heart 1
had 1
well 1
nigh 1
burst 1
They 1
then 1
took 1
leave 1
of 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
coach 1
with 1
eight 1
horses 1
and 1
all 1
set 1
out 1
full 1
of 1
joy 1
and 1
merriment 1
for 1
the 1
prince 1
s 1
kingdom 1
which 1
they 1
reached 1
safely 1
and 1
there 1
they 1
lived 1
happily 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
years 1
CAT 1
AND 1
MOUSE 1
IN 1
PARTNERSHIP 1
A 1
certain 1
cat 1
had 1
made 1
the 1
acquaintance 1
of 1
a 1
mouse 1
and 1
had 1
said 1
so 1
much 1
to 1
her 1
about 1
the 1
great 1
love 1
and 1
friendship 1
she 1
felt 1
for 1
her 1
that 1
at 1
length 1
the 1
mouse 1
agreed 1
that 1
they 1
should 1
live 1
and 1
keep 1
house 1
together 1
But 1
we 1
must 1
make 1
a 1
provision 1
for 1
winter 1
or 1
else 1
we 1
shall 1
suffer 1
from 1
hunger 1
said 1
the 1
cat 1
and 1
you 1
little 1
mouse 1
cannot 1
venture 1
everywhere 1
or 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
caught 1
in 1
a 1
trap 1
some 1
day 1
The 1
good 1
advice 1
was 1
followed 1
and 1
a 1
pot 1
of 1
fat 1
was 1
bought 1
but 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
where 1
to 1
put 1
it 1
At 1
length 1
after 1
much 1
consideration 1
the 1
cat 1
said 1
I 1
know 1
no 1
place 1
where 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
better 1
stored 1
up 1
than 1
in 1
the 1
church 1
for 1
no 1
one 1
dares 1
take 1
anything 1
away 1
from 1
there 1
We 1
will 1
set 1
it 1
beneath 1
the 1
altar 1
and 1
not 1
touch 1
it 1
until 1
we 1
are 1
really 1
in 1
need 1
of 1
it 1
So 1
the 1
pot 1
was 1
placed 1
in 1
safety 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
the 1
cat 1
had 1
a 1
great 1
yearning 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
mouse 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
something 1
little 1
mouse 1
my 1
cousin 1
has 1
brought 1
a 1
little 1
son 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
has 1
asked 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
godmother 1
he 1
is 1
white 1
with 1
brown 1
spots 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
to 1
hold 1
him 1
over 1
the 1
font 1
at 1
the 1
christening 1
Let 1
me 1
go 1
out 1
today 1
and 1
you 1
look 1
after 1
the 1
house 1
by 1
yourself 1
Yes 1
yes 1
answered 1
the 1
mouse 1
by 1
all 1
means 1
go 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
get 1
anything 1
very 1
good 1
to 1
eat 1
think 1
of 1
me 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
a 1
drop 1
of 1
sweet 1
red 1
christening 1
wine 1
myself 1
All 1
this 1
however 1
was 1
untrue 1
the 1
cat 1
had 1
no 1
cousin 1
and 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
asked 1
to 1
be 1
godmother 1
She 1
went 1
straight 1
to 1
the 1
church 1
stole 1
to 1
the 1
pot 1
of 1
fat 1
began 1
to 1
lick 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
licked 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
fat 1
off 1
Then 1
she 1
took 1
a 1
walk 1
upon 1
the 1
roofs 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
looked 1
out 1
for 1
opportunities 1
and 1
then 1
stretched 1
herself 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
licked 1
her 1
lips 1
whenever 1
she 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
pot 1
of 1
fat 1
and 1
not 1
until 1
it 1
was 1
evening 1
did 1
she 1
return 1
home 1
Well 1
here 1
you 1
are 1
again 1
said 1
the 1
mouse 1
no 1
doubt 1
you 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
merry 1
day 1
All 1
went 1
off 1
well 1
answered 1
the 1
cat 1
What 1
name 1
did 1
they 1
give 1
the 1
child 1
Top 1
off 1
said 1
the 1
cat 1
quite 1
coolly 1
Top 1
off 1
cried 1
the 1
mouse 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
odd 1
and 1
uncommon 1
name 1
is 1
it 1
a 1
usual 1
one 1
in 1
your 1
family 1
What 1
does 1
that 1
matter 1
said 1
the 1
cat 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
worse 1
than 1
Crumb 1
stealer 1
as 1
your 1
godchildren 1
are 1
called 1
Before 1
long 1
the 1
cat 1
was 1
seized 1
by 1
another 1
fit 1
of 1
yearning 1
She 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
mouse 1
You 1
must 1
do 1
me 1
a 1
favour 1
and 1
once 1
more 1
manage 1
the 1
house 1
for 1
a 1
day 1
alone 1
I 1
am 1
again 1
asked 1
to 1
be 1
godmother 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
child 1
has 1
a 1
white 1
ring 1
round 1
its 1
neck 1
I 1
cannot 1
refuse 1
The 1
good 1
mouse 1
consented 1
but 1
the 1
cat 1
crept 1
behind 1
the 1
town 1
walls 1
to 1
the 1
church 1
and 1
devoured 1
half 1
the 1
pot 1
of 1
fat 1
Nothing 1
ever 1
seems 1
so 1
good 1
as 1
what 1
one 1
keeps 1
to 1
oneself 1
said 1
she 1
and 1
was 1
quite 1
satisfied 1
with 1
her 1
day 1
s 1
work 1
When 1
she 1
went 1
home 1
the 1
mouse 1
inquired 1
And 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
child 1
christened 1
Half 1
done 1
answered 1
the 1
cat 1
Half 1
done 1
What 1
are 1
you 1
saying 1
I 1
never 1
heard 1
the 1
name 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
I 1
ll 1
wager 1
anything 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
calendar 1
The 1
cat 1
s 1
mouth 1
soon 1
began 1
to 1
water 1
for 1
some 1
more 1
licking 1
All 1
good 1
things 1
go 1
in 1
threes 1
said 1
she 1
I 1
am 1
asked 1
to 1
stand 1
godmother 1
again 1
The 1
child 1
is 1
quite 1
black 1
only 1
it 1
has 1
white 1
paws 1
but 1
with 1
that 1
exception 1
it 1
has 1
not 1
a 1
single 1
white 1
hair 1
on 1
its 1
whole 1
body 1
this 1
only 1
happens 1
once 1
every 1
few 1
years 1
you 1
will 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
won 1
t 1
you 1
Top 1
off 1
Half 1
done 1
answered 1
the 1
mouse 1
they 1
are 1
such 1
odd 1
names 1
they 1
make 1
me 1
very 1
thoughtful 1
You 1
sit 1
at 1
home 1
said 1
the 1
cat 1
in 1
your 1
dark 1
grey 1
fur 1
coat 1
and 1
long 1
tail 1
and 1
are 1
filled 1
with 1
fancies 1
that 1
s 1
because 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
go 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
daytime 1
During 1
the 1
cat 1
s 1
absence 1
the 1
mouse 1
cleaned 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
in 1
order 1
but 1
the 1
greedy 1
cat 1
entirely 1
emptied 1
the 1
pot 1
of 1
fat 1
When 1
everything 1
is 1
eaten 1
up 1
one 1
has 1
some 1
peace 1
said 1
she 1
to 1
herself 1
and 1
well 1
filled 1
and 1
fat 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
return 1
home 1
till 1
night 1
The 1
mouse 1
at 1
once 1
asked 1
what 1
name 1
had 1
been 1
given 1
to 1
the 1
third 1
child 1
It 1
will 1
not 1
please 1
you 1
more 1
than 1
the 1
others 1
said 1
the 1
cat 1
He 1
is 1
called 1
All 1
gone 1
All 1
gone 1
cried 1
the 1
mouse 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
suspicious 1
name 1
of 1
all 1
I 1
have 1
never 1
seen 1
it 1
in 1
print 1
All 1
gone 1
what 1
can 1
that 1
mean 1
and 1
she 1
shook 1
her 1
head 1
curled 1
herself 1
up 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
to 1
sleep 1
From 1
this 1
time 1
forth 1
no 1
one 1
invited 1
the 1
cat 1
to 1
be 1
godmother 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
winter 1
had 1
come 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
longer 1
anything 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
outside 1
the 1
mouse 1
thought 1
of 1
their 1
provision 1
and 1
said 1
Come 1
cat 1
we 1
will 1
go 1
to 1
our 1
pot 1
of 1
fat 1
which 1
we 1
have 1
stored 1
up 1
for 1
ourselves 1
we 1
shall 1
enjoy 1
that 1
Yes 1
answered 1
the 1
cat 1
you 1
will 1
enjoy 1
it 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
you 1
would 1
enjoy 1
sticking 1
that 1
dainty 1
tongue 1
of 1
yours 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
They 1
set 1
out 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
but 1
when 1
they 1
arrived 1
the 1
pot 1
of 1
fat 1
certainly 1
was 1
still 1
in 1
its 1
place 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
empty 1
Alas 1
said 1
the 1
mouse 1
now 1
I 1
see 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
now 1
it 1
comes 1
to 1
light 1
You 1
are 1
a 1
true 1
friend 1
You 1
have 1
devoured 1
all 1
when 1
you 1
were 1
standing 1
godmother 1
First 1
top 1
off 1
then 1
half 1
done 1
then 1
Will 1
you 1
hold 1
your 1
tongue 1
cried 1
the 1
cat 1
one 1
word 1
more 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
eat 1
you 1
too 1
All 1
gone 1
was 1
already 1
on 1
the 1
poor 1
mouse 1
s 1
lips 1
scarcely 1
had 1
she 1
spoken 1
it 1
before 1
the 1
cat 1
sprang 1
on 1
her 1
seized 1
her 1
and 1
swallowed 1
her 1
down 1
Verily 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
THE 1
GOOSE 1
GIRL 1
The 1
king 1
of 1
a 1
great 1
land 1
died 1
and 1
left 1
his 1
queen 1
to 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
their 1
only 1
child 1
This 1
child 1
was 1
a 1
daughter 1
who 1
was 1
very 1
beautiful 1
and 1
her 1
mother 1
loved 1
her 1
dearly 1
and 1
was 1
very 1
kind 1
to 1
her 1
And 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
fairy 1
too 1
who 1
was 1
fond 1
of 1
the 1
princess 1
and 1
helped 1
her 1
mother 1
to 1
watch 1
over 1
her 1
When 1
she 1
grew 1
up 1
she 1
was 1
betrothed 1
to 1
a 1
prince 1
who 1
lived 1
a 1
great 1
way 1
off 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
time 1
drew 1
near 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
she 1
got 1
ready 1
to 1
set 1
off 1
on 1
her 1
journey 1
to 1
his 1
country 1
Then 1
the 1
queen 1
her 1
mother 1
packed 1
up 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
costly 1
things 1
jewels 1
and 1
gold 1
and 1
silver 1
trinkets 1
fine 1
dresses 1
and 1
in 1
short 1
everything 1
that 1
became 1
a 1
royal 1
bride 1
And 1
she 1
gave 1
her 1
a 1
waiting 1
maid 1
to 1
ride 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
give 1
her 1
into 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
s 1
hands 1
and 1
each 1
had 1
a 1
horse 1
for 1
the 1
journey 1
Now 1
the 1
princess 1
s 1
horse 1
was 1
the 1
fairy 1
s 1
gift 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
called 1
Falada 1
and 1
could 1
speak 1
When 1
the 1
time 1
came 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
set 1
out 1
the 1
fairy 1
went 1
into 1
her 1
bed 1
chamber 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
little 1
knife 1
and 1
cut 1
off 1
a 1
lock 1
of 1
her 1
hair 1
and 1
gave 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
princess 1
and 1
said 1
Take 1
care 1
of 1
it 1
dear 1
child 1
for 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
charm 1
that 1
may 1
be 1
of 1
use 1
to 1
you 1
on 1
the 1
road 1
Then 1
they 1
all 1
took 1
a 1
sorrowful 1
leave 1
of 1
the 1
princess 1
and 1
she 1
put 1
the 1
lock 1
of 1
hair 1
into 1
her 1
bosom 1
got 1
upon 1
her 1
horse 1
and 1
set 1
off 1
on 1
her 1
journey 1
to 1
her 1
bridegroom 1
s 1
kingdom 1
One 1
day 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
riding 1
along 1
by 1
a 1
brook 1
the 1
princess 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
very 1
thirsty 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
maid 1
Pray 1
get 1
down 1
and 1
fetch 1
me 1
some 1
water 1
in 1
my 1
golden 1
cup 1
out 1
of 1
yonder 1
brook 1
for 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
drink 1
Nay 1
said 1
the 1
maid 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
thirsty 1
get 1
off 1
yourself 1
and 1
stoop 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
drink 1
I 1
shall 1
not 1
be 1
your 1
waiting 1
maid 1
any 1
longer 1
Then 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
thirsty 1
that 1
she 1
got 1
down 1
and 1
knelt 1
over 1
the 1
little 1
brook 1
and 1
drank 1
for 1
she 1
was 1
frightened 1
and 1
dared 1
not 1
bring 1
out 1
her 1
golden 1
cup 1
and 1
she 1
wept 1
and 1
said 1
Alas 1
what 1
will 1
become 1
of 1
me 1
And 1
the 1
lock 1
answered 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
Alas 1
alas 1
if 1
thy 1
mother 1
knew 1
it 1
Sadly 1
sadly 1
would 1
she 1
rue 1
it 1
But 1
the 1
princess 1
was 1
very 1
gentle 1
and 1
meek 1
so 1
she 1
said 1
nothing 1
to 1
her 1
maid 1
s 1
ill 1
behaviour 1
but 1
got 1
upon 1
her 1
horse 1
again 1
Then 1
all 1
rode 1
farther 1
on 1
their 1
journey 1
till 1
the 1
day 1
grew 1
so 1
warm 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
so 1
scorching 1
that 1
the 1
bride 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
very 1
thirsty 1
again 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
river 1
she 1
forgot 1
her 1
maid 1
s 1
rude 1
speech 1
and 1
said 1
Pray 1
get 1
down 1
and 1
fetch 1
me 1
some 1
water 1
to 1
drink 1
in 1
my 1
golden 1
cup 1
But 1
the 1
maid 1
answered 1
her 1
and 1
even 1
spoke 1
more 1
haughtily 1
than 1
before 1
Drink 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
but 1
I 1
shall 1
not 1
be 1
your 1
waiting 1
maid 1
Then 1
the 1
princess 1
was 1
so 1
thirsty 1
that 1
she 1
got 1
off 1
her 1
horse 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
and 1
held 1
her 1
head 1
over 1
the 1
running 1
stream 1
and 1
cried 1
and 1
said 1
What 1
will 1
become 1
of 1
me 1
And 1
the 1
lock 1
of 1
hair 1
answered 1
her 1
again 1
Alas 1
alas 1
if 1
thy 1
mother 1
knew 1
it 1
Sadly 1
sadly 1
would 1
she 1
rue 1
it 1
And 1
as 1
she 1
leaned 1
down 1
to 1
drink 1
the 1
lock 1
of 1
hair 1
fell 1
from 1
her 1
bosom 1
and 1
floated 1
away 1
with 1
the 1
water 1
Now 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
frightened 1
that 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
see 1
it 1
but 1
her 1
maid 1
saw 1
it 1
and 1
was 1
very 1
glad 1
for 1
she 1
knew 1
the 1
charm 1
and 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
poor 1
bride 1
would 1
be 1
in 1
her 1
power 1
now 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
lost 1
the 1
hair 1
So 1
when 1
the 1
bride 1
had 1
done 1
drinking 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
got 1
upon 1
Falada 1
again 1
the 1
maid 1
said 1
I 1
shall 1
ride 1
upon 1
Falada 1
and 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
my 1
horse 1
instead 1
so 1
she 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
give 1
up 1
her 1
horse 1
and 1
soon 1
afterwards 1
to 1
take 1
off 1
her 1
royal 1
clothes 1
and 1
put 1
on 1
her 1
maid 1
s 1
shabby 1
ones 1
At 1
last 1
as 1
they 1
drew 1
near 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
their 1
journey 1
this 1
treacherous 1
servant 1
threatened 1
to 1
kill 1
her 1
mistress 1
if 1
she 1
ever 1
told 1
anyone 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
But 1
Falada 1
saw 1
it 1
all 1
and 1
marked 1
it 1
well 1
Then 1
the 1
waiting 1
maid 1
got 1
upon 1
Falada 1
and 1
the 1
real 1
bride 1
rode 1
upon 1
the 1
other 1
horse 1
and 1
they 1
went 1
on 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
royal 1
court 1
There 1
was 1
great 1
joy 1
at 1
their 1
coming 1
and 1
the 1
prince 1
flew 1
to 1
meet 1
them 1
and 1
lifted 1
the 1
maid 1
from 1
her 1
horse 1
thinking 1
she 1
was 1
the 1
one 1
who 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
led 1
upstairs 1
to 1
the 1
royal 1
chamber 1
but 1
the 1
true 1
princess 1
was 1
told 1
to 1
stay 1
in 1
the 1
court 1
below 1
Now 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
happened 1
just 1
then 1
to 1
have 1
nothing 1
else 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
he 1
amused 1
himself 1
by 1
sitting 1
at 1
his 1
kitchen 1
window 1
looking 1
at 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
and 1
he 1
saw 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
courtyard 1
As 1
she 1
looked 1
very 1
pretty 1
and 1
too 1
delicate 1
for 1
a 1
waiting 1
maid 1
he 1
went 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
royal 1
chamber 1
to 1
ask 1
the 1
bride 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
she 1
had 1
brought 1
with 1
her 1
that 1
was 1
thus 1
left 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
court 1
below 1
I 1
brought 1
her 1
with 1
me 1
for 1
the 1
sake 1
of 1
her 1
company 1
on 1
the 1
road 1
said 1
she 1
pray 1
give 1
the 1
girl 1
some 1
work 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
she 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
idle 1
The 1
old 1
king 1
could 1
not 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
think 1
of 1
any 1
work 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
said 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
lad 1
who 1
takes 1
care 1
of 1
my 1
geese 1
she 1
may 1
go 1
and 1
help 1
him 1
Now 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
this 1
lad 1
that 1
the 1
real 1
bride 1
was 1
to 1
help 1
in 1
watching 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
geese 1
was 1
Curdken 1
But 1
the 1
false 1
bride 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
prince 1
Dear 1
husband 1
pray 1
do 1
me 1
one 1
piece 1
of 1
kindness 1
That 1
I 1
will 1
said 1
the 1
prince 1
Then 1
tell 1
one 1
of 1
your 1
slaughterers 1
to 1
cut 1
off 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
horse 1
I 1
rode 1
upon 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
unruly 1
and 1
plagued 1
me 1
sadly 1
on 1
the 1
road 1
but 1
the 1
truth 1
was 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
much 1
afraid 1
lest 1
Falada 1
should 1
some 1
day 1
or 1
other 1
speak 1
and 1
tell 1
all 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
to 1
the 1
princess 1
She 1
carried 1
her 1
point 1
and 1
the 1
faithful 1
Falada 1
was 1
killed 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
true 1
princess 1
heard 1
of 1
it 1
she 1
wept 1
and 1
begged 1
the 1
man 1
to 1
nail 1
up 1
Falada 1
s 1
head 1
against 1
a 1
large 1
dark 1
gate 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
through 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
pass 1
every 1
morning 1
and 1
evening 1
that 1
there 1
she 1
might 1
still 1
see 1
him 1
sometimes 1
Then 1
the 1
slaughterer 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
do 1
as 1
she 1
wished 1
and 1
cut 1
off 1
the 1
head 1
and 1
nailed 1
it 1
up 1
under 1
the 1
dark 1
gate 1
Early 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
as 1
she 1
and 1
Curdken 1
went 1
out 1
through 1
the 1
gate 1
she 1
said 1
sorrowfully 1
Falada 2
there 1
thou 1
hangest 1
and 1
the 1
head 1
answered 1
Bride 1
bride 1
there 1
thou 1
gangest 1
Alas 1
alas 1
if 1
thy 1
mother 1
knew 1
it 1
Sadly 1
sadly 1
would 1
she 1
rue 1
it 1
Then 1
they 1
went 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
and 1
drove 1
the 1
geese 1
on 1
And 1
when 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
meadow 1
she 1
sat 1
down 1
upon 1
a 1
bank 1
there 1
and 1
let 1
down 1
her 1
waving 1
locks 1
of 1
hair 1
which 1
were 1
all 1
of 1
pure 1
silver 1
and 1
when 1
Curdken 1
saw 1
it 1
glitter 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
he 1
ran 1
up 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
pulled 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
locks 1
out 1
but 1
she 1
cried 1
Blow 1
breezes 1
blow 1
Let 1
Curdken 1
s 1
hat 1
go 1
Blow 1
breezes 1
blow 1
Let 1
him 1
after 1
it 1
go 1
O 1
er 1
hills 1
dales 1
and 1
rocks 1
Away 1
be 1
it 1
whirl 1
d 1
Till 1
the 1
silvery 1
locks 1
Are 1
all 1
comb 1
d 1
and 1
curl 1
d 1
Then 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
wind 1
so 1
strong 1
that 1
it 1
blew 1
off 1
Curdken 1
s 1
hat 1
and 1
away 1
it 1
flew 1
over 1
the 1
hills 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
turn 1
and 1
run 1
after 1
it 1
till 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
combing 1
and 1
curling 1
her 1
hair 1
and 1
had 1
put 1
it 1
up 1
again 1
safe 1
Then 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
angry 1
and 1
sulky 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
speak 1
to 1
her 1
at 1
all 1
but 1
they 1
watched 1
the 1
geese 1
until 1
it 1
grew 1
dark 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
and 1
then 1
drove 1
them 1
homewards 1
The 1
next 1
morning 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
going 1
through 1
the 1
dark 1
gate 1
the 1
poor 1
girl 1
looked 1
up 1
at 1
Falada 1
s 1
head 1
and 1
cried 1
Falada 2
there 1
thou 1
hangest 1
and 1
the 1
head 1
answered 1
Bride 1
bride 1
there 1
thou 1
gangest 1
Alas 1
alas 1
if 1
thy 1
mother 1
knew 1
it 1
Sadly 1
sadly 1
would 1
she 1
rue 1
it 1
Then 1
she 1
drove 1
on 1
the 1
geese 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
again 1
in 1
the 1
meadow 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
comb 1
out 1
her 1
hair 1
as 1
before 1
and 1
Curdken 1
ran 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
take 1
hold 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
she 1
cried 1
out 1
quickly 1
Blow 1
breezes 1
blow 1
Let 1
Curdken 1
s 1
hat 1
go 1
Blow 1
breezes 1
blow 1
Let 1
him 1
after 1
it 1
go 1
O 1
er 1
hills 1
dales 1
and 1
rocks 1
Away 1
be 1
it 1
whirl 1
d 1
Till 1
the 1
silvery 1
locks 1
Are 1
all 1
comb 1
d 1
and 1
curl 1
d 1
Then 1
the 1
wind 1
came 1
and 1
blew 1
away 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
off 1
it 1
flew 1
a 1
great 1
way 1
over 1
the 1
hills 1
and 1
far 1
away 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
run 1
after 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
she 1
had 1
bound 1
up 1
her 1
hair 1
again 1
and 1
all 1
was 1
safe 1
So 1
they 1
watched 1
the 1
geese 1
till 1
it 1
grew 1
dark 1
In 1
the 1
evening 1
after 1
they 1
came 1
home 1
Curdken 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
cannot 1
have 1
that 1
strange 1
girl 1
to 1
help 1
me 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
geese 1
any 1
longer 1
Why 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
Because 1
instead 1
of 1
doing 1
any 1
good 1
she 1
does 1
nothing 1
but 1
tease 1
me 1
all 1
day 1
long 1
Then 1
the 1
king 1
made 1
him 1
tell 1
him 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
And 1
Curdken 1
said 1
When 1
we 1
go 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
through 1
the 1
dark 1
gate 1
with 1
our 1
flock 1
of 1
geese 1
she 1
cries 1
and 1
talks 1
with 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
a 1
horse 1
that 1
hangs 1
upon 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
says 1
Falada 2
there 1
thou 1
hangest 1
and 1
the 1
head 1
answers 1
Bride 1
bride 1
there 1
thou 1
gangest 1
Alas 1
alas 1
if 1
thy 1
mother 1
knew 1
it 1
Sadly 1
sadly 1
would 1
she 1
rue 1
it 1
And 1
Curdken 1
went 1
on 1
telling 1
the 1
king 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
upon 1
the 1
meadow 1
where 1
the 1
geese 1
fed 1
how 1
his 1
hat 1
was 1
blown 1
away 1
and 1
how 1
he 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
run 1
after 1
it 1
and 1
to 1
leave 1
his 1
flock 1
of 1
geese 1
to 1
themselves 1
But 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
told 1
the 1
boy 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
again 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
and 1
when 1
morning 1
came 1
he 1
placed 1
himself 1
behind 1
the 1
dark 1
gate 1
and 1
heard 1
how 1
she 1
spoke 1
to 1
Falada 1
and 1
how 1
Falada 1
answered 1
Then 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
field 1
and 1
hid 1
himself 1
in 1
a 1
bush 1
by 1
the 1
meadow 1
s 1
side 1
and 1
he 1
soon 1
saw 1
with 1
his 1
own 1
eyes 1
how 1
they 1
drove 1
the 1
flock 1
of 1
geese 1
and 1
how 1
after 1
a 1
little 1
time 1
she 1
let 1
down 1
her 1
hair 1
that 1
glittered 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
And 1
then 1
he 1
heard 1
her 1
say 1
Blow 1
breezes 1
blow 1
Let 1
Curdken 1
s 1
hat 1
go 1
Blow 1
breezes 1
blow 1
Let 1
him 1
after 1
it 1
go 1
O 1
er 1
hills 1
dales 1
and 1
rocks 1
Away 1
be 1
it 1
whirl 1
d 1
Till 1
the 1
silvery 1
locks 1
Are 1
all 1
comb 1
d 1
and 1
curl 1
d 1
And 1
soon 1
came 1
a 1
gale 1
of 1
wind 1
and 1
carried 1
away 1
Curdken 1
s 1
hat 1
and 1
away 1
went 1
Curdken 1
after 1
it 1
while 1
the 1
girl 1
went 1
on 1
combing 1
and 1
curling 1
her 1
hair 1
All 1
this 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
saw 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
home 1
without 1
being 1
seen 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
little 1
goose 1
girl 1
came 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
he 1
called 1
her 1
aside 1
and 1
asked 1
her 1
why 1
she 1
did 1
so 1
but 1
she 1
burst 1
into 1
tears 1
and 1
said 1
That 1
I 1
must 1
not 1
tell 1
you 1
or 1
any 1
man 1
or 1
I 1
shall 1
lose 1
my 1
life 1
But 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
begged 1
so 1
hard 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
peace 1
till 1
she 1
had 1
told 1
him 1
all 1
the 1
tale 1
from 1
beginning 1
to 1
end 1
word 1
for 1
word 1
And 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
lucky 1
for 1
her 1
that 1
she 1
did 1
so 1
for 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
the 1
king 1
ordered 1
royal 1
clothes 1
to 1
be 1
put 1
upon 1
her 1
and 1
gazed 1
on 1
her 1
with 1
wonder 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
beautiful 1
Then 1
he 1
called 1
his 1
son 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
only 1
a 1
false 1
bride 1
for 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
merely 1
a 1
waiting 1
maid 1
while 1
the 1
true 1
bride 1
stood 1
by 1
And 1
the 1
young 1
king 1
rejoiced 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
her 1
beauty 1
and 1
heard 1
how 1
meek 1
and 1
patient 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
and 1
without 1
saying 1
anything 1
to 1
the 1
false 1
bride 1
the 1
king 1
ordered 1
a 1
great 1
feast 1
to 1
be 1
got 1
ready 1
for 1
all 1
his 1
court 1
The 1
bridegroom 1
sat 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
with 1
the 1
false 1
princess 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
the 1
true 1
one 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
but 1
nobody 1
knew 1
her 1
again 1
for 1
her 1
beauty 1
was 1
quite 1
dazzling 1
to 1
their 1
eyes 1
and 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
seem 1
at 1
all 1
like 1
the 1
little 1
goose 1
girl 1
now 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
her 1
brilliant 1
dress 1
on 1
When 1
they 1
had 1
eaten 1
and 1
drank 1
and 1
were 1
very 1
merry 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
tell 1
them 1
a 1
tale 1
So 1
he 1
began 1
and 1
told 1
all 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
the 1
princess 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
one 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
once 1
heard 1
and 1
he 1
asked 1
the 1
true 1
waiting 1
maid 1
what 1
she 1
thought 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
to 1
anyone 1
who 1
would 1
behave 1
thus 1
Nothing 1
better 1
said 1
this 1
false 1
bride 1
than 1
that 1
she 1
should 1
be 1
thrown 1
into 1
a 1
cask 1
stuck 1
round 1
with 1
sharp 1
nails 1
and 1
that 1
two 1
white 1
horses 1
should 1
be 1
put 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
should 1
drag 1
it 1
from 1
street 1
to 1
street 1
till 1
she 1
was 1
dead 1
Thou 1
art 1
she 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
and 1
as 1
thou 1
has 1
judged 1
thyself 1
so 1
shall 1
it 1
be 1
done 1
to 1
thee 1
And 1
the 1
young 1
king 1
was 1
then 1
married 1
to 1
his 1
true 1
wife 1
and 1
they 1
reigned 1
over 1
the 1
kingdom 1
in 1
peace 1
and 1
happiness 1
all 1
their 1
lives 1
and 1
the 1
good 1
fairy 1
came 1
to 1
see 1
them 1
and 1
restored 1
the 1
faithful 1
Falada 1
to 1
life 1
again 1
THE 1
ADVENTURES 1
OF 1
CHANTICLEER 1
AND 1
PARTLET 1
HOW 1
THEY 1
WENT 1
TO 1
THE 1
MOUNTAINS 1
TO 1
EAT 1
NUTS 1
The 1
nuts 1
are 1
quite 1
ripe 1
now 1
said 1
Chanticleer 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1
Partlet 1
suppose 1
we 1
go 1
together 1
to 1
the 1
mountains 1
and 1
eat 1
as 1
many 1
as 1
we 1
can 1
before 1
the 1
squirrel 1
takes 1
them 1
all 1
away 1
With 1
all 1
my 1
heart 1
said 1
Partlet 1
let 1
us 1
go 1
and 1
make 1
a 1
holiday 1
of 1
it 1
together 1
So 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
mountains 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
lovely 1
day 1
they 1
stayed 1
there 1
till 1
the 1
evening 1
Now 1
whether 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
eaten 1
so 1
many 1
nuts 1
that 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
walk 1
or 1
whether 1
they 1
were 1
lazy 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
however 1
they 1
took 1
it 1
into 1
their 1
heads 1
that 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
become 1
them 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
on 1
foot 1
So 1
Chanticleer 1
began 1
to 1
build 1
a 1
little 1
carriage 1
of 1
nutshells 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
finished 1
Partlet 1
jumped 1
into 1
it 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
bid 1
Chanticleer 1
harness 1
himself 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
draw 1
her 1
home 1
That 1
s 1
a 1
good 1
joke 1
said 1
Chanticleer 1
no 1
that 1
will 1
never 1
do 1
I 1
had 1
rather 1
by 1
half 1
walk 1
home 1
I 1
ll 1
sit 1
on 1
the 1
box 1
and 1
be 1
coachman 1
if 1
you 1
like 1
but 1
I 1
ll 1
not 1
draw 1
While 1
this 1
was 1
passing 1
a 1
duck 1
came 1
quacking 1
up 1
and 1
cried 1
out 1
You 1
thieving 1
vagabonds 1
what 1
business 1
have 1
you 1
in 1
my 1
grounds 1
I 1
ll 1
give 1
it 1
you 1
well 1
for 1
your 1
insolence 1
and 1
upon 1
that 1
she 1
fell 1
upon 1
Chanticleer 1
most 1
lustily 1
But 1
Chanticleer 1
was 1
no 1
coward 1
and 1
returned 1
the 1
duck 1
s 1
blows 1
with 1
his 1
sharp 1
spurs 1
so 1
fiercely 1
that 1
she 1
soon 1
began 1
to 1
cry 1
out 1
for 1
mercy 1
which 1
was 1
only 1
granted 1
her 1
upon 1
condition 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
draw 1
the 1
carriage 1
home 1
for 1
them 1
This 1
she 1
agreed 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
Chanticleer 1
got 1
upon 1
the 1
box 1
and 1
drove 1
crying 1
Now 1
duck 1
get 1
on 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
And 1
away 1
they 1
went 1
at 1
a 1
pretty 1
good 1
pace 1
After 1
they 1
had 1
travelled 1
along 1
a 1
little 1
way 1
they 1
met 1
a 1
needle 1
and 1
a 1
pin 1
walking 1
together 1
along 1
the 1
road 1
and 1
the 1
needle 1
cried 1
out 1
Stop 1
stop 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
dark 1
that 1
they 1
could 1
hardly 1
find 1
their 1
way 1
and 1
such 1
dirty 1
walking 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
get 1
on 1
at 1
all 1
he 1
told 1
them 1
that 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
friend 1
the 1
pin 1
had 1
been 1
at 1
a 1
public 1
house 1
a 1
few 1
miles 1
off 1
and 1
had 1
sat 1
drinking 1
till 1
they 1
had 1
forgotten 1
how 1
late 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
begged 1
therefore 1
that 1
the 1
travellers 1
would 1
be 1
so 1
kind 1
as 1
to 1
give 1
them 1
a 1
lift 1
in 1
their 1
carriage 1
Chanticleer 1
observing 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
but 1
thin 1
fellows 1
and 1
not 1
likely 1
to 1
take 1
up 1
much 1
room 1
told 1
them 1
they 1
might 1
ride 1
but 1
made 1
them 1
promise 1
not 1
to 1
dirty 1
the 1
wheels 1
of 1
the 1
carriage 1
in 1
getting 1
in 1
nor 1
to 1
tread 1
on 1
Partlet 1
s 1
toes 1
Late 1
at 1
night 1
they 1
arrived 1
at 1
an 1
inn 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
bad 1
travelling 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
and 1
the 1
duck 1
seemed 1
much 1
tired 1
and 1
waddled 1
about 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
from 1
one 1
side 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
they 1
made 1
up 1
their 1
minds 1
to 1
fix 1
their 1
quarters 1
there 1
but 1
the 1
landlord 1
at 1
first 1
was 1
unwilling 1
and 1
said 1
his 1
house 1
was 1
full 1
thinking 1
they 1
might 1
not 1
be 1
very 1
respectable 1
company 1
however 1
they 1
spoke 1
civilly 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
egg 1
which 1
Partlet 1
had 1
laid 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
and 1
said 1
they 1
would 1
give 1
him 1
the 1
duck 1
who 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
laying 1
one 1
every 1
day 1
so 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
let 1
them 1
come 1
in 1
and 1
they 1
bespoke 1
a 1
handsome 1
supper 1
and 1
spent 1
the 1
evening 1
very 1
jollily 1
Early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
before 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
light 1
and 1
when 1
nobody 1
was 1
stirring 1
in 1
the 1
inn 1
Chanticleer 1
awakened 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
fetching 1
the 1
egg 1
they 1
pecked 1
a 1
hole 1
in 1
it 1
ate 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
threw 1
the 1
shells 1
into 1
the 1
fireplace 1
they 1
then 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
pin 1
and 1
needle 1
who 1
were 1
fast 1
asleep 1
and 1
seizing 1
them 1
by 1
the 1
heads 1
stuck 1
one 1
into 1
the 1
landlord 1
s 1
easy 1
chair 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
into 1
his 1
handkerchief 1
and 1
having 1
done 1
this 1
they 1
crept 1
away 1
as 1
softly 1
as 1
possible 1
However 1
the 1
duck 1
who 1
slept 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
air 1
in 1
the 1
yard 1
heard 1
them 1
coming 1
and 1
jumping 1
into 1
the 1
brook 1
which 1
ran 1
close 1
by 1
the 1
inn 1
soon 1
swam 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
reach 1
An 1
hour 1
or 1
two 1
afterwards 1
the 1
landlord 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
took 1
his 1
handkerchief 1
to 1
wipe 1
his 1
face 1
but 1
the 1
pin 1
ran 1
into 1
him 1
and 1
pricked 1
him 1
then 1
he 1
walked 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
to 1
light 1
his 1
pipe 1
at 1
the 1
fire 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
stirred 1
it 1
up 1
the 1
eggshells 1
flew 1
into 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
almost 1
blinded 1
him 1
Bless 1
me 1
said 1
he 1
all 1
the 1
world 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
design 1
against 1
my 1
head 1
this 1
morning 1
and 1
so 1
saying 1
he 1
threw 1
himself 1
sulkily 1
into 1
his 1
easy 1
chair 1
but 1
oh 1
dear 1
the 1
needle 1
ran 1
into 1
him 1
and 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
pain 1
was 1
not 1
in 1
his 1
head 1
He 1
now 1
flew 1
into 1
a 1
very 1
great 1
passion 1
and 1
suspecting 1
the 1
company 1
who 1
had 1
come 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
look 1
after 1
them 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
off 1
so 1
he 1
swore 1
that 1
he 1
never 1
again 1
would 1
take 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
troop 1
of 1
vagabonds 1
who 1
ate 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
paid 1
no 1
reckoning 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
nothing 1
for 1
his 1
trouble 1
but 1
their 1
apish 1
tricks 1
HOW 1
CHANTICLEER 1
AND 1
PARTLET 1
WENT 1
TO 1
VISIT 1
MR 1
KORBES 1
Another 1
day 1
Chanticleer 1
and 1
Partlet 1
wished 1
to 1
ride 1
out 1
together 1
so 1
Chanticleer 1
built 1
a 1
handsome 1
carriage 1
with 1
four 1
red 1
wheels 1
and 1
harnessed 1
six 1
mice 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
and 1
Partlet 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
carriage 1
and 1
away 1
they 1
drove 1
Soon 1
afterwards 1
a 1
cat 1
met 1
them 1
and 1
said 1
Where 1
are 1
you 1
going 1
And 1
Chanticleer 1
replied 1
All 1
on 1
our 1
way 1
A 1
visit 1
to 1
pay 1
To 1
Mr 1
Korbes 1
the 1
fox 1
today 1
Then 1
the 1
cat 1
said 1
Take 1
me 1
with 1
you 1
Chanticleer 1
said 1
With 1
all 1
my 1
heart 1
get 1
up 1
behind 1
and 1
be 1
sure 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
fall 1
off 1
Take 1
care 1
of 1
this 1
handsome 1
coach 1
of 1
mine 1
Nor 1
dirty 1
my 1
pretty 1
red 1
wheels 1
so 1
fine 1
Now 1
mice 1
be 1
ready 1
And 1
wheels 1
run 1
steady 1
For 1
we 1
are 1
going 1
a 1
visit 1
to 1
pay 1
To 1
Mr 1
Korbes 1
the 1
fox 1
today 1
Soon 1
after 1
came 1
up 1
a 1
millstone 1
an 1
egg 1
a 1
duck 1
and 1
a 1
pin 1
and 1
Chanticleer 1
gave 1
them 1
all 1
leave 1
to 1
get 1
into 1
the 1
carriage 1
and 1
go 1
with 1
them 1
When 1
they 1
arrived 1
at 1
Mr 1
Korbes 1
s 1
house 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
at 1
home 1
so 1
the 1
mice 1
drew 1
the 1
carriage 1
into 1
the 1
coach 1
house 1
Chanticleer 1
and 1
Partlet 1
flew 1
upon 1
a 1
beam 1
the 1
cat 1
sat 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
fireplace 1
the 1
duck 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
washing 1
cistern 1
the 1
pin 1
stuck 1
himself 1
into 1
the 1
bed 1
pillow 1
the 1
millstone 1
laid 1
himself 1
over 1
the 1
house 1
door 1
and 1
the 1
egg 1
rolled 1
himself 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
towel 1
When 1
Mr 1
Korbes 1
came 1
home 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
fireplace 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
fire 1
but 1
the 1
cat 1
threw 1
all 1
the 1
ashes 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
so 1
he 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
kitchen 1
to 1
wash 1
himself 1
but 1
there 1
the 1
duck 1
splashed 1
all 1
the 1
water 1
in 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
wipe 1
himself 1
the 1
egg 1
broke 1
to 1
pieces 1
in 1
the 1
towel 1
all 1
over 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
eyes 1
Then 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
angry 1
and 1
went 1
without 1
his 1
supper 1
to 1
bed 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
laid 1
his 1
head 1
on 1
the 1
pillow 1
the 1
pin 1
ran 1
into 1
his 1
cheek 1
at 1
this 1
he 1
became 1
quite 1
furious 1
and 1
jumping 1
up 1
would 1
have 1
run 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
the 1
millstone 1
fell 1
down 1
on 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
killed 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
spot 1
HOW 1
PARTLET 1
DIED 1
AND 1
WAS 1
BURIED 1
AND 1
HOW 1
CHANTICLEER 1
DIED 1
OF 1
GRIEF 1
Another 1
day 1
Chanticleer 1
and 1
Partlet 1
agreed 1
to 1
go 1
again 1
to 1
the 1
mountains 1
to 1
eat 1
nuts 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
settled 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
nuts 1
which 1
they 1
found 1
should 1
be 1
shared 1
equally 1
between 1
them 1
Now 1
Partlet 1
found 1
a 1
very 1
large 1
nut 1
but 1
she 1
said 1
nothing 1
about 1
it 1
to 1
Chanticleer 1
and 1
kept 1
it 1
all 1
to 1
herself 1
however 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
big 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
swallow 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
stuck 1
in 1
her 1
throat 1
Then 1
she 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
great 1
fright 1
and 1
cried 1
out 1
to 1
Chanticleer 1
Pray 1
run 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
and 1
fetch 1
me 1
some 1
water 1
or 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
choked 1
Chanticleer 1
ran 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
to 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
said 1
River 1
give 1
me 1
some 1
water 1
for 1
Partlet 1
lies 1
in 1
the 1
mountain 1
and 1
will 1
be 1
choked 1
by 1
a 1
great 1
nut 1
The 1
river 1
said 1
Run 1
first 1
to 1
the 1
bride 1
and 1
ask 1
her 1
for 1
a 1
silken 1
cord 1
to 1
draw 1
up 1
the 1
water 1
Chanticleer 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
bride 1
and 1
said 1
Bride 1
you 1
must 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
silken 1
cord 1
for 1
then 1
the 1
river 1
will 1
give 1
me 1
water 1
and 1
the 1
water 1
I 1
will 1
carry 1
to 1
Partlet 1
who 1
lies 1
on 1
the 1
mountain 1
and 1
will 1
be 1
choked 1
by 1
a 1
great 1
nut 1
But 1
the 1
bride 1
said 1
Run 1
first 1
and 1
bring 1
me 1
my 1
garland 1
that 1
is 1
hanging 1
on 1
a 1
willow 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
Then 1
Chanticleer 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
garland 1
from 1
the 1
bough 1
where 1
it 1
hung 1
and 1
brought 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
bride 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
bride 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
silken 1
cord 1
and 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
silken 1
cord 1
to 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
the 1
river 1
gave 1
him 1
water 1
and 1
he 1
carried 1
the 1
water 1
to 1
Partlet 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
she 1
was 1
choked 1
by 1
the 1
great 1
nut 1
and 1
lay 1
quite 1
dead 1
and 1
never 1
moved 1
any 1
more 1
Then 1
Chanticleer 1
was 1
very 1
sorry 1
and 1
cried 1
bitterly 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
beasts 1
came 1
and 1
wept 1
with 1
him 1
over 1
poor 1
Partlet 1
And 1
six 1
mice 1
built 1
a 1
little 1
hearse 1
to 1
carry 1
her 1
to 1
her 1
grave 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
ready 1
they 1
harnessed 1
themselves 1
before 1
it 1
and 1
Chanticleer 1
drove 1
them 1
On 1
the 1
way 1
they 1
met 1
the 1
fox 1
Where 1
are 1
you 1
going 1
Chanticleer 1
said 1
he 1
To 1
bury 1
my 1
Partlet 1
said 1
the 1
other 1
May 1
I 1
go 1
with 1
you 1
said 1
the 1
fox 1
Yes 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
get 1
up 1
behind 1
or 1
my 1
horses 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
draw 1
you 1
Then 1
the 1
fox 1
got 1
up 1
behind 1
and 1
presently 1
the 1
wolf 1
the 1
bear 1
the 1
goat 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
beasts 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
came 1
and 1
climbed 1
upon 1
the 1
hearse 1
So 1
on 1
they 1
went 1
till 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
rapid 1
stream 1
How 1
shall 1
we 1
get 1
over 1
said 1
Chanticleer 1
Then 1
said 1
a 1
straw 1
I 1
will 1
lay 1
myself 1
across 1
and 1
you 1
may 1
pass 1
over 1
upon 1
me 1
But 1
as 1
the 1
mice 1
were 1
going 1
over 1
the 1
straw 1
slipped 1
away 1
and 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
the 1
six 1
mice 1
all 1
fell 1
in 1
and 1
were 1
drowned 1
What 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
Then 1
a 1
large 1
log 1
of 1
wood 1
came 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
am 1
big 1
enough 1
I 1
will 1
lay 1
myself 1
across 1
the 1
stream 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
pass 1
over 1
upon 1
me 1
So 1
he 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
but 1
they 1
managed 1
so 1
clumsily 1
that 1
the 1
log 1
of 1
wood 1
fell 1
in 1
and 1
was 1
carried 1
away 1
by 1
the 1
stream 1
Then 1
a 1
stone 1
who 1
saw 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
came 1
up 1
and 1
kindly 1
offered 1
to 1
help 1
poor 1
Chanticleer 1
by 1
laying 1
himself 1
across 1
the 1
stream 1
and 1
this 1
time 1
he 1
got 1
safely 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
with 1
the 1
hearse 1
and 1
managed 1
to 1
get 1
Partlet 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
fox 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
mourners 1
who 1
were 1
sitting 1
behind 1
were 1
too 1
heavy 1
and 1
fell 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
were 1
all 1
carried 1
away 1
by 1
the 1
stream 1
and 1
drowned 1
Thus 1
Chanticleer 1
was 1
left 1
alone 1
with 1
his 1
dead 1
Partlet 1
and 1
having 1
dug 1
a 1
grave 1
for 1
her 1
he 1
laid 1
her 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
little 1
hillock 1
over 1
her 1
Then 1
he 1
sat 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
grave 1
and 1
wept 1
and 1
mourned 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
died 1
too 1
and 1
so 1
all 1
were 1
dead 1
RAPUNZEL 1
There 1
were 1
once 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
a 1
woman 1
who 1
had 1
long 1
in 1
vain 1
wished 1
for 1
a 1
child 1
At 1
length 1
the 1
woman 1
hoped 1
that 1
God 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
grant 1
her 1
desire 1
These 1
people 1
had 1
a 1
little 1
window 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
their 1
house 1
from 1
which 1
a 1
splendid 1
garden 1
could 1
be 1
seen 1
which 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
flowers 1
and 1
herbs 1
It 1
was 1
however 1
surrounded 1
by 1
a 1
high 1
wall 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
dared 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
it 1
because 1
it 1
belonged 1
to 1
an 1
enchantress 1
who 1
had 1
great 1
power 1
and 1
was 1
dreaded 1
by 1
all 1
the 1
world 1
One 1
day 1
the 1
woman 1
was 1
standing 1
by 1
this 1
window 1
and 1
looking 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
a 1
bed 1
which 1
was 1
planted 1
with 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
rampion 1
rapunzel 1
and 1
it 1
looked 1
so 1
fresh 1
and 1
green 1
that 1
she 1
longed 1
for 1
it 1
she 1
quite 1
pined 1
away 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
look 1
pale 1
and 1
miserable 1
Then 1
her 1
husband 1
was 1
alarmed 1
and 1
asked 1
What 1
ails 1
you 1
dear 1
wife 1
Ah 1
she 1
replied 1
if 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
eat 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
rampion 1
which 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
behind 1
our 1
house 1
I 1
shall 1
die 1
The 1
man 1
who 1
loved 1
her 1
thought 1
Sooner 1
than 1
let 1
your 1
wife 1
die 1
bring 1
her 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
rampion 1
yourself 1
let 1
it 1
cost 1
what 1
it 1
will 1
At 1
twilight 1
he 1
clambered 1
down 1
over 1
the 1
wall 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
of 1
the 1
enchantress 1
hastily 1
clutched 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
rampion 1
and 1
took 1
it 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1
She 1
at 1
once 1
made 1
herself 1
a 1
salad 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
ate 1
it 1
greedily 1
It 1
tasted 1
so 1
good 1
to 1
her 1
so 1
very 1
good 1
that 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
she 1
longed 1
for 1
it 1
three 1
times 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
before 1
If 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
have 1
any 1
rest 1
her 1
husband 1
must 1
once 1
more 1
descend 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
In 1
the 1
gloom 1
of 1
evening 1
therefore 1
he 1
let 1
himself 1
down 1
again 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
clambered 1
down 1
the 1
wall 1
he 1
was 1
terribly 1
afraid 1
for 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
enchantress 1
standing 1
before 1
him 1
How 1
can 1
you 1
dare 1
said 1
she 1
with 1
angry 1
look 1
descend 1
into 1
my 1
garden 1
and 1
steal 1
my 1
rampion 1
like 1
a 1
thief 1
You 1
shall 1
suffer 1
for 1
it 1
Ah 1
answered 1
he 1
let 1
mercy 1
take 1
the 1
place 1
of 1
justice 1
I 1
only 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
necessity 1
My 1
wife 1
saw 1
your 1
rampion 1
from 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
felt 1
such 1
a 1
longing 1
for 1
it 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
died 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
not 1
got 1
some 1
to 1
eat 1
Then 1
the 1
enchantress 1
allowed 1
her 1
anger 1
to 1
be 1
softened 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
If 1
the 1
case 1
be 1
as 1
you 1
say 1
I 1
will 1
allow 1
you 1
to 1
take 1
away 1
with 1
you 1
as 1
much 1
rampion 1
as 1
you 1
will 1
only 1
I 1
make 1
one 1
condition 1
you 1
must 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
child 1
which 1
your 1
wife 1
will 1
bring 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
it 1
shall 1
be 1
well 1
treated 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
care 1
for 1
it 1
like 1
a 1
mother 1
The 1
man 1
in 1
his 1
terror 1
consented 1
to 1
everything 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
woman 1
was 1
brought 1
to 1
bed 1
the 1
enchantress 1
appeared 1
at 1
once 1
gave 1
the 1
child 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
Rapunzel 1
and 1
took 1
it 1
away 1
with 1
her 1
Rapunzel 1
grew 1
into 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
child 1
under 1
the 1
sun 1
When 1
she 1
was 1
twelve 1
years 1
old 1
the 1
enchantress 1
shut 1
her 1
into 1
a 1
tower 1
which 1
lay 1
in 1
a 1
forest 1
and 1
had 1
neither 1
stairs 1
nor 1
door 1
but 1
quite 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
window 1
When 1
the 1
enchantress 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
in 1
she 1
placed 1
herself 1
beneath 1
it 1
and 1
cried 1
Rapunzel 2
Let 1
down 1
your 1
hair 1
to 1
me 1
Rapunzel 1
had 1
magnificent 1
long 1
hair 1
fine 1
as 1
spun 1
gold 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
heard 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
the 1
enchantress 1
she 1
unfastened 1
her 1
braided 1
tresses 1
wound 1
them 1
round 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
hooks 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
above 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
hair 1
fell 1
twenty 1
ells 1
down 1
and 1
the 1
enchantress 1
climbed 1
up 1
by 1
it 1
After 1
a 1
year 1
or 1
two 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
pass 1
that 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
rode 1
through 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
passed 1
by 1
the 1
tower 1
Then 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
song 1
which 1
was 1
so 1
charming 1
that 1
he 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
listened 1
This 1
was 1
Rapunzel 1
who 1
in 1
her 1
solitude 1
passed 1
her 1
time 1
in 1
letting 1
her 1
sweet 1
voice 1
resound 1
The 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
wanted 1
to 1
climb 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
looked 1
for 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
tower 1
but 1
none 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
He 1
rode 1
home 1
but 1
the 1
singing 1
had 1
so 1
deeply 1
touched 1
his 1
heart 1
that 1
every 1
day 1
he 1
went 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
listened 1
to 1
it 1
Once 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
thus 1
standing 1
behind 1
a 1
tree 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
an 1
enchantress 1
came 1
there 1
and 1
he 1
heard 1
how 1
she 1
cried 1
Rapunzel 2
Let 1
down 1
your 1
hair 1
to 1
me 1
Then 1
Rapunzel 1
let 1
down 1
the 1
braids 1
of 1
her 1
hair 1
and 1
the 1
enchantress 1
climbed 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
If 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
ladder 1
by 1
which 1
one 1
mounts 1
I 1
too 1
will 1
try 1
my 1
fortune 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
when 1
it 1
began 1
to 1
grow 1
dark 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
tower 1
and 1
cried 1
Rapunzel 2
Let 1
down 1
your 1
hair 1
to 1
me 1
Immediately 1
the 1
hair 1
fell 1
down 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
climbed 1
up 1
At 1
first 1
Rapunzel 1
was 1
terribly 1
frightened 1
when 1
a 1
man 1
such 1
as 1
her 1
eyes 1
had 1
never 1
yet 1
beheld 1
came 1
to 1
her 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
began 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
her 1
quite 1
like 1
a 1
friend 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
that 1
his 1
heart 1
had 1
been 1
so 1
stirred 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
let 1
him 1
have 1
no 1
rest 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
forced 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
Then 1
Rapunzel 1
lost 1
her 1
fear 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
asked 1
her 1
if 1
she 1
would 1
take 1
him 1
for 1
her 1
husband 1
and 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
young 1
and 1
handsome 1
she 1
thought 1
He 1
will 1
love 1
me 1
more 1
than 1
old 1
Dame 1
Gothel 1
does 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
yes 1
and 1
laid 1
her 1
hand 1
in 1
his 1
She 1
said 1
I 1
will 1
willingly 1
go 1
away 1
with 1
you 1
but 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
get 1
down 1
Bring 1
with 1
you 1
a 1
skein 1
of 1
silk 1
every 1
time 1
that 1
you 1
come 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
weave 1
a 1
ladder 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
that 1
is 1
ready 1
I 1
will 1
descend 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
take 1
me 1
on 1
your 1
horse 1
They 1
agreed 1
that 1
until 1
that 1
time 1
he 1
should 1
come 1
to 1
her 1
every 1
evening 1
for 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
came 1
by 1
day 1
The 1
enchantress 1
remarked 1
nothing 1
of 1
this 1
until 1
once 1
Rapunzel 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
Tell 1
me 1
Dame 1
Gothel 1
how 1
it 1
happens 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
so 1
much 1
heavier 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
draw 1
up 1
than 1
the 1
young 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
he 1
is 1
with 1
me 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
Ah 1
you 1
wicked 1
child 1
cried 1
the 1
enchantress 1
What 1
do 1
I 1
hear 1
you 1
say 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
had 1
separated 1
you 1
from 1
all 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
yet 1
you 1
have 1
deceived 1
me 1
In 1
her 1
anger 1
she 1
clutched 1
Rapunzel 1
s 1
beautiful 1
tresses 1
wrapped 1
them 1
twice 1
round 1
her 1
left 1
hand 1
seized 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
scissors 1
with 1
the 1
right 1
and 1
snip 1
snap 1
they 1
were 1
cut 1
off 1
and 1
the 1
lovely 1
braids 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
And 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
pitiless 1
that 1
she 1
took 1
poor 1
Rapunzel 1
into 1
a 1
desert 1
where 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
great 1
grief 1
and 1
misery 1
On 1
the 1
same 1
day 1
that 1
she 1
cast 1
out 1
Rapunzel 1
however 1
the 1
enchantress 1
fastened 1
the 1
braids 1
of 1
hair 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
cut 1
off 1
to 1
the 1
hook 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
came 1
and 1
cried 1
Rapunzel 2
Let 1
down 1
your 1
hair 1
to 1
me 1
she 1
let 1
the 1
hair 1
down 1
The 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
ascended 1
but 1
instead 1
of 1
finding 1
his 1
dearest 1
Rapunzel 1
he 1
found 1
the 1
enchantress 1
who 1
gazed 1
at 1
him 1
with 1
wicked 1
and 1
venomous 1
looks 1
Aha 1
she 1
cried 1
mockingly 1
you 1
would 1
fetch 1
your 1
dearest 1
but 1
the 1
beautiful 1
bird 1
sits 1
no 1
longer 1
singing 1
in 1
the 1
nest 1
the 1
cat 1
has 1
got 1
it 1
and 1
will 1
scratch 1
out 1
your 1
eyes 1
as 1
well 1
Rapunzel 1
is 1
lost 1
to 1
you 2
will 1
never 1
see 1
her 1
again 1
The 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
was 1
beside 1
himself 1
with 1
pain 1
and 1
in 1
his 1
despair 1
he 1
leapt 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
tower 1
He 1
escaped 1
with 1
his 1
life 1
but 1
the 1
thorns 1
into 1
which 1
he 1
fell 1
pierced 1
his 1
eyes 1
Then 1
he 1
wandered 1
quite 1
blind 1
about 1
the 1
forest 1
ate 1
nothing 1
but 1
roots 1
and 1
berries 1
and 1
did 1
naught 1
but 1
lament 1
and 1
weep 1
over 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
his 1
dearest 1
wife 1
Thus 1
he 1
roamed 1
about 1
in 1
misery 1
for 1
some 1
years 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
desert 1
where 1
Rapunzel 1
with 1
the 1
twins 1
to 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
given 1
birth 1
a 1
boy 1
and 1
a 1
girl 1
lived 1
in 1
wretchedness 1
He 1
heard 1
a 1
voice 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
so 1
familiar 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
went 1
towards 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
approached 1
Rapunzel 1
knew 1
him 1
and 1
fell 1
on 1
his 1
neck 1
and 1
wept 1
Two 1
of 1
her 1
tears 1
wetted 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
they 1
grew 1
clear 1
again 1
and 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
with 1
them 1
as 1
before 1
He 1
led 1
her 1
to 1
his 1
kingdom 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
joyfully 1
received 1
and 1
they 1
lived 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
afterwards 1
happy 1
and 1
contented 1
FUNDEVOGEL 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
forester 1
who 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
to 1
hunt 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
entered 1
it 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
sound 1
of 1
screaming 1
as 1
if 1
a 1
little 1
child 1
were 1
there 1
He 1
followed 1
the 1
sound 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
high 1
tree 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
this 1
a 1
little 1
child 1
was 1
sitting 1
for 1
the 1
mother 1
had 1
fallen 1
asleep 1
under 1
the 1
tree 1
with 1
the 1
child 1
and 1
a 1
bird 1
of 1
prey 1
had 1
seen 1
it 1
in 1
her 1
arms 1
had 1
flown 1
down 1
snatched 1
it 1
away 1
and 1
set 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
high 1
tree 1
The 1
forester 1
climbed 1
up 1
brought 1
the 1
child 1
down 1
and 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
You 1
will 1
take 1
him 1
home 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
bring 1
him 1
up 1
with 1
your 1
Lina 1
He 1
took 1
it 1
home 1
therefore 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
children 1
grew 1
up 1
together 1
And 1
the 1
one 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
found 1
on 1
a 1
tree 1
was 1
called 1
Fundevogel 1
because 1
a 1
bird 1
had 1
carried 1
it 1
away 1
Fundevogel 1
and 1
Lina 1
loved 1
each 1
other 1
so 1
dearly 1
that 1
when 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
see 1
each 1
other 1
they 1
were 1
sad 1
Now 1
the 1
forester 1
had 1
an 1
old 1
cook 1
who 1
one 1
evening 1
took 1
two 1
pails 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
fetch 1
water 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
go 1
once 1
only 1
but 1
many 1
times 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
spring 1
Lina 1
saw 1
this 1
and 1
said 1
Listen 1
old 1
Sanna 1
why 1
are 1
you 1
fetching 1
so 1
much 1
water 1
If 1
you 1
will 1
never 1
repeat 1
it 1
to 1
anyone 1
I 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
why 1
So 1
Lina 1
said 1
no 1
she 1
would 1
never 1
repeat 1
it 1
to 1
anyone 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
cook 1
said 1
Early 1
tomorrow 1
morning 1
when 1
the 1
forester 1
is 1
out 1
hunting 1
I 1
will 1
heat 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
is 1
boiling 1
in 1
the 1
kettle 1
I 1
will 1
throw 1
in 1
Fundevogel 1
and 1
will 1
boil 1
him 1
in 1
it 1
Early 1
next 1
morning 1
the 1
forester 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
hunting 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
gone 1
the 1
children 1
were 1
still 1
in 1
bed 1
Then 1
Lina 1
said 1
to 1
Fundevogel 1
If 1
you 1
will 1
never 1
leave 1
me 1
I 1
too 1
will 1
never 1
leave 1
you 1
Fundevogel 1
said 1
Neither 1
now 1
nor 1
ever 1
will 1
I 1
leave 1
you 1
Then 1
said 1
Lina 1
Then 1
will 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
Last 1
night 1
old 1
Sanna 1
carried 1
so 1
many 1
buckets 1
of 1
water 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
that 1
I 1
asked 1
her 1
why 1
she 1
was 1
doing 1
that 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
that 1
if 1
I 1
would 1
promise 1
not 1
to 1
tell 1
anyone 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
that 1
early 1
tomorrow 1
morning 1
when 1
father 1
was 1
out 1
hunting 1
she 1
would 1
set 1
the 1
kettle 1
full 1
of 1
water 1
throw 1
you 1
into 1
it 1
and 1
boil 1
you 1
but 1
we 1
will 1
get 1
up 1
quickly 1
dress 1
ourselves 1
and 1
go 1
away 1
together 1
The 1
two 1
children 1
therefore 1
got 1
up 1
dressed 1
themselves 1
quickly 1
and 1
went 1
away 1
When 1
the 1
water 1
in 1
the 1
kettle 1
was 1
boiling 1
the 1
cook 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
bedroom 1
to 1
fetch 1
Fundevogel 1
and 1
throw 1
him 1
into 1
it 1
But 1
when 1
she 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
beds 1
both 1
the 1
children 1
were 1
gone 1
Then 1
she 1
was 1
terribly 1
alarmed 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
herself 1
What 1
shall 1
I 1
say 1
now 1
when 1
the 1
forester 1
comes 1
home 1
and 1
sees 1
that 1
the 1
children 1
are 1
gone 1
They 1
must 1
be 1
followed 1
instantly 1
to 1
get 1
them 1
back 1
again 1
Then 1
the 1
cook 1
sent 1
three 1
servants 1
after 1
them 1
who 1
were 1
to 1
run 1
and 1
overtake 1
the 1
children 1
The 1
children 1
however 1
were 1
sitting 1
outside 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
saw 1
from 1
afar 1
the 1
three 1
servants 1
running 1
Lina 1
said 1
to 1
Fundevogel 1
Never 1
leave 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
never 1
leave 1
you 1
Fundevogel 1
said 1
Neither 1
now 1
nor 1
ever 1
Then 1
said 1
Lina 1
Do 1
you 1
become 1
a 1
rose 1
tree 1
and 1
I 1
the 1
rose 1
upon 1
it 1
When 1
the 1
three 1
servants 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
forest 1
nothing 1
was 1
there 1
but 1
a 1
rose 1
tree 1
and 1
one 1
rose 1
on 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
children 1
were 1
nowhere 1
Then 1
said 1
they 1
There 1
is 1
nothing 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
here 1
and 1
they 1
went 1
home 1
and 1
told 1
the 1
cook 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
seen 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
forest 1
but 1
a 1
little 1
rose 1
bush 1
with 1
one 1
rose 1
on 1
it 1
Then 1
the 1
old 1
cook 1
scolded 1
and 1
said 1
You 1
simpletons 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
cut 1
the 1
rose 1
bush 1
in 1
two 1
and 1
have 1
broken 1
off 1
the 1
rose 1
and 1
brought 1
it 1
home 1
with 1
you 1
go 1
and 1
do 1
it 1
at 1
once 1
They 1
had 1
therefore 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
and 1
look 1
for 1
the 1
second 1
time 1
The 1
children 1
however 1
saw 1
them 1
coming 1
from 1
a 1
distance 1
Then 1
Lina 1
said 1
Fundevogel 1
never 1
leave 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
never 1
leave 1
you 1
Fundevogel 1
said 1
Neither 1
now 1
nor 1
ever 1
Said 1
Lina 1
Then 1
do 1
you 1
become 1
a 1
church 1
and 1
I 1
ll 1
be 1
the 1
chandelier 1
in 1
it 1
So 1
when 1
the 1
three 1
servants 1
came 1
nothing 1
was 1
there 1
but 1
a 1
church 1
with 1
a 1
chandelier 1
in 1
it 1
They 1
said 1
therefore 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
What 1
can 1
we 1
do 1
here 1
let 1
us 1
go 1
home 1
When 1
they 1
got 1
home 1
the 1
cook 1
asked 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
found 1
them 1
so 1
they 1
said 1
no 1
they 1
had 1
found 1
nothing 1
but 1
a 1
church 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
chandelier 1
in 1
it 1
And 1
the 1
cook 1
scolded 1
them 1
and 1
said 1
You 1
fools 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
not 1
pull 1
the 1
church 1
to 1
pieces 1
and 1
bring 1
the 1
chandelier 1
home 1
with 1
you 1
And 1
now 1
the 1
old 1
cook 1
herself 1
got 1
on 1
her 1
legs 1
and 1
went 1
with 1
the 1
three 1
servants 1
in 1
pursuit 1
of 1
the 1
children 1
The 1
children 1
however 1
saw 1
from 1
afar 1
that 1
the 1
three 1
servants 1
were 1
coming 1
and 1
the 1
cook 1
waddling 1
after 1
them 1
Then 1
said 1
Lina 1
Fundevogel 1
never 1
leave 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
never 1
leave 1
you 1
Then 1
said 1
Fundevogel 1
Neither 1
now 1
nor 1
ever 1
Said 1
Lina 1
Be 1
a 1
fishpond 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
duck 1
upon 1
it 1
The 1
cook 1
however 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
pond 1
she 1
lay 1
down 1
by 1
it 1
and 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
drink 1
it 1
up 1
But 1
the 1
duck 1
swam 1
quickly 1
to 1
her 1
seized 1
her 1
head 1
in 1
its 1
beak 1
and 1
drew 1
her 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
there 1
the 1
old 1
witch 1
had 1
to 1
drown 1
Then 1
the 1
children 1
went 1
home 1
together 1
and 1
were 1
heartily 1
delighted 1
and 1
if 1
they 1
have 1
not 1
died 1
they 1
are 1
living 1
still 1
THE 1
VALIANT 1
LITTLE 1
TAILOR 1
One 1
summer 1
s 1
morning 1
a 1
little 1
tailor 1
was 1
sitting 1
on 1
his 1
table 1
by 1
the 1
window 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
good 1
spirits 1
and 1
sewed 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
might 1
Then 1
came 1
a 1
peasant 1
woman 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
crying 1
Good 1
jams 1
cheap 1
Good 1
jams 1
cheap 1
This 1
rang 1
pleasantly 1
in 1
the 1
tailor 1
s 1
ears 1
he 1
stretched 1
his 1
delicate 1
head 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
called 1
Come 1
up 1
here 1
dear 1
woman 1
here 1
you 1
will 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
your 1
goods 1
The 1
woman 1
came 1
up 1
the 1
three 1
steps 1
to 1
the 1
tailor 1
with 1
her 1
heavy 1
basket 1
and 1
he 1
made 1
her 1
unpack 1
all 1
the 1
pots 1
for 1
him 1
He 1
inspected 1
each 1
one 1
lifted 1
it 1
up 1
put 1
his 1
nose 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
said 1
The 1
jam 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
good 1
so 1
weigh 1
me 1
out 1
four 1
ounces 1
dear 1
woman 1
and 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
pound 1
that 1
is 1
of 1
no 1
consequence 1
The 1
woman 1
who 1
had 1
hoped 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
good 1
sale 1
gave 1
him 1
what 1
he 1
desired 1
but 1
went 1
away 1
quite 1
angry 1
and 1
grumbling 1
Now 1
this 1
jam 1
shall 1
be 1
blessed 1
by 1
God 1
cried 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
health 1
and 1
strength 1
so 1
he 1
brought 1
the 1
bread 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
cupboard 1
cut 1
himself 1
a 1
piece 1
right 1
across 1
the 1
loaf 1
and 1
spread 1
the 1
jam 1
over 1
it 1
This 1
won 1
t 1
taste 1
bitter 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
I 1
will 1
just 1
finish 1
the 1
jacket 1
before 1
I 1
take 1
a 1
bite 1
He 1
laid 1
the 1
bread 1
near 1
him 1
sewed 1
on 1
and 1
in 1
his 1
joy 1
made 1
bigger 1
and 1
bigger 1
stitches 1
In 1
the 1
meantime 1
the 1
smell 1
of 1
the 1
sweet 1
jam 1
rose 1
to 1
where 1
the 1
flies 1
were 1
sitting 1
in 1
great 1
numbers 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
attracted 1
and 1
descended 1
on 1
it 1
in 1
hosts 1
Hi 1
who 1
invited 1
you 1
said 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
and 1
drove 1
the 1
unbidden 1
guests 1
away 1
The 1
flies 1
however 1
who 1
understood 1
no 1
German 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
turned 1
away 1
but 1
came 1
back 1
again 1
in 1
ever 1
increasing 1
companies 1
The 1
little 1
tailor 1
at 1
last 1
lost 1
all 1
patience 1
and 1
drew 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
cloth 1
from 1
the 1
hole 1
under 1
his 1
work 1
table 1
and 1
saying 1
Wait 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
struck 1
it 1
mercilessly 1
on 1
them 1
When 1
he 1
drew 1
it 1
away 1
and 1
counted 1
there 1
lay 1
before 1
him 1
no 1
fewer 1
than 1
seven 1
dead 1
and 1
with 1
legs 1
stretched 1
out 1
Are 1
you 1
a 1
fellow 1
of 1
that 1
sort 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
admiring 1
his 1
own 1
bravery 1
The 1
whole 1
town 1
shall 1
know 1
of 1
this 1
And 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
hastened 1
to 1
cut 1
himself 1
a 1
girdle 1
stitched 1
it 1
and 1
embroidered 1
on 1
it 1
in 1
large 1
letters 1
Seven 1
at 1
one 1
stroke 1
What 1
the 1
town 1
he 1
continued 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
shall 1
hear 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
his 1
heart 1
wagged 1
with 1
joy 1
like 1
a 1
lamb 1
s 1
tail 1
The 1
tailor 1
put 1
on 1
the 1
girdle 1
and 1
resolved 1
to 1
go 1
forth 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
because 1
he 1
thought 1
his 1
workshop 1
was 1
too 1
small 1
for 1
his 1
valour 1
Before 1
he 1
went 1
away 1
he 1
sought 1
about 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
anything 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
take 1
with 1
him 1
however 1
he 1
found 1
nothing 1
but 1
an 1
old 1
cheese 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
put 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
In 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
observed 1
a 1
bird 1
which 1
had 1
caught 1
itself 1
in 1
the 1
thicket 1
It 1
had 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
his 1
pocket 1
with 1
the 1
cheese 1
Now 1
he 1
took 1
to 1
the 1
road 1
boldly 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
light 1
and 1
nimble 1
he 1
felt 1
no 1
fatigue 1
The 1
road 1
led 1
him 1
up 1
a 1
mountain 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
highest 1
point 1
of 1
it 1
there 1
sat 1
a 1
powerful 1
giant 1
looking 1
peacefully 1
about 1
him 1
The 1
little 1
tailor 1
went 1
bravely 1
up 1
spoke 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
Good 1
day 1
comrade 1
so 1
you 1
are 1
sitting 1
there 1
overlooking 1
the 1
wide 1
spread 1
world 1
I 1
am 1
just 1
on 1
my 1
way 1
thither 1
and 1
want 1
to 1
try 1
my 1
luck 1
Have 1
you 1
any 1
inclination 1
to 1
go 1
with 1
me 1
The 1
giant 1
looked 1
contemptuously 1
at 1
the 1
tailor 1
and 1
said 1
You 1
ragamuffin 1
You 1
miserable 1
creature 1
Oh 1
indeed 1
answered 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
and 1
unbuttoned 1
his 1
coat 1
and 1
showed 1
the 1
giant 1
the 1
girdle 1
there 1
may 1
you 1
read 1
what 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
I 1
am 1
The 1
giant 1
read 1
Seven 1
at 1
one 1
stroke 1
and 1
thought 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
men 1
whom 1
the 1
tailor 1
had 1
killed 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
a 1
little 1
respect 1
for 1
the 1
tiny 1
fellow 1
Nevertheless 1
he 1
wished 1
to 1
try 1
him 1
first 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
stone 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
squeezed 1
it 1
together 1
so 1
that 1
water 1
dropped 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
Do 1
that 1
likewise 1
said 1
the 1
giant 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
strength 1
Is 1
that 1
all 1
said 1
the 1
tailor 1
that 1
is 1
child 1
s 1
play 1
with 1
us 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
into 1
his 1
pocket 1
brought 1
out 1
the 1
soft 1
cheese 1
and 1
pressed 1
it 1
until 1
the 1
liquid 1
ran 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
Faith 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
better 1
wasn 1
t 1
it 1
The 1
giant 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
believe 1
it 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
Then 1
the 1
giant 1
picked 1
up 1
a 1
stone 1
and 1
threw 1
it 1
so 1
high 1
that 1
the 1
eye 1
could 1
scarcely 1
follow 1
it 1
Now 1
little 1
mite 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
do 1
that 1
likewise 1
Well 1
thrown 1
said 1
the 1
tailor 1
but 1
after 1
all 1
the 1
stone 1
came 1
down 1
to 1
earth 1
again 1
I 1
will 1
throw 1
you 1
one 1
which 1
shall 1
never 1
come 1
back 1
at 1
all 1
and 1
he 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
into 1
his 1
pocket 1
took 1
out 1
the 1
bird 1
and 1
threw 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
The 1
bird 1
delighted 1
with 1
its 1
liberty 1
rose 1
flew 1
away 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
back 1
How 1
does 1
that 1
shot 1
please 1
you 1
comrade 1
asked 1
the 1
tailor 1
You 1
can 1
certainly 1
throw 1
said 1
the 1
giant 1
but 1
now 1
we 1
will 1
see 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
able 1
to 1
carry 1
anything 1
properly 1
He 1
took 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
to 1
a 1
mighty 1
oak 1
tree 1
which 1
lay 1
there 1
felled 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
said 1
If 1
you 1
are 1
strong 1
enough 1
help 1
me 1
to 1
carry 1
the 1
tree 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
Readily 1
answered 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
take 1
you 1
the 1
trunk 1
on 1
your 1
shoulders 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
raise 1
up 1
the 1
branches 1
and 1
twigs 1
after 1
all 1
they 1
are 1
the 1
heaviest 1
The 1
giant 1
took 1
the 1
trunk 1
on 1
his 1
shoulder 1
but 1
the 1
tailor 1
seated 1
himself 1
on 1
a 1
branch 1
and 1
the 1
giant 1
who 1
could 1
not 1
look 1
round 1
had 1
to 1
carry 1
away 1
the 1
whole 1
tree 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
into 1
the 1
bargain 1
he 1
behind 1
was 1
quite 1
merry 1
and 1
happy 1
and 1
whistled 1
the 1
song 1
Three 1
tailors 1
rode 1
forth 1
from 1
the 1
gate 1
as 1
if 1
carrying 1
the 1
tree 1
were 1
child 1
s 1
play 1
The 1
giant 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
dragged 1
the 1
heavy 1
burden 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
could 1
go 1
no 1
further 1
and 1
cried 1
Hark 1
you 1
I 1
shall 1
have 1
to 1
let 1
the 1
tree 1
fall 1
The 1
tailor 1
sprang 1
nimbly 1
down 1
seized 1
the 1
tree 1
with 1
both 1
arms 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
carrying 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
giant 1
You 1
are 1
such 1
a 1
great 1
fellow 1
and 1
yet 1
cannot 1
even 1
carry 1
the 1
tree 1
They 1
went 1
on 1
together 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
passed 1
a 1
cherry 1
tree 1
the 1
giant 1
laid 1
hold 1
of 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
where 1
the 1
ripest 1
fruit 1
was 1
hanging 1
bent 1
it 1
down 1
gave 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
tailor 1
s 1
hand 1
and 1
bade 1
him 1
eat 1
But 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
was 1
much 1
too 1
weak 1
to 1
hold 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
giant 1
let 1
it 1
go 1
it 1
sprang 1
back 1
again 1
and 1
the 1
tailor 1
was 1
tossed 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
with 1
it 1
When 1
he 1
had 1
fallen 1
down 1
again 1
without 1
injury 1
the 1
giant 1
said 1
What 1
is 1
this 1
Have 1
you 1
not 1
strength 1
enough 1
to 1
hold 1
the 1
weak 1
twig 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
lack 1
of 1
strength 1
answered 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
Do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
could 1
be 1
anything 1
to 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
has 1
struck 1
down 1
seven 1
at 1
one 1
blow 1
I 1
leapt 1
over 1
the 1
tree 1
because 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
are 1
shooting 1
down 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
thicket 1
Jump 1
as 1
I 1
did 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
do 1
it 1
The 1
giant 1
made 1
the 1
attempt 1
but 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
get 1
over 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
remained 1
hanging 1
in 1
the 1
branches 1
so 1
that 1
in 1
this 1
also 1
the 1
tailor 1
kept 1
the 1
upper 1
hand 1
The 1
giant 1
said 1
If 1
you 1
are 1
such 1
a 1
valiant 1
fellow 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
into 1
our 1
cavern 1
and 1
spend 1
the 1
night 1
with 1
us 1
The 1
little 1
tailor 1
was 1
willing 1
and 1
followed 1
him 1
When 1
they 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
cave 1
other 1
giants 1
were 1
sitting 1
there 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
each 1
of 1
them 1
had 1
a 1
roasted 1
sheep 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
was 1
eating 1
it 1
The 1
little 1
tailor 1
looked 1
round 1
and 1
thought 1
It 1
is 1
much 1
more 1
spacious 1
here 1
than 1
in 1
my 1
workshop 1
The 1
giant 1
showed 1
him 1
a 1
bed 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
lie 1
down 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
sleep 1
The 1
bed 1
however 1
was 1
too 1
big 1
for 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
lie 1
down 1
in 1
it 1
but 1
crept 1
into 1
a 1
corner 1
When 1
it 1
was 1
midnight 1
and 1
the 1
giant 1
thought 1
that 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
was 1
lying 1
in 1
a 1
sound 1
sleep 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
took 1
a 1
great 1
iron 1
bar 1
cut 1
through 1
the 1
bed 1
with 1
one 1
blow 1
and 1
thought 1
he 1
had 1
finished 1
off 1
the 1
grasshopper 1
for 1
good 1
With 1
the 1
earliest 1
dawn 1
the 1
giants 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
had 1
quite 1
forgotten 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
when 1
all 1
at 1
once 1
he 1
walked 1
up 1
to 1
them 1
quite 1
merrily 1
and 1
boldly 1
The 1
giants 1
were 1
terrified 1
they 1
were 1
afraid 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
strike 1
them 1
all 1
dead 1
and 1
ran 1
away 1
in 1
a 1
great 1
hurry 1
The 1
little 1
tailor 1
went 1
onwards 1
always 1
following 1
his 1
own 1
pointed 1
nose 1
After 1
he 1
had 1
walked 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
courtyard 1
of 1
a 1
royal 1
palace 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
felt 1
weary 1
he 1
lay 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
grass 1
and 1
fell 1
asleep 1
Whilst 1
he 1
lay 1
there 1
the 1
people 1
came 1
and 1
inspected 1
him 1
on 1
all 1
sides 1
and 1
read 1
on 1
his 1
girdle 1
Seven 1
at 1
one 1
stroke 1
Ah 1
said 1
they 1
what 1
does 1
the 1
great 1
warrior 1
want 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
peace 1
He 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
mighty 1
lord 1
They 1
went 1
and 1
announced 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
gave 1
it 1
as 1
their 1
opinion 1
that 1
if 1
war 1
should 1
break 1
out 1
this 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
weighty 1
and 1
useful 1
man 1
who 1
ought 1
on 1
no 1
account 1
to 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
depart 1
The 1
counsel 1
pleased 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
he 1
sent 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
courtiers 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
to 1
offer 1
him 1
military 1
service 1
when 1
he 1
awoke 1
The 1
ambassador 1
remained 1
standing 1
by 1
the 1
sleeper 1
waited 1
until 1
he 1
stretched 1
his 1
limbs 1
and 1
opened 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
then 1
conveyed 1
to 1
him 1
this 1
proposal 1
For 1
this 1
very 1
reason 1
have 1
I 1
come 1
here 1
the 1
tailor 1
replied 1
I 1
am 1
ready 1
to 1
enter 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
service 1
He 1
was 1
therefore 1
honourably 1
received 1
and 1
a 1
special 1
dwelling 1
was 1
assigned 1
him 1
The 1
soldiers 1
however 1
were 1
set 1
against 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
and 1
wished 1
him 1
a 1
thousand 1
miles 1
away 1
What 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
this 1
they 1
said 1
among 1
themselves 1
If 1
we 1
quarrel 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
strikes 1
about 1
him 1
seven 1
of 1
us 1
will 1
fall 1
at 1
every 1
blow 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
us 1
can 1
stand 1
against 1
him 1
They 1
came 1
therefore 1
to 1
a 1
decision 1
betook 1
themselves 1
in 1
a 1
body 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
begged 1
for 1
their 1
dismissal 1
We 1
are 1
not 1
prepared 1
said 1
they 1
to 1
stay 1
with 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
kills 1
seven 1
at 1
one 1
stroke 1
The 1
king 1
was 1
sorry 1
that 1
for 1
the 1
sake 1
of 1
one 1
he 1
should 1
lose 1
all 1
his 1
faithful 1
servants 1
wished 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
set 1
eyes 1
on 1
the 1
tailor 1
and 1
would 1
willingly 1
have 1
been 1
rid 1
of 1
him 1
again 1
But 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
venture 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
his 1
dismissal 1
for 1
he 1
dreaded 1
lest 1
he 1
should 1
strike 1
him 1
and 1
all 1
his 1
people 1
dead 1
and 1
place 1
himself 1
on 1
the 1
royal 1
throne 1
He 1
thought 1
about 1
it 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
found 1
good 1
counsel 1
He 1
sent 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
and 1
caused 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
informed 1
that 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
warrior 1
he 1
had 1
one 1
request 1
to 1
make 1
to 1
him 1
In 1
a 1
forest 1
of 1
his 1
country 1
lived 1
two 1
giants 1
who 1
caused 1
great 1
mischief 1
with 1
their 1
robbing 1
murdering 1
ravaging 1
and 1
burning 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
could 1
approach 1
them 1
without 1
putting 1
himself 1
in 1
danger 1
of 1
death 1
If 1
the 1
tailor 1
conquered 1
and 1
killed 1
these 1
two 1
giants 1
he 1
would 1
give 1
him 1
his 1
only 1
daughter 1
to 1
wife 1
and 1
half 1
of 1
his 1
kingdom 1
as 1
a 1
dowry 1
likewise 1
one 1
hundred 1
horsemen 1
should 1
go 1
with 1
him 1
to 1
assist 1
him 1
That 1
would 1
indeed 1
be 1
a 1
fine 1
thing 1
for 1
a 1
man 1
like 1
me 1
thought 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
One 1
is 1
not 1
offered 1
a 1
beautiful 1
princess 1
and 1
half 1
a 1
kingdom 1
every 1
day 1
of 1
one 1
s 1
life 1
Oh 1
yes 1
he 1
replied 1
I 1
will 1
soon 1
subdue 1
the 1
giants 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
require 1
the 1
help 1
of 1
the 1
hundred 1
horsemen 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
he 1
who 1
can 1
hit 1
seven 1
with 1
one 1
blow 1
has 1
no 1
need 1
to 1
be 1
afraid 1
of 1
two 1
The 1
little 1
tailor 1
went 1
forth 1
and 1
the 1
hundred 1
horsemen 1
followed 1
him 1
When 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
outskirts 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
his 1
followers 1
Just 1
stay 1
waiting 1
here 1
I 1
alone 1
will 1
soon 1
finish 1
off 1
the 1
giants 1
Then 1
he 1
bounded 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
looked 1
about 1
right 1
and 1
left 1
After 1
a 1
while 1
he 1
perceived 1
both 1
giants 1
They 1
lay 1
sleeping 1
under 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
snored 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
branches 1
waved 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
The 1
little 1
tailor 1
not 1
idle 1
gathered 1
two 1
pocketsful 1
of 1
stones 1
and 1
with 1
these 1
climbed 1
up 1
the 1
tree 1
When 1
he 1
was 1
halfway 1
up 1
he 1
slipped 1
down 1
by 1
a 1
branch 1
until 1
he 1
sat 1
just 1
above 1
the 1
sleepers 1
and 1
then 1
let 1
one 1
stone 1
after 1
another 1
fall 1
on 1
the 1
breast 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
giants 1
For 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
the 1
giant 1
felt 1
nothing 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
awoke 1
pushed 1
his 1
comrade 1
and 1
said 1
Why 1
are 1
you 1
knocking 1
me 1
You 1
must 1
be 1
dreaming 1
said 1
the 1
other 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
knocking 1
you 1
They 1
laid 1
themselves 1
down 1
to 1
sleep 1
again 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
tailor 1
threw 1
a 1
stone 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
second 1
What 1
is 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
this 1
cried 1
the 1
other 1
Why 1
are 1
you 1
pelting 1
me 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
pelting 1
you 1
answered 1
the 1
first 1
growling 1
They 1
disputed 1
about 1
it 1
for 1
a 1
time 1
but 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
weary 1
they 1
let 1
the 1
matter 1
rest 1
and 1
their 1
eyes 1
closed 1
once 1
more 1
The 1
little 1
tailor 1
began 1
his 1
game 1
again 1
picked 1
out 1
the 1
biggest 1
stone 1
and 1
threw 1
it 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
might 1
on 1
the 1
breast 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
giant 1
That 1
is 1
too 1
bad 1
cried 1
he 1
and 1
sprang 1
up 1
like 1
a 1
madman 1
and 1
pushed 1
his 1
companion 1
against 1
the 1
tree 1
until 1
it 1
shook 1
The 1
other 1
paid 1
him 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
coin 1
and 1
they 1
got 1
into 1
such 1
a 1
rage 1
that 1
they 1
tore 1
up 1
trees 1
and 1
belaboured 1
each 1
other 1
so 1
long 1
that 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
both 1
fell 1
down 1
dead 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
Then 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
leapt 1
down 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
lucky 1
thing 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
tear 1
up 1
the 1
tree 1
on 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
sitting 1
or 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
had 1
to 1
sprint 1
on 1
to 1
another 1
like 1
a 1
squirrel 1
but 1
we 1
tailors 1
are 1
nimble 1
He 1
drew 1
out 1
his 1
sword 1
and 1
gave 1
each 1
of 1
them 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
thrusts 1
in 1
the 1
breast 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
horsemen 1
and 1
said 1
The 1
work 1
is 1
done 1
I 1
have 1
finished 1
both 1
of 1
them 1
off 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
hard 1
work 1
They 1
tore 1
up 1
trees 1
in 1
their 1
sore 1
need 1
and 1
defended 1
themselves 1
with 1
them 1
but 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
to 1
no 1
purpose 1
when 1
a 1
man 1
like 1
myself 1
comes 1
who 1
can 1
kill 1
seven 1
at 1
one 1
blow 1
But 1
are 1
you 1
not 1
wounded 1
asked 1
the 1
horsemen 1
You 1
need 1
not 1
concern 1
yourself 1
about 1
that 1
answered 1
the 1
tailor 1
they 1
have 1
not 1
bent 1
one 1
hair 1
of 1
mine 1
The 1
horsemen 1
would 1
not 1
believe 1
him 1
and 1
rode 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
there 1
they 1
found 1
the 1
giants 1
swimming 1
in 1
their 1
blood 1
and 1
all 1
round 1
about 1
lay 1
the 1
torn 1
up 1
trees 1
The 1
little 1
tailor 1
demanded 1
of 1
the 1
king 1
the 1
promised 1
reward 1
he 1
however 1
repented 1
of 1
his 1
promise 1
and 1
again 1
bethought 1
himself 1
how 1
he 1
could 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
the 1
hero 1
Before 1
you 1
receive 1
my 1
daughter 1
and 1
the 1
half 1
of 1
my 1
kingdom 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
him 1
you 1
must 1
perform 1
one 1
more 1
heroic 1
deed 1
In 1
the 1
forest 1
roams 1
a 1
unicorn 1
which 1
does 1
great 1
harm 1
and 1
you 1
must 1
catch 1
it 1
first 1
I 1
fear 1
one 1
unicorn 1
still 1
less 1
than 1
two 1
giants 1
Seven 1
at 1
one 1
blow 1
is 1
my 1
kind 1
of 1
affair 1
He 1
took 1
a 1
rope 1
and 1
an 1
axe 1
with 1
him 1
went 1
forth 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
again 1
bade 1
those 1
who 1
were 1
sent 1
with 1
him 1
to 1
wait 1
outside 1
He 1
had 1
not 1
long 1
to 1
seek 1
The 1
unicorn 1
soon 1
came 1
towards 1
him 1
and 1
rushed 1
directly 1
on 1
the 1
tailor 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
would 1
gore 1
him 1
with 1
its 1
horn 1
without 1
more 1
ado 1
Softly 1
softly 1
it 1
can 1
t 1
be 1
done 1
as 1
quickly 1
as 1
that 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
waited 1
until 1
the 1
animal 1
was 1
quite 1
close 1
and 1
then 1
sprang 1
nimbly 1
behind 1
the 1
tree 1
The 1
unicorn 1
ran 1
against 1
the 1
tree 1
with 1
all 1
its 1
strength 1
and 1
stuck 1
its 1
horn 1
so 1
fast 1
in 1
the 1
trunk 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
not 1
the 1
strength 1
enough 1
to 1
draw 1
it 1
out 1
again 1
and 1
thus 1
it 1
was 1
caught 1
Now 1
I 1
have 1
got 1
the 1
bird 1
said 1
the 1
tailor 1
and 1
came 1
out 1
from 1
behind 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
put 1
the 1
rope 1
round 1
its 1
neck 1
and 1
then 1
with 1
his 1
axe 1
he 1
hewed 1
the 1
horn 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
when 1
all 1
was 1
ready 1
he 1
led 1
the 1
beast 1
away 1
and 1
took 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
The 1
king 1
still 1
would 1
not 1
give 1
him 1
the 1
promised 1
reward 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
third 1
demand 1
Before 1
the 1
wedding 1
the 1
tailor 1
was 1
to 1
catch 1
him 1
a 1
wild 1
boar 1
that 1
made 1
great 1
havoc 1
in 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
should 1
give 1
him 1
their 1
help 1
Willingly 1
said 1
the 1
tailor 1
that 1
is 1
child 1
s 1
play 1
He 1
did 1
not 1
take 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
with 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
well 1
pleased 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
wild 1
boar 1
had 1
several 1
times 1
received 1
them 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
manner 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
inclination 1
to 1
lie 1
in 1
wait 1
for 1
him 1
When 1
the 1
boar 1
perceived 1
the 1
tailor 1
it 1
ran 1
on 1
him 1
with 1
foaming 1
mouth 1
and 1
whetted 1
tusks 1
and 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
throw 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
but 1
the 1
hero 1
fled 1
and 1
sprang 1
into 1
a 1
chapel 1
which 1
was 1
near 1
and 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
in 1
one 1
bound 1
out 1
again 1
The 1
boar 1
ran 1
after 1
him 1
but 1
the 1
tailor 1
ran 1
round 1
outside 1
and 1
shut 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
raging 1
beast 1
which 1
was 1
much 1
too 1
heavy 1
and 1
awkward 1
to 1
leap 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
was 1
caught 1
The 1
little 1
tailor 1
called 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
thither 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
see 1
the 1
prisoner 1
with 1
their 1
own 1
eyes 1
The 1
hero 1
however 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
who 1
was 1
now 1
whether 1
he 1
liked 1
it 1
or 1
not 1
obliged 1
to 1
keep 1
his 1
promise 1
and 1
gave 1
his 1
daughter 1
and 1
the 1
half 1
of 1
his 1
kingdom 1
Had 1
he 1
known 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
warlike 1
hero 1
but 1
a 1
little 1
tailor 1
who 1
was 1
standing 1
before 1
him 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
gone 1
to 1
his 1
heart 1
still 1
more 1
than 1
it 1
did 1
The 1
wedding 1
was 1
held 1
with 1
great 1
magnificence 1
and 1
small 1
joy 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
tailor 1
a 1
king 1
was 1
made 1
After 1
some 1
time 1
the 1
young 1
queen 1
heard 1
her 1
husband 1
say 1
in 1
his 1
dreams 1
at 1
night 1
Boy 1
make 1
me 1
the 1
doublet 1
and 1
patch 1
the 1
pantaloons 1
or 1
else 1
I 1
will 1
rap 1
the 1
yard 1
measure 1
over 1
your 1
ears 1
Then 1
she 1
discovered 1
in 1
what 1
state 1
of 1
life 1
the 1
young 1
lord 1
had 1
been 1
born 1
and 1
next 1
morning 1
complained 1
of 1
her 1
wrongs 1
to 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
begged 1
him 1
to 1
help 1
her 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
her 1
husband 1
who 1
was 1
nothing 1
else 1
but 1
a 1
tailor 1
The 1
king 1
comforted 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
Leave 1
your 1
bedroom 1
door 1
open 1
this 1
night 1
and 1
my 1
servants 1
shall 1
stand 1
outside 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
has 1
fallen 1
asleep 1
shall 1
go 1
in 1
bind 1
him 1
and 1
take 1
him 1
on 1
board 1
a 1
ship 1
which 1
shall 1
carry 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
wide 1
world 1
The 1
woman 1
was 1
satisfied 1
with 1
this 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
armour 1
bearer 1
who 1
had 1
heard 1
all 1
was 1
friendly 1
with 1
the 1
young 1
lord 1
and 1
informed 1
him 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
plot 1
I 1
ll 1
put 1
a 1
screw 1
into 1
that 1
business 1
said 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
At 1
night 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
with 1
his 1
wife 1
at 1
the 1
usual 1
time 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
fallen 1
asleep 1
she 1
got 1
up 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
then 1
lay 1
down 1
again 1
The 1
little 1
tailor 1
who 1
was 1
only 1
pretending 1
to 1
be 1
asleep 1
began 1
to 1
cry 1
out 1
in 1
a 1
clear 1
voice 1
Boy 1
make 1
me 1
the 1
doublet 1
and 1
patch 1
me 1
the 1
pantaloons 1
or 1
I 1
will 1
rap 1
the 1
yard 1
measure 1
over 1
your 1
ears 1
I 1
smote 1
seven 1
at 1
one 1
blow 1
I 1
killed 1
two 1
giants 1
I 1
brought 1
away 1
one 1
unicorn 1
and 1
caught 1
a 1
wild 1
boar 1
and 1
am 1
I 1
to 1
fear 1
those 1
who 1
are 1
standing 1
outside 1
the 1
room 1
When 1
these 1
men 1
heard 1
the 1
tailor 1
speaking 1
thus 1
they 1
were 1
overcome 1
by 1
a 1
great 1
dread 1
and 1
ran 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
wild 1
huntsman 1
were 1
behind 1
them 1
and 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
would 1
venture 1
anything 1
further 1
against 1
him 1
So 1
the 1
little 1
tailor 1
was 1
and 1
remained 1
a 1
king 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
HANSEL 1
AND 1
GRETEL 1
Hard 1
by 1
a 1
great 1
forest 1
dwelt 1
a 1
poor 1
wood 1
cutter 1
with 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
his 1
two 1
children 1
The 1
boy 1
was 1
called 1
Hansel 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
Gretel 1
He 1
had 1
little 1
to 1
bite 1
and 1
to 1
break 1
and 1
once 1
when 1
great 1
dearth 1
fell 1
on 1
the 1
land 1
he 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
procure 1
even 1
daily 1
bread 1
Now 1
when 1
he 1
thought 1
over 1
this 1
by 1
night 1
in 1
his 1
bed 1
and 1
tossed 1
about 1
in 1
his 1
anxiety 1
he 1
groaned 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1
What 1
is 1
to 1
become 1
of 1
us 1
How 1
are 1
we 1
to 1
feed 1
our 1
poor 1
children 1
when 1
we 1
no 1
longer 1
have 1
anything 1
even 1
for 1
ourselves 1
I 1
ll 1
tell 1
you 1
what 1
husband 1
answered 1
the 1
woman 1
early 1
tomorrow 1
morning 1
we 1
will 1
take 1
the 1
children 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
to 1
where 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
thickest 1
there 1
we 1
will 1
light 1
a 1
fire 1
for 1
them 1
and 1
give 1
each 1
of 1
them 1
one 1
more 1
piece 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
will 1
go 1
to 1
our 1
work 1
and 1
leave 1
them 1
alone 1
They 1
will 1
not 1
find 1
the 1
way 1
home 1
again 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
rid 1
of 1
them 1
No 1
wife 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
do 1
that 1
how 1
can 1
I 1
bear 1
to 1
leave 1
my 1
children 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
forest 1
the 1
wild 1
animals 1
would 1
soon 1
come 1
and 1
tear 1
them 1
to 1
pieces 1
O 1
you 1
fool 1
said 1
she 1
then 1
we 1
must 1
all 1
four 1
die 1
of 1
hunger 1
you 1
may 1
as 1
well 1
plane 1
the 1
planks 1
for 1
our 1
coffins 1
and 1
she 1
left 1
him 1
no 1
peace 1
until 1
he 1
consented 1
But 1
I 1
feel 1
very 1
sorry 1
for 1
the 1
poor 1
children 1
all 1
the 1
same 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
The 1
two 1
children 1
had 1
also 1
not 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
sleep 1
for 1
hunger 1
and 1
had 1
heard 1
what 1
their 1
stepmother 1
had 1
said 1
to 1
their 1
father 1
Gretel 1
wept 1
bitter 1
tears 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
Hansel 1
Now 1
all 1
is 1
over 1
with 1
us 1
Be 1
quiet 1
Gretel 1
said 1
Hansel 1
do 1
not 1
distress 1
yourself 1
I 1
will 1
soon 1
find 1
a 1
way 1
to 1
help 1
us 1
And 1
when 1
the 1
old 1
folks 1
had 1
fallen 1
asleep 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
put 1
on 1
his 1
little 1
coat 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
below 1
and 1
crept 1
outside 1
The 1
moon 1
shone 1
brightly 1
and 1
the 1
white 1
pebbles 1
which 1
lay 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
glittered 1
like 1
real 1
silver 1
pennies 1
Hansel 1
stooped 1
and 1
stuffed 1
the 1
little 1
pocket 1
of 1
his 1
coat 1
with 1
as 1
many 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
get 1
in 1
Then 1
he 1
went 1
back 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
Gretel 1
Be 1
comforted 1
dear 1
little 1
sister 1
and 1
sleep 1
in 1
peace 1
God 1
will 1
not 1
forsake 1
us 1
and 1
he 1
lay 1
down 1
again 1
in 1
his 1
bed 1
When 1
day 1
dawned 1
but 1
before 1
the 1
sun 1
had 1
risen 1
the 1
woman 1
came 1
and 1
awoke 1
the 1
two 1
children 1
saying 1
Get 1
up 1
you 1
sluggards 1
we 1
are 1
going 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
to 1
fetch 1
wood 1
She 1
gave 1
each 1
a 1
little 1
piece 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
said 1
There 1
is 1
something 1
for 1
your 1
dinner 1
but 1
do 1
not 1
eat 1
it 1
up 1
before 1
then 1
for 1
you 1
will 1
get 1
nothing 1
else 1
Gretel 1
took 1
the 1
bread 1
under 1
her 1
apron 1
as 1
Hansel 1
had 1
the 1
pebbles 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
Then 1
they 1
all 1
set 1
out 1
together 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
forest 1
When 1
they 1
had 1
walked 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
Hansel 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
peeped 1
back 1
at 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
did 1
so 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
His 1
father 1
said 1
Hansel 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
looking 1
at 1
there 1
and 1
staying 1
behind 1
for 1
Pay 1
attention 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
forget 1
how 1
to 1
use 1
your 1
legs 1
Ah 1
father 1
said 1
Hansel 1
I 1
am 1
looking 1
at 1
my 1
little 1
white 1
cat 1
which 1
is 1
sitting 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
and 1
wants 1
to 1
say 1
goodbye 1
to 1
me 1
The 1
wife 1
said 1
Fool 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
your 1
little 1
cat 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
morning 1
sun 1
which 1
is 1
shining 1
on 1
the 1
chimneys 1
Hansel 1
however 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
looking 1
back 1
at 1
the 1
cat 1
but 1
had 1
been 1
constantly 1
throwing 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
white 1
pebble 1
stones 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
pocket 1
on 1
the 1
road 1
When 1
they 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
the 1
father 1
said 1
Now 1
children 1
pile 1
up 1
some 1
wood 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
light 1
a 1
fire 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
cold 1
Hansel 1
and 1
Gretel 1
gathered 1
brushwood 1
together 1
as 1
high 1
as 1
a 1
little 1
hill 1
The 1
brushwood 1
was 1
lighted 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
flames 1
were 1
burning 1
very 1
high 1
the 1
woman 1
said 1
Now 1
children 1
lay 1
yourselves 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
rest 1
we 1
will 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
cut 1
some 1
wood 1
When 1
we 1
have 1
done 1
we 1
will 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
fetch 1
you 1
away 1
Hansel 1
and 1
Gretel 1
sat 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
when 1
noon 1
came 1
each 1
ate 1
a 1
little 1
piece 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
heard 1
the 1
strokes 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
axe 1
they 1
believed 1
that 1
their 1
father 1
was 1
near 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
axe 1
however 1
but 1
a 1
branch 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
fastened 1
to 1
a 1
withered 1
tree 1
which 1
the 1
wind 1
was 1
blowing 1
backwards 1
and 1
forwards 1
And 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
sitting 1
such 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
their 1
eyes 1
closed 1
with 1
fatigue 1
and 1
they 1
fell 1
fast 1
asleep 1
When 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
awoke 1
it 1
was 1
already 1
dark 1
night 1
Gretel 1
began 1
to 1
cry 1
and 1
said 1
How 1
are 1
we 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
now 1
But 1
Hansel 1
comforted 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
Just 1
wait 1
a 1
little 1
until 1
the 1
moon 1
has 1
risen 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
will 1
soon 1
find 1
the 1
way 1
And 1
when 1
the 1
full 1
moon 1
had 1
risen 1
Hansel 1
took 1
his 1
little 1
sister 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
followed 1
the 1
pebbles 1
which 1
shone 1
like 1
newly 1
coined 1
silver 1
pieces 1
and 1
showed 1
them 1
the 1
way 1
They 1
walked 1
the 1
whole 1
night 1
long 1
and 1
by 1
break 1
of 1
day 1
came 1
once 1
more 1
to 1
their 1
father 1
s 1
house 1
They 1
knocked 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
woman 1
opened 1
it 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
Hansel 1
and 1
Gretel 1
she 1
said 1
You 1
naughty 1
children 1
why 1
have 1
you 1
slept 1
so 1
long 1
in 1
the 1
forest 1
we 1
thought 1
you 1
were 1
never 1
coming 1
back 1
at 1
all 1
The 1
father 1
however 1
rejoiced 1
for 1
it 1
had 1
cut 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
heart 1
to 1
leave 1
them 1
behind 1
alone 1
Not 1
long 1
afterwards 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
more 1
great 1
dearth 1
throughout 1
the 1
land 1
and 1
the 1
children 1
heard 1
their 1
mother 1
saying 1
at 1
night 1
to 1
their 1
father 1
Everything 1
is 1
eaten 1
again 1
we 1
have 1
one 1
half 1
loaf 1
left 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
end 1
The 1
children 1
must 1
go 1
we 1
will 1
take 1
them 1
farther 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
will 1
not 1
find 1
their 1
way 1
out 1
again 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
other 1
means 1
of 1
saving 1
ourselves 1
The 1
man 1
s 1
heart 1
was 1
heavy 1
and 1
he 1
thought 1
It 1
would 1
be 1
better 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
share 1
the 1
last 1
mouthful 1
with 1
your 1
children 1
The 1
woman 1
however 1
would 1
listen 1
to 1
nothing 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
say 1
but 1
scolded 1
and 1
reproached 1
him 1
He 1
who 1
says 1
A 1
must 1
say 1
B 1
likewise 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
yielded 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
a 1
second 1
time 1
also 1
The 1
children 1
however 1
were 1
still 1
awake 1
and 1
had 1
heard 1
the 1
conversation 1
When 1
the 1
old 1
folks 1
were 1
asleep 1
Hansel 1
again 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
and 1
pick 1
up 1
pebbles 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
before 1
but 1
the 1
woman 1
had 1
locked 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
Hansel 1
could 1
not 1
get 1
out 1
Nevertheless 1
he 1
comforted 1
his 1
little 1
sister 1
and 1
said 1
Do 1
not 1
cry 1
Gretel 1
go 1
to 1
sleep 1
quietly 1
the 1
good 1
God 1
will 1
help 1
us 1
Early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
came 1
the 1
woman 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
children 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
beds 1
Their 1
piece 1
of 1
bread 1
was 1
given 1
to 1
them 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
still 1
smaller 1
than 1
the 1
time 1
before 1
On 1
the 1
way 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
Hansel 1
crumbled 1
his 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
often 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
threw 1
a 1
morsel 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
Hansel 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
stop 1
and 1
look 1
round 1
said 1
the 1
father 1
go 1
on 1
I 1
am 1
looking 1
back 1
at 1
my 1
little 1
pigeon 1
which 1
is 1
sitting 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
and 1
wants 1
to 1
say 1
goodbye 1
to 1
me 1
answered 1
Hansel 1
Fool 1
said 1
the 1
woman 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
your 1
little 1
pigeon 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
morning 1
sun 1
that 1
is 1
shining 1
on 1
the 1
chimney 1
Hansel 1
however 1
little 1
by 1
little 1
threw 1
all 1
the 1
crumbs 1
on 1
the 1
path 1
The 1
woman 1
led 1
the 1
children 1
still 1
deeper 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
where 1
they 1
had 1
never 1
in 1
their 1
lives 1
been 1
before 1
Then 1
a 1
great 1
fire 1
was 1
again 1
made 1
and 1
the 1
mother 1
said 1
Just 1
sit 1
there 1
you 1
children 1
and 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
tired 1
you 1
may 1
sleep 1
a 1
little 1
we 1
are 1
going 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
to 1
cut 1
wood 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
when 1
we 1
are 1
done 1
we 1
will 1
come 1
and 1
fetch 1
you 1
away 1
When 1
it 1
was 1
noon 1
Gretel 1
shared 1
her 1
piece 1
of 1
bread 1
with 1
Hansel 1
who 1
had 1
scattered 1
his 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
Then 1
they 1
fell 1
asleep 1
and 1
evening 1
passed 1
but 1
no 1
one 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
poor 1
children 1
They 1
did 1
not 1
awake 1
until 1
it 1
was 1
dark 1
night 1
and 1
Hansel 1
comforted 1
his 1
little 1
sister 1
and 1
said 1
Just 1
wait 1
Gretel 1
until 1
the 1
moon 1
rises 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
the 1
crumbs 1
of 1
bread 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
strewn 1
about 1
they 1
will 1
show 1
us 1
our 1
way 1
home 1
again 1
When 1
the 1
moon 1
came 1
they 1
set 1
out 1
but 1
they 1
found 1
no 1
crumbs 1
for 1
the 1
many 1
thousands 1
of 1
birds 1
which 1
fly 1
about 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
fields 1
had 1
picked 1
them 1
all 1
up 1
Hansel 1
said 1
to 1
Gretel 1
We 1
shall 1
soon 1
find 1
the 1
way 1
but 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
find 1
it 1
They 1
walked 1
the 1
whole 1
night 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
too 1
from 1
morning 1
till 1
evening 1
but 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
were 1
very 1
hungry 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
nothing 1
to 1
eat 1
but 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
berries 1
which 1
grew 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
And 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
so 1
weary 1
that 1
their 1
legs 1
would 1
carry 1
them 1
no 1
longer 1
they 1
lay 1
down 1
beneath 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
fell 1
asleep 1
It 1
was 1
now 1
three 1
mornings 1
since 1
they 1
had 1
left 1
their 1
father 1
s 1
house 1
They 1
began 1
to 1
walk 1
again 1
but 1
they 1
always 1
came 1
deeper 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
if 1
help 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
soon 1
they 1
must 1
die 1
of 1
hunger 1
and 1
weariness 1
When 1
it 1
was 1
mid 1
day 1
they 1
saw 1
a 1
beautiful 1
snow 1
white 1
bird 1
sitting 1
on 1
a 1
bough 1
which 1
sang 1
so 1
delightfully 1
that 1
they 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
listened 1
to 1
it 1
And 1
when 1
its 1
song 1
was 1
over 1
it 1
spread 1
its 1
wings 1
and 1
flew 1
away 1
before 1
them 1
and 1
they 1
followed 1
it 1
until 1
they 1
reached 1
a 1
little 1
house 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
of 1
which 1
it 1
alighted 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
approached 1
the 1
little 1
house 1
they 1
saw 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
built 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
covered 1
with 1
cakes 1
but 1
that 1
the 1
windows 1
were 1
of 1
clear 1
sugar 1
We 1
will 1
set 1
to 1
work 1
on 1
that 1
said 1
Hansel 1
and 1
have 1
a 1
good 1
meal 1
I 1
will 1
eat 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
the 1
roof 1
and 1
you 1
Gretel 1
can 1
eat 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
it 1
will 1
taste 1
sweet 1
Hansel 1
reached 1
up 1
above 1
and 1
broke 1
off 1
a 1
little 1
of 1
the 1
roof 1
to 1
try 1
how 1
it 1
tasted 1
and 1
Gretel 1
leant 1
against 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
nibbled 1
at 1
the 1
panes 1
Then 1
a 1
soft 1
voice 1
cried 1
from 1
the 1
parlour 1
Nibble 1
nibble 1
gnaw 1
Who 1
is 1
nibbling 1
at 1
my 1
little 1
house 1
The 1
children 1
answered 1
The 1
wind 1
the 1
wind 1
The 1
heaven 1
born 1
wind 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
eating 1
without 1
disturbing 1
themselves 1
Hansel 1
who 1
liked 1
the 1
taste 1
of 1
the 1
roof 1
tore 1
down 1
a 1
great 1
piece 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
Gretel 1
pushed 1
out 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
one 1
round 1
window 1
pane 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
enjoyed 1
herself 1
with 1
it 1
Suddenly 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
a 1
woman 1
as 1
old 1
as 1
the 1
hills 1
who 1
supported 1
herself 1
on 1
crutches 1
came 1
creeping 1
out 1
Hansel 1
and 1
Gretel 1
were 1
so 1
terribly 1
frightened 1
that 1
they 1
let 1
fall 1
what 1
they 1
had 1
in 1
their 1
hands 1
The 1
old 1
woman 1
however 1
nodded 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
said 1
Oh 1
you 1
dear 1
children 1
who 1
has 1
brought 1
you 1
here 1
do 1
come 1
in 1
and 1
stay 1
with 1
me 1
No 1
harm 1
shall 1
happen 1
to 1
you 1
She 1
took 1
them 1
both 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
led 1
them 1
into 1
her 1
little 1
house 1
Then 1
good 1
food 1
was 1
set 1
before 1
them 1
milk 1
and 1
pancakes 1
with 1
sugar 1
apples 1
and 1
nuts 1
Afterwards 1
two 1
pretty 1
little 1
beds 1
were 1
covered 1
with 1
clean 1
white 1
linen 1
and 1
Hansel 1
and 1
Gretel 1
lay 1
down 1
in 1
them 1
and 1
thought 1
they 1
were 1
in 1
heaven 1
The 1
old 1
woman 1
had 1
only 1
pretended 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
kind 1
she 1
was 1
in 1
reality 1
a 1
wicked 1
witch 1
who 1
lay 1
in 1
wait 1
for 1
children 1
and 1
had 1
only 1
built 1
the 1
little 1
house 1
of 1
bread 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
entice 1
them 1
there 1
When 1
a 1
child 1
fell 1
into 1
her 1
power 1
she 1
killed 1
it 1
cooked 1
and 1
ate 1
it 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
feast 1
day 1
with 1
her 1
Witches 1
have 1
red 1
eyes 1
and 1
cannot 1
see 1
far 1
but 1
they 1
have 1
a 1
keen 1
scent 1
like 1
the 1
beasts 1
and 1
are 1
aware 1
when 1
human 1
beings 1
draw 1
near 1
When 1
Hansel 1
and 1
Gretel 1
came 1
into 1
her 1
neighbourhood 1
she 1
laughed 1
with 1
malice 1
and 1
said 1
mockingly 1
I 1
have 1
them 1
they 1
shall 1
not 1
escape 1
me 1
again 1
Early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
before 1
the 1
children 1
were 1
awake 1
she 1
was 1
already 1
up 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
both 1
of 1
them 1
sleeping 1
and 1
looking 1
so 1
pretty 1
with 1
their 1
plump 1
and 1
rosy 1
cheeks 1
she 1
muttered 1
to 1
herself 1
That 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
dainty 1
mouthful 1
Then 1
she 1
seized 1
Hansel 1
with 1
her 1
shrivelled 1
hand 1
carried 1
him 1
into 1
a 1
little 1
stable 1
and 1
locked 1
him 1
in 1
behind 1
a 1
grated 1
door 1
Scream 1
as 1
he 1
might 1
it 1
would 1
not 1
help 1
him 1
Then 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
Gretel 1
shook 1
her 1
till 1
she 1
awoke 1
and 1
cried 1
Get 1
up 1
lazy 1
thing 1
fetch 1
some 1
water 1
and 1
cook 1
something 1
good 1
for 1
your 1
brother 1
he 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
stable 1
outside 1
and 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
made 1
fat 1
When 1
he 1
is 1
fat 1
I 1
will 1
eat 1
him 1
Gretel 1
began 1
to 1
weep 1
bitterly 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
in 1
vain 1
for 1
she 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
do 1
what 1
the 1
wicked 1
witch 1
commanded 1
And 1
now 1
the 1
best 1
food 1
was 1
cooked 1
for 1
poor 1
Hansel 1
but 1
Gretel 1
got 1
nothing 1
but 1
crab 1
shells 1
Every 1
morning 1
the 1
woman 1
crept 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
stable 1
and 1
cried 1
Hansel 1
stretch 1
out 1
your 1
finger 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
feel 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
soon 1
be 1
fat 1
Hansel 1
however 1
stretched 1
out 1
a 1
little 1
bone 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
who 1
had 1
dim 1
eyes 1
could 1
not 1
see 1
it 1
and 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
Hansel 1
s 1
finger 1
and 1
was 1
astonished 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
way 1
of 1
fattening 1
him 1
When 1
four 1
weeks 1
had 1
gone 1
by 1
and 1
Hansel 1
still 1
remained 1
thin 1
she 1
was 1
seized 1
with 1
impatience 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
wait 1
any 1
longer 1
Now 1
then 1
Gretel 1
she 1
cried 1
to 1
the 1
girl 1
stir 1
yourself 1
and 1
bring 1
some 1
water 1
Let 1
Hansel 1
be 1
fat 1
or 1
lean 1
tomorrow 1
I 1
will 1
kill 1
him 1
and 1
cook 1
him 1
Ah 1
how 1
the 1
poor 1
little 1
sister 1
did 1
lament 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
fetch 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
how 1
her 1
tears 1
did 1
flow 1
down 1
her 1
cheeks 1
Dear 1
God 1
do 1
help 1
us 1
she 1
cried 1
If 1
the 1
wild 1
beasts 1
in 1
the 1
forest 1
had 1
but 1
devoured 1
us 1
we 1
should 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
have 1
died 1
together 1
Just 1
keep 1
your 1
noise 1
to 1
yourself 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
it 1
won 1
t 1
help 1
you 1
at 1
all 1
Early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
Gretel 1
had 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
and 1
hang 1
up 1
the 1
cauldron 1
with 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
light 1
the 1
fire 1
We 1
will 1
bake 1
first 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
I 1
have 1
already 1
heated 1
the 1
oven 1
and 1
kneaded 1
the 1
dough 1
She 1
pushed 1
poor 1
Gretel 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
oven 1
from 1
which 1
flames 1
of 1
fire 1
were 1
already 1
darting 1
Creep 1
in 1
said 1
the 1
witch 1
and 1
see 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
properly 1
heated 1
so 1
that 1
we 1
can 1
put 1
the 1
bread 1
in 1
And 1
once 1
Gretel 1
was 1
inside 1
she 1
intended 1
to 1
shut 1
the 1
oven 1
and 1
let 1
her 1
bake 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
would 1
eat 1
her 1
too 1
But 1
Gretel 1
saw 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
in 1
mind 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
I 1
am 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
how 1
do 1
I 1
get 1
in 1
Silly 1
goose 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
The 1
door 1
is 1
big 1
enough 1
just 1
look 1
I 1
can 1
get 1
in 1
myself 1
and 1
she 1
crept 1
up 1
and 1
thrust 1
her 1
head 1
into 1
the 1
oven 1
Then 1
Gretel 1
gave 1
her 1
a 1
push 1
that 1
drove 1
her 1
far 1
into 1
it 1
and 1
shut 1
the 1
iron 1
door 1
and 1
fastened 1
the 1
bolt 1
Oh 1
then 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
howl 1
quite 1
horribly 1
but 1
Gretel 1
ran 1
away 1
and 1
the 1
godless 1
witch 1
was 1
miserably 1
burnt 1
to 1
death 1
Gretel 1
however 1
ran 1
like 1
lightning 1
to 1
Hansel 1
opened 1
his 1
little 1
stable 1
and 1
cried 1
Hansel 1
we 1
are 1
saved 1
The 1
old 1
witch 1
is 1
dead 1
Then 1
Hansel 1
sprang 1
like 1
a 1
bird 1
from 1
its 1
cage 1
when 1
the 1
door 1
is 1
opened 1
How 1
they 1
did 1
rejoice 1
and 1
embrace 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
dance 1
about 1
and 1
kiss 1
each 1
other 1
And 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
longer 1
any 1
need 1
to 1
fear 1
her 1
they 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
witch 1
s 1
house 1
and 1
in 1
every 1
corner 1
there 1
stood 1
chests 1
full 1
of 1
pearls 1
and 1
jewels 1
These 1
are 1
far 1
better 1
than 1
pebbles 1
said 1
Hansel 1
and 1
thrust 1
into 1
his 1
pockets 1
whatever 1
could 1
be 1
got 1
in 1
and 1
Gretel 1
said 1
I 1
too 1
will 1
take 1
something 1
home 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
filled 1
her 1
pinafore 1
full 1
But 1
now 1
we 1
must 1
be 1
off 1
said 1
Hansel 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
witch 1
s 1
forest 1
When 1
they 1
had 1
walked 1
for 1
two 1
hours 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
great 1
stretch 1
of 1
water 1
We 1
cannot 1
cross 1
said 1
Hansel 1
I 1
see 1
no 1
foot 1
plank 1
and 1
no 1
bridge 1
And 1
there 1
is 1
also 1
no 1
ferry 1
answered 1
Gretel 1
but 1
a 1
white 1
duck 1
is 1
swimming 1
there 1
if 1
I 1
ask 1
her 1
she 1
will 1
help 1
us 1
over 1
Then 1
she 1
cried 1
Little 1
duck 1
little 1
duck 1
dost 1
thou 1
see 1
Hansel 1
and 1
Gretel 1
are 1
waiting 1
for 1
thee 1
There 1
s 1
never 1
a 1
plank 1
or 1
bridge 1
in 1
sight 1
Take 1
us 1
across 1
on 1
thy 1
back 1
so 1
white 1
The 1
duck 1
came 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
Hansel 1
seated 1
himself 1
on 1
its 1
back 1
and 1
told 1
his 1
sister 1
to 1
sit 1
by 1
him 1
No 1
replied 1
Gretel 1
that 1
will 1
be 1
too 1
heavy 1
for 1
the 1
little 1
duck 1
she 1
shall 1
take 1
us 1
across 1
one 1
after 1
the 1
other 1
The 1
good 1
little 1
duck 1
did 1
so 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
once 1
safely 1
across 1
and 1
had 1
walked 1
for 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
the 1
forest 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
familiar 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
they 1
saw 1
from 1
afar 1
their 1
father 1
s 1
house 1
Then 1
they 1
began 1
to 1
run 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
parlour 1
and 1
threw 1
themselves 1
round 1
their 1
father 1
s 1
neck 1
The 1
man 1
had 1
not 1
known 1
one 1
happy 1
hour 1
since 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
the 1
children 1
in 1
the 1
forest 1
the 1
woman 1
however 1
was 1
dead 1
Gretel 1
emptied 1
her 1
pinafore 1
until 1
pearls 1
and 1
precious 1
stones 1
ran 1
about 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
Hansel 1
threw 1
one 1
handful 1
after 1
another 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
pocket 1
to 1
add 1
to 1
them 1
Then 1
all 1
anxiety 1
was 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
and 1
they 1
lived 1
together 1
in 1
perfect 1
happiness 1
My 1
tale 1
is 1
done 1
there 1
runs 1
a 1
mouse 1
whosoever 1
catches 1
it 1
may 1
make 1
himself 1
a 1
big 1
fur 1
cap 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
THE 1
MOUSE 1
THE 1
BIRD 1
AND 1
THE 1
SAUSAGE 1
Once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
a 1
mouse 1
a 1
bird 1
and 1
a 1
sausage 1
entered 1
into 1
partnership 1
and 1
set 1
up 1
house 1
together 1
For 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
all 1
went 1
well 1
they 1
lived 1
in 1
great 1
comfort 1
and 1
prospered 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
to 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
add 1
considerably 1
to 1
their 1
stores 1
The 1
bird 1
s 1
duty 1
was 1
to 1
fly 1
daily 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
and 1
bring 1
in 1
fuel 1
the 1
mouse 1
fetched 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
the 1
sausage 1
saw 1
to 1
the 1
cooking 1
When 1
people 1
are 1
too 1
well 1
off 1
they 1
always 1
begin 1
to 1
long 1
for 1
something 1
new 1
And 1
so 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
pass 1
that 1
the 1
bird 1
while 1
out 1
one 1
day 1
met 1
a 1
fellow 1
bird 1
to 1
whom 1
he 1
boastfully 1
expatiated 1
on 1
the 1
excellence 1
of 1
his 1
household 1
arrangements 1
But 1
the 1
other 1
bird 1
sneered 1
at 1
him 1
for 1
being 1
a 1
poor 1
simpleton 1
who 1
did 1
all 1
the 1
hard 1
work 1
while 1
the 1
other 1
two 1
stayed 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
time 1
of 1
it 1
For 1
when 1
the 1
mouse 1
had 1
made 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
fetched 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
she 1
could 1
retire 1
into 1
her 1
little 1
room 1
and 1
rest 1
until 1
it 1
was 1
time 1
to 1
set 1
the 1
table 1
The 1
sausage 1
had 1
only 1
to 1
watch 1
the 1
pot 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
food 1
was 1
properly 1
cooked 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
near 1
dinner 1
time 1
he 1
just 1
threw 1
himself 1
into 1
the 1
broth 1
or 1
rolled 1
in 1
and 1
out 1
among 1
the 1
vegetables 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
times 1
and 1
there 1
they 1
were 1
buttered 1
and 1
salted 1
and 1
ready 1
to 1
be 1
served 1
Then 1
when 1
the 1
bird 1
came 1
home 1
and 1
had 1
laid 1
aside 1
his 1
burden 1
they 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
table 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
finished 1
their 1
meal 1
they 1
could 1
sleep 1
their 1
fill 1
till 1
the 1
following 1
morning 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
really 1
a 1
very 1
delightful 1
life 1
Influenced 1
by 1
those 1
remarks 1
the 1
bird 1
next 1
morning 1
refused 1
to 1
bring 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
telling 1
the 1
others 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
their 1
servant 1
long 1
enough 1
and 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
fool 1
into 1
the 1
bargain 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
now 1
time 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
change 1
and 1
to 1
try 1
some 1
other 1
way 1
of 1
arranging 1
the 1
work 1
Beg 1
and 1
pray 1
as 1
the 1
mouse 1
and 1
the 1
sausage 1
might 1
it 1
was 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
the 1
bird 1
remained 1
master 1
of 1
the 1
situation 1
and 1
the 1
venture 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
made 1
They 1
therefore 1
drew 1
lots 1
and 1
it 1
fell 1
to 1
the 1
sausage 1
to 1
bring 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
to 1
the 1
mouse 1
to 1
cook 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
bird 1
to 1
fetch 1
the 1
water 1
And 1
now 1
what 1
happened 1
The 1
sausage 1
started 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
wood 1
the 1
bird 1
made 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
the 1
mouse 1
put 1
on 1
the 1
pot 1
and 1
then 1
these 1
two 1
waited 1
till 1
the 1
sausage 1
returned 1
with 1
the 1
fuel 1
for 1
the 1
following 1
day 1
But 1
the 1
sausage 1
remained 1
so 1
long 1
away 1
that 1
they 1
became 1
uneasy 1
and 1
the 1
bird 1
flew 1
out 1
to 1
meet 1
him 1
He 1
had 1
not 1
flown 1
far 1
however 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
across 1
a 1
dog 1
who 1
having 1
met 1
the 1
sausage 1
had 1
regarded 1
him 1
as 1
his 1
legitimate 1
booty 1
and 1
so 1
seized 1
and 1
swallowed 1
him 1
The 1
bird 1
complained 1
to 1
the 1
dog 1
of 1
this 1
bare 1
faced 1
robbery 1
but 1
nothing 1
he 1
said 1
was 1
of 1
any 1
avail 1
for 1
the 1
dog 1
answered 1
that 1
he 1
found 1
false 1
credentials 1
on 1
the 1
sausage 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
reason 1
his 1
life 1
had 1
been 1
forfeited 1
He 1
picked 1
up 1
the 1
wood 1
and 1
flew 1
sadly 1
home 1
and 1
told 1
the 1
mouse 1
all 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
and 1
heard 1
They 1
were 1
both 1
very 1
unhappy 1
but 1
agreed 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
things 1
and 1
to 1
remain 1
with 1
one 1
another 1
So 1
now 1
the 1
bird 1
set 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
the 1
mouse 1
looked 1
after 1
the 1
food 1
and 1
wishing 1
to 1
prepare 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
as 1
the 1
sausage 1
by 1
rolling 1
in 1
and 1
out 1
among 1
the 1
vegetables 1
to 1
salt 1
and 1
butter 1
them 1
she 1
jumped 1
into 1
the 1
pot 1
but 1
she 1
stopped 1
short 1
long 1
before 1
she 1
reached 1
the 1
bottom 1
having 1
already 1
parted 1
not 1
only 1
with 1
her 1
skin 1
and 1
hair 1
but 1
also 1
with 1
life 1
Presently 1
the 1
bird 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
serve 1
up 1
the 1
dinner 1
but 1
he 1
could 1
nowhere 1
see 1
the 1
cook 1
In 1
his 1
alarm 1
and 1
flurry 1
he 1
threw 1
the 1
wood 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
about 1
the 1
floor 1
called 1
and 1
searched 1
but 1
no 1
cook 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
Then 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
carelessly 1
thrown 1
down 1
caught 1
fire 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
blaze 1
The 1
bird 1
hastened 1
to 1
fetch 1
some 1
water 1
but 1
his 1
pail 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
he 1
after 1
it 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
recover 1
himself 1
he 1
was 1
drowned 1
MOTHER 1
HOLLE 1
Once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
widow 1
who 1
had 1
two 1
daughters 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
was 1
beautiful 1
and 1
industrious 1
the 1
other 1
ugly 1
and 1
lazy 1
The 1
mother 1
however 1
loved 1
the 1
ugly 1
and 1
lazy 1
one 1
best 1
because 1
she 1
was 1
her 1
own 1
daughter 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
other 1
who 1
was 1
only 1
her 1
stepdaughter 1
was 1
made 1
to 1
do 1
all 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
was 1
quite 1
the 1
Cinderella 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
Her 1
stepmother 1
sent 1
her 1
out 1
every 1
day 1
to 1
sit 1
by 1
the 1
well 1
in 1
the 1
high 1
road 1
there 1
to 1
spin 1
until 1
she 1
made 1
her 1
fingers 1
bleed 1
Now 1
it 1
chanced 1
one 1
day 1
that 1
some 1
blood 1
fell 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
spindle 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
girl 1
stopped 1
over 1
the 1
well 1
to 1
wash 1
it 1
off 1
the 1
spindle 1
suddenly 1
sprang 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
hand 1
and 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
well 1
She 1
ran 1
home 1
crying 1
to 1
tell 1
of 1
her 1
misfortune 1
but 1
her 1
stepmother 1
spoke 1
harshly 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
after 1
giving 1
her 1
a 1
violent 1
scolding 1
said 1
unkindly 1
As 1
you 1
have 1
let 1
the 1
spindle 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
well 1
you 1
may 1
go 1
yourself 1
and 1
fetch 1
it 1
out 1
The 1
girl 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
well 1
not 1
knowing 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
in 1
her 1
distress 1
she 1
jumped 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
after 1
the 1
spindle 1
She 1
remembered 1
nothing 1
more 1
until 1
she 1
awoke 1
and 1
found 1
herself 1
in 1
a 1
beautiful 1
meadow 1
full 1
of 1
sunshine 1
and 1
with 1
countless 1
flowers 1
blooming 1
in 1
every 1
direction 1
She 1
walked 1
over 1
the 1
meadow 1
and 1
presently 1
she 1
came 1
upon 1
a 1
baker 1
s 1
oven 1
full 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
the 1
loaves 1
cried 1
out 1
to 1
her 1
Take 1
us 1
out 1
take 1
us 1
out 1
or 1
alas 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
burnt 1
to 1
a 1
cinder 1
we 1
were 1
baked 1
through 1
long 1
ago 1
So 1
she 1
took 1
the 1
bread 1
shovel 1
and 1
drew 1
them 1
all 1
out 1
She 1
went 1
on 1
a 1
little 1
farther 1
till 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
tree 1
full 1
of 1
apples 1
Shake 1
me 1
shake 1
me 1
I 1
pray 1
cried 1
the 1
tree 1
my 1
apples 1
one 1
and 1
all 1
are 1
ripe 1
So 1
she 1
shook 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
the 1
apples 1
came 1
falling 1
down 1
upon 1
her 1
like 1
rain 1
but 1
she 1
continued 1
shaking 1
until 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
single 1
apple 1
left 1
upon 1
it 1
Then 1
she 1
carefully 1
gathered 1
the 1
apples 1
together 1
in 1
a 1
heap 1
and 1
walked 1
on 1
again 1
The 1
next 1
thing 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
house 1
and 1
there 1
she 1
saw 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
looking 1
out 1
with 1
such 1
large 1
teeth 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
terrified 1
and 1
turned 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
But 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
called 1
after 1
her 1
What 1
are 1
you 1
afraid 1
of 1
dear 1
child 1
Stay 1
with 1
me 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
do 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
my 1
house 1
properly 1
for 1
me 1
I 1
will 1
make 1
you 1
very 1
happy 1
You 1
must 1
be 1
very 1
careful 1
however 1
to 1
make 1
my 1
bed 1
in 1
the 1
right 1
way 1
for 1
I 1
wish 1
you 1
always 1
to 1
shake 1
it 1
thoroughly 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
feathers 1
fly 1
about 1
then 1
they 1
say 1
down 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
snowing 1
for 1
I 1
am 1
Mother 1
Holle 1
The 1
old 1
woman 1
spoke 1
so 1
kindly 1
that 1
the 1
girl 1
summoned 1
up 1
courage 1
and 1
agreed 1
to 1
enter 1
into 1
her 1
service 1
She 1
took 1
care 1
to 1
do 1
everything 1
according 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
s 1
bidding 1
and 1
every 1
time 1
she 1
made 1
the 1
bed 1
she 1
shook 1
it 1
with 1
all 1
her 1
might 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
feathers 1
flew 1
about 1
like 1
so 1
many 1
snowflakes 1
The 1
old 1
woman 1
was 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
her 1
word 1
she 1
never 1
spoke 1
angrily 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
gave 1
her 1
roast 1
and 1
boiled 1
meats 1
every 1
day 1
So 1
she 1
stayed 1
on 1
with 1
Mother 1
Holle 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
grow 1
unhappy 1
She 1
could 1
not 1
at 1
first 1
tell 1
why 1
she 1
felt 1
sad 1
but 1
she 1
became 1
conscious 1
at 1
last 1
of 1
great 1
longing 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
then 1
she 1
knew 1
she 1
was 1
homesick 1
although 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
thousand 1
times 1
better 1
off 1
with 1
Mother 1
Holle 1
than 1
with 1
her 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
After 1
waiting 1
awhile 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
Mother 1
Holle 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
homesick 1
that 1
I 1
cannot 1
stay 1
with 1
you 1
any 1
longer 1
for 1
although 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
happy 1
here 1
I 1
must 1
return 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
people 1
Then 1
Mother 1
Holle 1
said 1
I 1
am 1
pleased 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
your 1
own 1
people 1
and 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
served 1
me 1
so 1
well 1
and 1
faithfully 1
I 1
will 1
take 1
you 1
home 1
myself 1
Thereupon 1
she 1
led 1
the 1
girl 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
up 1
to 1
a 1
broad 1
gateway 1
The 1
gate 1
was 1
opened 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
girl 1
passed 1
through 1
a 1
shower 1
of 1
gold 1
fell 1
upon 1
her 1
and 1
the 1
gold 1
clung 1
to 1
her 1
so 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
covered 1
with 1
it 1
from 1
head 1
to 1
foot 1
That 1
is 1
a 1
reward 1
for 1
your 1
industry 1
said 1
Mother 1
Holle 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
spoke 1
she 1
handed 1
her 1
the 1
spindle 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
dropped 1
into 1
the 1
well 1
The 1
gate 1
was 1
then 1
closed 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
found 1
herself 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
world 1
close 1
to 1
her 1
mother 1
s 1
house 1
As 1
she 1
entered 1
the 1
courtyard 1
the 1
cock 1
who 1
was 1
perched 1
on 1
the 1
well 1
called 1
out 1
Cock 1
a 1
doodle 1
doo 1
Your 1
golden 1
daughter 1
s 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
you 1
Then 1
she 1
went 1
in 1
to 1
her 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
richly 1
covered 1
with 1
gold 1
they 1
gave 1
her 1
a 1
warm 1
welcome 1
She 1
related 1
to 1
them 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
happened 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
mother 1
heard 1
how 1
she 1
had 1
come 1
by 1
her 1
great 1
riches 1
she 1
thought 1
she 1
should 1
like 1
her 1
ugly 1
lazy 1
daughter 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
try 1
her 1
fortune 1
So 1
she 1
made 1
the 1
sister 1
go 1
and 1
sit 1
by 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
spin 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
pricked 1
her 1
finger 1
and 1
thrust 1
her 1
hand 1
into 1
a 1
thorn 1
bush 1
so 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
drop 1
some 1
blood 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
spindle 1
then 1
she 1
threw 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
jumped 1
in 1
herself 1
Like 1
her 1
sister 1
she 1
awoke 1
in 1
the 1
beautiful 1
meadow 1
and 1
walked 1
over 1
it 1
till 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
oven 1
Take 1
us 1
out 1
take 1
us 1
out 1
or 1
alas 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
burnt 1
to 1
a 1
cinder 1
we 1
were 1
baked 1
through 1
long 1
ago 1
cried 1
the 1
loaves 1
as 1
before 1
But 1
the 1
lazy 1
girl 1
answered 1
Do 1
you 1
think 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
dirty 1
my 1
hands 1
for 1
you 1
and 1
walked 1
on 1
Presently 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
apple 1
tree 1
Shake 1
me 1
shake 1
me 1
I 1
pray 1
my 1
apples 1
one 1
and 1
all 1
are 1
ripe 1
it 1
cried 1
But 1
she 1
only 1
answered 1
A 1
nice 1
thing 1
to 1
ask 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
apples 1
might 1
fall 1
on 1
my 1
head 1
and 1
passed 1
on 1
At 1
last 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
Mother 1
Holle 1
s 1
house 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
heard 1
all 1
about 1
the 1
large 1
teeth 1
from 1
her 1
sister 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
afraid 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
engaged 1
herself 1
without 1
delay 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
The 1
first 1
day 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
obedient 1
and 1
industrious 1
and 1
exerted 1
herself 1
to 1
please 1
Mother 1
Holle 1
for 1
she 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
gold 1
she 1
should 1
get 1
in 1
return 1
The 1
next 1
day 1
however 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
dawdle 1
over 1
her 1
work 1
and 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
she 1
was 1
more 1
idle 1
still 1
then 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
lie 1
in 1
bed 1
in 1
the 1
mornings 1
and 1
refused 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
Worse 1
still 1
she 1
neglected 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
s 1
bed 1
properly 1
and 1
forgot 1
to 1
shake 1
it 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
feathers 1
might 1
fly 1
about 1
So 1
Mother 1
Holle 1
very 1
soon 1
got 1
tired 1
of 1
her 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
she 1
might 1
go 1
The 1
lazy 1
girl 1
was 1
delighted 1
at 1
this 1
and 1
thought 1
to 1
herself 1
The 1
gold 1
will 1
soon 1
be 1
mine 1
Mother 1
Holle 1
led 1
her 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
led 1
her 1
sister 1
to 1
the 1
broad 1
gateway 1
but 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
passing 1
through 1
instead 1
of 1
the 1
shower 1
of 1
gold 1
a 1
great 1
bucketful 1
of 1
pitch 1
came 1
pouring 1
over 1
her 1
That 1
is 1
in 1
return 1
for 1
your 1
services 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
and 1
she 1
shut 1
the 1
gate 1
So 1
the 1
lazy 1
girl 1
had 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
covered 1
with 1
pitch 1
and 1
the 1
cock 1
on 1
the 1
well 1
called 1
out 1
as 1
she 1
saw 1
her 1
Cock 1
a 1
doodle 1
doo 1
Your 1
dirty 1
daughter 1
s 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
you 1
But 1
try 1
what 1
she 1
would 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
get 1
the 1
pitch 1
off 1
and 1
it 1
stuck 1
to 1
her 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
she 1
lived 1
LITTLE 1
RED 1

LITTLE 1
RED 1
RIDING 1
HOOD 1
Once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
dear 1
little 1
girl 1
who 1
was 1
loved 1
by 1
everyone 1
who 1
looked 1
at 1
her 1
but 1
most 1
of 1
all 1
by 1
her 1
grandmother 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
given 1
to 1
the 1
child 1
Once 1
she 1
gave 1
her 1
a 1
little 1
cap 1
of 1
red 1
velvet 1
which 1
suited 1
her 1
so 1
well 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
never 1
wear 1
anything 1
else 1
so 1
she 1
was 1
always 1
called 1
Little 1
Red 1
Cap 1
One 1
day 1
her 1
mother 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
Come 1
Little 1
Red 1
Cap 1
here 1
is 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
cake 1
and 1
a 1
bottle 1
of 1
wine 1
take 1
them 1
to 1
your 1
grandmother 1
she 1
is 1
ill 1
and 1
weak 1
and 1
they 1
will 1
do 1
her 1
good 1
Set 1
out 1
before 1
it 1
gets 1
hot 1
and 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
going 1
walk 1
nicely 1
and 1
quietly 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
run 1
off 1
the 1
path 1
or 1
you 1
may 1
fall 1
and 1
break 1
the 1
bottle 1
and 1
then 1
your 1
grandmother 1
will 1
get 1
nothing 1
and 1
when 1
you 1
go 1
into 1
her 1
room 1
don 1
t 1
forget 1
to 1
say 1
Good 1
morning 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
peep 1
into 1
every 1
corner 1
before 1
you 1
do 1
it 1
I 1
will 1
take 1
great 1
care 1
said 1
Little 1
Red 1
Cap 1
to 1
her 1
mother 1
and 1
gave 1
her 1
hand 1
on 1
it 1
The 1
grandmother 1
lived 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
half 1
a 1
league 1
from 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
just 1
as 1
Little 1
Red 1
Cap 1
entered 1
the 1
wood 1
a 1
wolf 1
met 1
her 1
Red 1
Cap 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
a 1
wicked 1
creature 1
he 1
was 1
and 1
was 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
afraid 1
of 1
him 1
Good 1
day 1
Little 1
Red 1
Cap 1
said 1
he 1
Thank 1
you 1
kindly 1
wolf 1
Whither 1
away 1
so 1
early 1
Little 1
Red 1

To 1
my 1
grandmother 1
s 1
What 1
have 1
you 1
got 1
in 1
your 1
apron 1
Cake 1
and 1
wine 1
yesterday 1
was 1
baking 1
day 1
so 1
poor 1
sick 1
grandmother 1
is 1
to 1
have 1
something 1
good 1
to 1
make 1
her 1
stronger 1
Where 1
does 1
your 1
grandmother 1
live 1
Little 1
Red 1
Cap 1
A 1
good 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
league 1
farther 1
on 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
her 1
house 1
stands 1
under 1
the 1
three 1
large 1
oak 1
trees 1
the 1
nut 1
trees 1
are 1
just 1
below 1
you 1
surely 1
must 1
know 1
it 1
replied 1
Little 1
Red 1
Cap 1
The 1
wolf 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
What 1
a 1
tender 1
young 1
creature 1
what 1
a 1
nice 1
plump 1
mouthful 1
she 1
will 1
be 1
better 1
to 1
eat 1
than 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
I 1
must 1
act 1
craftily 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
catch 1
both 1
So 1
he 1
walked 1
for 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
Little 1
Red 1
Cap 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
See 1
Little 1
Red 1
Cap 1
how 1
pretty 1
the 1
flowers 1
are 1
about 1
here 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
look 1
round 1
I 1
believe 1
too 1
that 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
hear 1
how 1
sweetly 1
the 1
little 1
birds 1
are 1
singing 1
you 1
walk 1
gravely 1
along 1
as 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
school 1
while 1
everything 1
else 1
out 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
is 1
merry 1
Little 1
Red 1
Cap 1
raised 1
her 1
eyes 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
sunbeams 1
dancing 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
through 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
pretty 1
flowers 1
growing 1
everywhere 1
she 1
thought 1
Suppose 1
I 1
take 1
grandmother 1
a 1
fresh 1
nosegay 1
that 1
would 1
please 1
her 1
too 1
It 1
is 1
so 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
day 1
that 1
I 1
shall 1
still 1
get 1
there 1
in 1
good 1
time 1
and 1
so 1
she 1
ran 1
from 1
the 1
path 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
to 1
look 1
for 1
flowers 1
And 1
whenever 1
she 1
had 1
picked 1
one 1
she 1
fancied 1
that 1
she 1
saw 1
a 1
still 1
prettier 1
one 1
farther 1
on 1
and 1
ran 1
after 1
it 1
and 1
so 1
got 1
deeper 1
and 1
deeper 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
Meanwhile 1
the 1
wolf 1
ran 1
straight 1
to 1
the 1
grandmother 1
s 1
house 1
and 1
knocked 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
Who 1
is 1
there 1
Little 1
Red 1
Cap 1
replied 1
the 1
wolf 1
She 1
is 1
bringing 1
cake 1
and 1
wine 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
Lift 1
the 1
latch 1
called 1
out 1
the 1
grandmother 1
I 1
am 1
too 1
weak 1
and 1
cannot 1
get 1
up 1
The 1
wolf 1
lifted 1
the 1
latch 1
the 1
door 1
sprang 1
open 1
and 1
without 1
saying 1
a 1
word 1
he 1
went 1
straight 1
to 1
the 1
grandmother 1
s 1
bed 1
and 1
devoured 1
her 1
Then 1
he 1
put 1
on 1
her 1
clothes 1
dressed 1
himself 1
in 1
her 1
cap 1
laid 1
himself 1
in 1
bed 1
and 1
drew 1
the 1
curtains 1
Little 1
Red 1
Cap 1
however 1
had 1
been 1
running 1
about 1
picking 1
flowers 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
gathered 1
so 1
many 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
carry 1
no 1
more 1
she 1
remembered 1
her 1
grandmother 1
and 1
set 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
her 1
She 1
was 1
surprised 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
cottage 1
door 1
standing 1
open 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
she 1
had 1
such 1
a 1
strange 1
feeling 1
that 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
herself 1
Oh 1
dear 1
how 1
uneasy 1
I 1
feel 1
today 1
and 1
at 1
other 1
times 1
I 1
like 1
being 1
with 1
grandmother 1
so 1
much 1
She 1
called 1
out 1
Good 1
morning 1
but 1
received 1
no 1
answer 1
so 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
bed 1
and 1
drew 1
back 1
the 1
curtains 1
There 1
lay 1
her 1
grandmother 1
with 1
her 1
cap 1
pulled 1
far 1
over 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
looking 1
very 1
strange 1
Oh 1
grandmother 1
she 1
said 1
what 1
big 1
ears 1
you 1
have 1
The 1
better 1
to 1
hear 1
you 1
with 1
my 1
child 1
was 1
the 1
reply 1
But 1
grandmother 1
what 1
big 1
eyes 1
you 1
have 1
she 1
said 1
The 1
better 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
with 1
my 1
dear 1
But 1
grandmother 1
what 1
large 1
hands 1
you 1
have 1
The 1
better 1
to 1
hug 1
you 1
with 1
Oh 1
but 1
grandmother 1
what 1
a 1
terrible 1
big 1
mouth 1
you 1
have 1
The 1
better 1
to 1
eat 1
you 1
with 1
And 1
scarcely 1
had 1
the 1
wolf 1
said 1
this 1
than 1
with 1
one 1
bound 1
he 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
and 1
swallowed 1
up 1
Red 1
Cap 1
When 1
the 1
wolf 1
had 1
appeased 1
his 1
appetite 1
he 1
lay 1
down 1
again 1
in 1
the 1
bed 1
fell 1
asleep 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
snore 1
very 1
loud 1
The 1
huntsman 1
was 1
just 1
passing 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
How 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
is 1
snoring 1
I 1
must 1
just 1
see 1
if 1
she 1
wants 1
anything 1
So 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
bed 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
wolf 1
was 1
lying 1
in 1
it 1
Do 1
I 1
find 1
you 1
here 1
you 1
old 1
sinner 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
have 1
long 1
sought 1
you 1
Then 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
fire 1
at 1
him 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
wolf 1
might 1
have 1
devoured 1
the 1
grandmother 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
still 1
be 1
saved 1
so 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
fire 1
but 1
took 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
scissors 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
cut 1
open 1
the 1
stomach 1
of 1
the 1
sleeping 1
wolf 1
When 1
he 1
had 1
made 1
two 1
snips 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
little 1
Red 1
Cap 1
shining 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
made 1
two 1
snips 1
more 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
girl 1
sprang 1
out 1
crying 1
Ah 1
how 1
frightened 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
How 1
dark 1
it 1
was 1
inside 1
the 1
wolf 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
the 1
aged 1
grandmother 1
came 1
out 1
alive 1
also 1
but 1
scarcely 1
able 1
to 1
breathe 1
Red 1
Cap 1
however 1
quickly 1
fetched 1
great 1
stones 1
with 1
which 1
they 1
filled 1
the 1
wolf 1
s 1
belly 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
awoke 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
but 1
the 1
stones 1
were 1
so 1
heavy 1
that 1
he 1
collapsed 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
fell 1
dead 1
Then 1
all 1
three 1
were 1
delighted 1
The 1
huntsman 1
drew 1
off 1
the 1
wolf 1
s 1
skin 1
and 1
went 1
home 1
with 1
it 1
the 1
grandmother 1
ate 1
the 1
cake 1
and 1
drank 1
the 1
wine 1
which 1
Red 1
Cap 1
had 1
brought 1
and 1
revived 1
but 1
Red 1
Cap 1
thought 1
to 1
herself 1
As 1
long 1
as 1
I 1
live 1
I 1
will 1
never 1
by 1
myself 1
leave 1
the 1
path 1
to 1
run 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
when 1
my 1
mother 1
has 1
forbidden 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
It 1
also 1
related 1
that 1
once 1
when 1
Red 1
Cap 1
was 1
again 1
taking 1
cakes 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
grandmother 1
another 1
wolf 1
spoke 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
entice 1
her 1
from 1
the 1
path 1
Red 1
Cap 1
however 1
was 1
on 1
her 1
guard 1
and 1
went 1
straight 1
forward 1
on 1
her 1
way 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
grandmother 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
met 1
the 1
wolf 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
said 1
good 1
morning 1
to 1
her 1
but 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
wicked 1
look 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
that 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
on 1
the 1
public 1
road 1
she 1
was 1
certain 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
eaten 1
her 1
up 1
Well 1
said 1
the 1
grandmother 1
we 1
will 1
shut 1
the 1
door 1
that 1
he 1
may 1
not 1
come 1
in 1
Soon 1
afterwards 1
the 1
wolf 1
knocked 1
and 1
cried 1
Open 1
the 1
door 1
grandmother 1
I 1
am 1
Little 1
Red 1
Cap 1
and 1
am 1
bringing 1
you 1
some 1
cakes 1
But 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
speak 1
or 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
so 1
the 1
grey 1
beard 1
stole 1
twice 1
or 1
thrice 1
round 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
jumped 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
intending 1
to 1
wait 1
until 1
Red 1
Cap 1
went 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
steal 1
after 1
her 1
and 1
devour 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
But 1
the 1
grandmother 1
saw 1
what 1
was 1
in 1
his 1
thoughts 1
In 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
stone 1
trough 1
so 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
child 1
Take 1
the 1
pail 1
Red 1
Cap 1
I 1
made 1
some 1
sausages 1
yesterday 1
so 1
carry 1
the 1
water 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
boiled 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
trough 1
Red 1
Cap 1
carried 1
until 1
the 1
great 1
trough 1
was 1
quite 1
full 1
Then 1
the 1
smell 1
of 1
the 1
sausages 1
reached 1
the 1
wolf 1
and 1
he 1
sniffed 1
and 1
peeped 1
down 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
stretched 1
out 1
his 1
neck 1
so 1
far 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
keep 1
his 1
footing 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
slip 1
and 1
slipped 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
roof 1
straight 1
into 1
the 1
great 1
trough 1
and 1
was 1
drowned 1
But 1
Red 1
Cap 1
went 1
joyously 1
home 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
ever 1
did 1
anything 1
to 1
harm 1
her 1
again 1
THE 1
ROBBER 1
BRIDEGROOM 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
miller 1
who 1
had 1
one 1
beautiful 1
daughter 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
grown 1
up 1
he 1
was 1
anxious 1
that 1
she 1
should 1
be 1
well 1
married 1
and 1
provided 1
for 1
He 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
first 1
suitable 1
man 1
who 1
comes 1
and 1
asks 1
for 1
her 1
hand 1
Not 1
long 1
after 1
a 1
suitor 1
appeared 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
very 1
rich 1
and 1
the 1
miller 1
could 1
see 1
nothing 1
in 1
him 1
with 1
which 1
to 1
find 1
fault 1
he 1
betrothed 1
his 1
daughter 1
to 1
him 1
But 1
the 1
girl 1
did 1
not 1
care 1
for 1
the 1
man 1
as 1
a 1
girl 1
ought 1
to 1
care 1
for 1
her 1
betrothed 1
husband 1
She 1
did 1
not 1
feel 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
trust 1
him 1
and 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
look 1
at 1
him 1
nor 1
think 1
of 1
him 1
without 1
an 1
inward 1
shudder 1
One 1
day 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
You 1
have 1
not 1
yet 1
paid 1
me 1
a 1
visit 1
although 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
betrothed 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
where 1
your 1
house 1
is 1
she 1
answered 1
My 1
house 1
is 1
out 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
forest 1
he 1
said 1
She 1
tried 1
to 1
excuse 1
herself 1
by 1
saying 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
way 1
thither 1
Her 1
betrothed 1
only 1
replied 1
You 1
must 1
come 1
and 1
see 1
me 1
next 1
Sunday 1
I 1
have 1
already 1
invited 1
guests 1
for 1
that 1
day 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
not 1
mistake 1
the 1
way 1
I 1
will 1
strew 1
ashes 1
along 1
the 1
path 1
When 1
Sunday 1
came 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
time 1
for 1
the 1
girl 1
to 1
start 1
a 1
feeling 1
of 1
dread 1
came 1
over 1
her 1
which 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
explain 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
find 1
her 1
path 1
again 1
she 1
filled 1
her 1
pockets 1
with 1
peas 1
and 1
lentils 1
to 1
sprinkle 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
as 1
she 1
went 1
along 1
On 1
reaching 1
the 1
entrance 1
to 1
the 1
forest 1
she 1
found 1
the 1
path 1
strewed 1
with 1
ashes 1
and 1
these 1
she 1
followed 1
throwing 1
down 1
some 1
peas 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
her 1
at 1
every 1
step 1
she 1
took 1
She 1
walked 1
the 1
whole 1
day 1
until 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
deepest 1
darkest 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
There 1
she 1
saw 1
a 1
lonely 1
house 1
looking 1
so 1
grim 1
and 1
mysterious 1
that 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
please 1
her 1
at 1
all 1
She 1
stepped 1
inside 1
but 1
not 1
a 1
soul 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
and 1
a 1
great 1
silence 1
reigned 1
throughout 1
Suddenly 1
a 1
voice 1
cried 1
Turn 1
back 1
turn 1
back 1
young 1
maiden 1
fair 1
Linger 1
not 1
in 1
this 1
murderers 1
lair 1
The 1
girl 1
looked 1
up 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
voice 1
came 1
from 1
a 1
bird 1
hanging 1
in 1
a 1
cage 1
on 1
the 1
wall 1
Again 1
it 1
cried 1
Turn 1
back 1
turn 1
back 1
young 1
maiden 1
fair 1
Linger 1
not 1
in 1
this 1
murderers 1
lair 1
The 1
girl 1
passed 1
on 1
going 1
from 1
room 1
to 1
room 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
empty 1
and 1
still 1
she 1
saw 1
no 1
one 1
At 1
last 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
cellar 1
and 1
there 1
sat 1
a 1
very 2
old 1
woman 1
who 1
could 1
not 1
keep 1
her 1
head 1
from 1
shaking 1
Can 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
asked 1
the 1
girl 1
if 1
my 1
betrothed 1
husband 1
lives 1
here 1
Ah 1
you 1
poor 1
child 1
answered 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
what 1
a 1
place 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
This 1
is 1
a 1
murderers 1
den 1
You 1
think 1
yourself 1
a 1
promised 1
bride 1
and 1
that 1
your 1
marriage 1
will 1
soon 1
take 1
place 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
with 1
death 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
keep 1
your 1
marriage 1
feast 1
Look 1
do 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
large 1
cauldron 1
of 1
water 1
which 1
I 1
am 1
obliged 1
to 1
keep 1
on 1
the 1
fire 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
they 1
have 1
you 1
in 1
their 1
power 1
they 1
will 1
kill 1
you 1
without 1
mercy 1
and 1
cook 1
and 1
eat 1
you 1
for 1
they 1
are 1
eaters 1
of 1
men 1
If 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
take 1
pity 1
on 1
you 1
and 1
save 1
you 2
would 1
be 1
lost 1
Thereupon 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
led 1
her 1
behind 1
a 1
large 1
cask 1
which 1
quite 1
hid 1
her 1
from 1
view 1
Keep 1
as 1
still 1
as 1
a 1
mouse 1
she 1
said 1
do 1
not 1
move 1
or 1
speak 1
or 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
all 1
over 1
with 1
you 1
Tonight 1
when 1
the 1
robbers 1
are 1
all 1
asleep 1
we 1
will 1
flee 1
together 1
I 1
have 1
long 1
been 1
waiting 1
for 1
an 1
opportunity 1
to 1
escape 1
The 1
words 1
were 1
hardly 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
mouth 1
when 1
the 1
godless 1
crew 1
returned 1
dragging 1
another 1
young 1
girl 1
along 1
with 1
them 1
They 1
were 1
all 1
drunk 1
and 1
paid 1
no 1
heed 1
to 1
her 1
cries 1
and 1
lamentations 1
They 1
gave 1
her 1
wine 1
to 1
drink 1
three 1
glasses 1
full 1
one 1
of 1
white 1
wine 1
one 1
of 1
red 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
yellow 1
and 1
with 1
that 1
her 1
heart 1
gave 1
way 1
and 1
she 1
died 1
Then 1
they 1
tore 1
off 1
her 1
dainty 1
clothing 1
laid 1
her 1
on 1
a 1
table 1
and 1
cut 1
her 1
beautiful 1
body 1
into 1
pieces 1
and 1
sprinkled 1
salt 1
upon 1
it 1
The 1
poor 1
betrothed 1
girl 1
crouched 1
trembling 1
and 1
shuddering 1
behind 1
the 1
cask 1
for 1
she 1
saw 1
what 1
a 1
terrible 1
fate 1
had 1
been 1
intended 1
for 1
her 1
by 1
the 1
robbers 1
One 1
of 1
them 1
now 1
noticed 1
a 1
gold 1
ring 1
still 1
remaining 1
on 1
the 1
little 1
finger 1
of 1
the 1
murdered 1
girl 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
draw 1
it 1
off 1
easily 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
hatchet 1
and 1
cut 1
off 1
the 1
finger 1
but 1
the 1
finger 1
sprang 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
fell 1
behind 1
the 1
cask 1
into 1
the 1
lap 1
of 1
the 1
girl 1
who 1
was 1
hiding 1
there 1
The 1
robber 1
took 1
a 1
light 1
and 1
began 1
looking 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
it 1
Have 1
you 1
looked 1
behind 1
the 1
large 1
cask 1
said 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
others 1
But 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
called 1
out 1
Come 1
and 1
eat 1
your 1
suppers 1
and 1
let 1
the 1
thing 1
be 1
till 1
tomorrow 1
the 1
finger 1
won 1
t 1
run 1
away 1
The 1
old 1
woman 1
is 1
right 1
said 1
the 1
robbers 1
and 1
they 1
ceased 1
looking 1
for 1
the 1
finger 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
The 1
old 1
woman 1
then 1
mixed 1
a 1
sleeping 1
draught 1
with 1
their 1
wine 1
and 1
before 1
long 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
of 1
the 1
cellar 1
fast 1
asleep 1
and 1
snoring 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
girl 1
was 1
assured 1
of 1
this 1
she 1
came 1
from 1
behind 1
the 1
cask 1
She 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
step 1
over 1
the 1
bodies 1
of 1
the 1
sleepers 1
who 1
were 1
lying 1
close 1
together 1
and 1
every 1
moment 1
she 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
renewed 1
dread 1
lest 1
she 1
should 1
awaken 1
them 1
But 1
God 1
helped 1
her 1
so 1
that 1
she 1
passed 1
safely 1
over 1
them 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
went 1
upstairs 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
hastened 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
from 1
the 1
murderers 1
den 1
They 1
found 1
the 1
ashes 1
scattered 1
by 1
the 1
wind 1
but 1
the 1
peas 1
and 1
lentils 1
had 1
sprouted 1
and 1
grown 1
sufficiently 1
above 1
the 1
ground 1
to 1
guide 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
moonlight 1
along 1
the 1
path 1
All 1
night 1
long 1
they 1
walked 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
morning 1
before 1
they 1
reached 1
the 1
mill 1
Then 1
the 1
girl 1
told 1
her 1
father 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
happened 1
The 1
day 1
came 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
fixed 1
for 1
the 1
marriage 1
The 1
bridegroom 1
arrived 1
and 1
also 1
a 1
large 1
company 1
of 1
guests 1
for 1
the 1
miller 1
had 1
taken 1
care 1
to 1
invite 1
all 1
his 1
friends 1
and 1
relations 1
As 1
they 1
sat 1
at 1
the 1
feast 1
each 1
guest 1
in 1
turn 1
was 1
asked 1
to 1
tell 1
a 1
tale 1
the 1
bride 1
sat 1
still 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
say 1
a 1
word 1
And 1
you 1
my 1
love 1
said 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
turning 1
to 1
her 1
is 1
there 1
no 1
tale 1
you 1
know 1
Tell 1
us 1
something 1
I 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
a 1
dream 1
then 1
said 1
the 1
bride 1
I 1
went 1
alone 1
through 1
a 1
forest 1
and 1
came 1
at 1
last 1
to 1
a 1
house 1
not 1
a 1
soul 1
could 1
I 1
find 1
within 1
but 1
a 1
bird 1
that 1
was 1
hanging 1
in 1
a 1
cage 1
on 1
the 1
wall 1
cried 1
Turn 1
back 1
turn 1
back 1
young 1
maiden 1
fair 1
Linger 1
not 1
in 1
this 1
murderers 1
lair 1
and 1
again 1
a 1
second 1
time 1
it 1
said 1
these 1
words 1
My 1
darling 1
this 1
is 1
only 1
a 1
dream 1
I 1
went 1
on 1
through 1
the 1
house 1
from 1
room 1
to 1
room 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
empty 1
and 1
everything 1
was 1
so 1
grim 1
and 1
mysterious 1
At 1
last 1
I 1
went 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
cellar 1
and 1
there 1
sat 1
a 1
very 2
old 1
woman 1
who 1
could 1
not 1
keep 1
her 1
head 1
still 1
I 1
asked 1
her 1
if 1
my 1
betrothed 1
lived 1
here 1
and 1
she 1
answered 1
Ah 1
you 1
poor 1
child 1
you 1
are 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
murderers 1
den 1
your 1
betrothed 1
does 1
indeed 1
live 1
here 1
but 1
he 1
will 1
kill 1
you 1
without 1
mercy 1
and 1
afterwards 1
cook 1
and 1
eat 1
you 1
My 1
darling 1
this 1
is 1
only 1
a 1
dream 1
The 1
old 1
woman 1
hid 1
me 1
behind 1
a 1
large 1
cask 1
and 1
scarcely 1
had 1
she 1
done 1
this 1
when 1
the 1
robbers 1
returned 1
home 1
dragging 1
a 1
young 1
girl 1
along 1
with 1
them 1
They 1
gave 1
her 1
three 1
kinds 1
of 1
wine 1
to 1
drink 1
white 1
red 1
and 1
yellow 1
and 1
with 1
that 1
she 1
died 1
My 1
darling 1
this 1
is 1
only 1
a 1
dream 1
Then 1
they 1
tore 1
off 1
her 1
dainty 1
clothing 1
and 1
cut 1
her 1
beautiful 1
body 1
into 1
pieces 1
and 1
sprinkled 1
salt 1
upon 1
it 1
My 1
darling 1
this 1
is 1
only 1
a 1
dream 1
And 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
robbers 1
saw 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
gold 1
ring 1
still 1
left 1
on 1
her 1
finger 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
difficult 1
to 1
draw 1
off 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
hatchet 1
and 1
cut 1
off 1
her 1
finger 1
but 1
the 1
finger 1
sprang 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
fell 1
behind 1
the 1
great 1
cask 1
into 1
my 1
lap 1
And 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
finger 1
with 1
the 1
ring 1
And 1
with 1
these 1
words 1
the 1
bride 1
drew 1
forth 1
the 1
finger 1
and 1
shewed 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
assembled 1
guests 1
The 1
bridegroom 1
who 1
during 1
this 1
recital 1
had 1
grown 1
deadly 1
pale 1
up 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
escape 1
but 1
the 1
guests 1
seized 1
him 1
and 1
held 1
him 1
fast 1
They 1
delivered 1
him 1
up 1
to 1
justice 1
and 1
he 1
and 1
all 1
his 1
murderous 1
band 1
were 1
condemned 1
to 1
death 1
for 1
their 1
wicked 1
deeds 1
TOM 1
THUMB 1
A 1
poor 1
woodman 1
sat 1
in 1
his 1
cottage 1
one 1
night 1
smoking 1
his 1
pipe 1
by 1
the 1
fireside 1
while 1
his 1
wife 1
sat 1
by 1
his 1
side 1
spinning 1
How 1
lonely 1
it 1
is 1
wife 1
said 1
he 1
as 1
he 1
puffed 1
out 1
a 1
long 1
curl 1
of 1
smoke 1
for 1
you 1
and 1
me 1
to 1
sit 1
here 1
by 1
ourselves 1
without 1
any 1
children 1
to 1
play 1
about 1
and 1
amuse 1
us 1
while 1
other 1
people 1
seem 1
so 1
happy 1
and 1
merry 1
with 1
their 1
children 1
What 1
you 1
say 1
is 1
very 1
true 1
said 1
the 1
wife 1
sighing 1
and 1
turning 1
round 1
her 1
wheel 1
how 1
happy 1
should 1
I 1
be 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
but 1
one 1
child 1
If 1
it 1
were 1
ever 1
so 1
small 1
nay 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
no 1
bigger 1
than 1
my 1
thumb 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
very 1
happy 1
and 1
love 1
it 1
dearly 1
Now 1
odd 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
think 1
it 2
came 1
to 1
pass 1
that 1
this 1
good 1
woman 1
s 1
wish 1
was 1
fulfilled 1
just 1
in 1
the 1
very 1
way 1
she 1
had 1
wished 1
it 1
for 1
not 1
long 1
afterwards 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
little 1
boy 1
who 1
was 1
quite 1
healthy 1
and 1
strong 1
but 1
was 1
not 1
much 1
bigger 1
than 1
my 1
thumb 1
So 1
they 1
said 1
Well 1
we 1
cannot 1
say 1
we 1
have 1
not 1
got 1
what 1
we 1
wished 1
for 1
and 1
little 1
as 1
he 1
is 1
we 1
will 1
love 1
him 1
dearly 1
And 1
they 1
called 1
him 1
Thomas 1
Thumb 1
They 1
gave 1
him 1
plenty 1
of 1
food 1
yet 1
for 1
all 1
they 1
could 1
do 1
he 1
never 1
grew 1
bigger 1
but 1
kept 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
size 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
born 1
Still 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
sharp 1
and 1
sparkling 1
and 1
he 1
soon 1
showed 1
himself 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
clever 1
little 1
fellow 1
who 1
always 1
knew 1
well 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
about 1
One 1
day 1
as 1
the 1
woodman 1
was 1
getting 1
ready 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
to 1
cut 1
fuel 1
he 1
said 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
had 1
someone 1
to 1
bring 1
the 1
cart 1
after 1
me 1
for 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
make 1
haste 1
Oh 1
father 1
cried 1
Tom 1
I 1
will 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
that 1
the 1
cart 1
shall 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
you 1
want 1
it 1
Then 1
the 1
woodman 1
laughed 1
and 1
said 1
How 1
can 1
that 1
be 1
you 1
cannot 1
reach 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
horse 1
s 1
bridle 1
Never 1
mind 1
that 1
father 1
said 1
Tom 1
if 1
my 1
mother 1
will 1
only 1
harness 1
the 1
horse 1
I 1
will 1
get 1
into 1
his 1
ear 1
and 1
tell 1
him 1
which 1
way 1
to 1
go 1
Well 1
said 1
the 1
father 1
we 1
will 1
try 1
for 1
once 1
When 1
the 1
time 1
came 1
the 1
mother 1
harnessed 1
the 1
horse 1
to 1
the 1
cart 1
and 1
put 1
Tom 1
into 1
his 1
ear 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
sat 1
there 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
told 1
the 1
beast 1
how 1
to 1
go 1
crying 1
out 1
Go 1
on 1
and 1
Stop 1
as 1
he 1
wanted 1
and 1
thus 1
the 1
horse 1
went 1
on 1
just 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
woodman 1
had 1
driven 1
it 1
himself 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
It 1
happened 1
that 1
as 1
the 1
horse 1
was 1
going 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
fast 1
and 1
Tom 1
was 1
calling 1
out 1
Gently 1
gently 1
two 1
strangers 1
came 1
up 1
What 1
an 1
odd 1
thing 1
that 1
is 1
said 1
one 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
cart 1
going 1
along 1
and 1
I 1
hear 1
a 1
carter 1
talking 1
to 1
the 1
horse 1
but 1
yet 1
I 1
can 1
see 1
no 1
one 1
That 1
is 1
queer 1
indeed 1
said 1
the 1
other 1
let 1
us 1
follow 1
the 1
cart 1
and 1
see 1
where 1
it 1
goes 1
So 1
they 1
went 1
on 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
the 1
woodman 1
was 1
Then 1
Tom 1
Thumb 1
seeing 1
his 1
father 1
cried 1
out 1
See 1
father 1
here 1
I 1
am 1
with 1
the 1
cart 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
safe 1
now 1
take 1
me 1
down 1
So 1
his 1
father 1
took 1
hold 1
of 1
the 1
horse 1
with 1
one 1
hand 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
other 1
took 1
his 1
son 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
horse 1
s 1
ear 1
and 1
put 1
him 1
down 1
upon 1
a 1
straw 1
where 1
he 1
sat 1
as 1
merry 1
as 1
you 1
please 1
The 1
two 1
strangers 1
were 1
all 1
this 1
time 1
looking 1
on 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
for 1
wonder 1
At 1
last 1
one 1
took 1
the 1
other 1
aside 1
and 1
said 1
That 1
little 1
urchin 1
will 1
make 1
our 1
fortune 1
if 1
we 1
can 1
get 1
him 1
and 1
carry 1
him 1
about 1
from 1
town 1
to 1
town 1
as 1
a 1
show 1
we 1
must 1
buy 1
him 1
So 1
they 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
woodman 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
what 1
he 1
would 1
take 1
for 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
He 1
will 1
be 1
better 1
off 1
said 1
they 1
with 1
us 1
than 1
with 1
you 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
sell 1
him 1
at 1
all 1
said 1
the 1
father 1
my 1
own 1
flesh 1
and 1
blood 1
is 1
dearer 1
to 1
me 1
than 1
all 1
the 1
silver 1
and 1
gold 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
But 1
Tom 1
hearing 1
of 1
the 1
bargain 1
they 1
wanted 1
to 1
make 1
crept 1
up 1
his 1
father 1
s 1
coat 1
to 1
his 1
shoulder 1
and 1
whispered 1
in 1
his 1
ear 1
Take 1
the 1
money 1
father 1
and 1
let 1
them 1
have 1
me 1
I 1
ll 1
soon 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
you 1
So 1
the 1
woodman 1
at 1
last 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
sell 1
Tom 1
to 1
the 1
strangers 1
for 1
a 1
large 1
piece 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
they 1
paid 1
the 1
price 1
Where 1
would 1
you 1
like 1
to 1
sit 1
said 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
Oh 1
put 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
rim 1
of 1
your 1
hat 1
that 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
nice 1
gallery 1
for 1
me 1
I 1
can 1
walk 1
about 1
there 1
and 1
see 1
the 1
country 1
as 1
we 1
go 1
along 1
So 1
they 1
did 1
as 1
he 1
wished 1
and 1
when 1
Tom 1
had 1
taken 1
leave 1
of 1
his 1
father 1
they 1
took 1
him 1
away 1
with 1
them 1
They 1
journeyed 1
on 1
till 1
it 1
began 1
to 1
be 1
dusky 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
said 1
Let 1
me 1
get 1
down 1
I 1
m 1
tired 1
So 1
the 1
man 1
took 1
off 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
put 1
him 1
down 1
on 1
a 1
clod 1
of 1
earth 1
in 1
a 1
ploughed 1
field 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
road 1
But 1
Tom 1
ran 1
about 1
amongst 1
the 1
furrows 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
slipped 1
into 1
an 1
old 1
mouse 1
hole 1
Good 1
night 1
my 1
masters 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
m 1
off 1
mind 1
and 1
look 1
sharp 1
after 1
me 1
the 1
next 1
time 1
Then 1
they 1
ran 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
and 1
poked 1
the 1
ends 1
of 1
their 1
sticks 1
into 1
the 1
mouse 1
hole 1
but 1
all 1
in 1
vain 1
Tom 1
only 1
crawled 1
farther 1
and 1
farther 1
in 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
it 1
became 1
quite 1
dark 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
forced 1
to 1
go 1
their 1
way 1
without 1
their 1
prize 1
as 1
sulky 1
as 1
could 1
be 1
When 1
Tom 1
found 1
they 1
were 1
gone 1
he 1
came 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
hiding 1
place 1
What 1
dangerous 1
walking 1
it 1
is 1
said 1
he 1
in 1
this 1
ploughed 1
field 1
If 1
I 1
were 1
to 1
fall 1
from 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
great 1
clods 1
I 1
should 1
undoubtedly 1
break 1
my 1
neck 1
At 1
last 1
by 1
good 1
luck 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
large 1
empty 1
snail 1
shell 1
This 1
is 1
lucky 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
can 1
sleep 1
here 1
very 1
well 1
and 1
in 1
he 1
crept 1
Just 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
falling 1
asleep 1
he 1
heard 1
two 1
men 1
passing 1
by 1
chatting 1
together 1
and 1
one 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
How 1
can 1
we 1
rob 1
that 1
rich 1
parson 1
s 1
house 1
of 1
his 1
silver 1
and 1
gold 1
I 1
ll 1
tell 1
you 1
cried 1
Tom 1
What 1
noise 1
was 1
that 1
said 1
the 1
thief 1
frightened 1
I 1
m 1
sure 1
I 1
heard 1
someone 1
speak 1
They 1
stood 1
still 1
listening 1
and 1
Tom 1
said 1
Take 1
me 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
I 1
ll 1
soon 1
show 1
you 1
how 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
parson 1
s 1
money 1
But 1
where 1
are 1
you 1
said 1
they 1
Look 1
about 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
answered 1
he 1
and 1
listen 1
where 1
the 1
sound 1
comes 1
from 1
At 1
last 1
the 1
thieves 1
found 1
him 1
out 1
and 1
lifted 1
him 1
up 1
in 1
their 1
hands 1
You 1
little 1
urchin 1
they 1
said 1
what 1
can 1
you 1
do 1
for 1
us 1
Why 1
I 1
can 1
get 1
between 1
the 1
iron 1
window 1
bars 1
of 1
the 1
parson 1
s 1
house 1
and 1
throw 1
you 1
out 1
whatever 1
you 1
want 1
That 1
s 1
a 1
good 1
thought 1
said 1
the 1
thieves 1
come 1
along 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
what 1
you 1
can 1
do 1
When 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
parson 1
s 1
house 1
Tom 1
slipped 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
bars 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
then 1
called 1
out 1
as 1
loud 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
bawl 1
Will 1
you 1
have 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
here 1
At 1
this 1
the 1
thieves 1
were 1
frightened 1
and 1
said 1
Softly 1
softly 1
Speak 1
low 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
not 1
awaken 1
anybody 1
But 1
Tom 1
seemed 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
understand 1
them 1
and 1
bawled 1
out 1
again 1
How 1
much 1
will 1
you 1
have 1
Shall 1
I 1
throw 1
it 1
all 1
out 1
Now 1
the 1
cook 1
lay 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
and 1
hearing 1
a 1
noise 1
she 1
raised 1
herself 1
up 1
in 1
her 1
bed 1
and 1
listened 1
Meantime 1
the 1
thieves 1
were 1
frightened 1
and 1
ran 1
off 1
a 1
little 1
way 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
plucked 1
up 1
their 1
hearts 1
and 1
said 1
The 1
little 1
urchin 1
is 1
only 1
trying 1
to 1
make 1
fools 1
of 1
us 1
So 1
they 1
came 1
back 1
and 1
whispered 1
softly 1
to 1
him 1
saying 1
Now 1
let 1
us 1
have 1
no 1
more 1
of 1
your 1
roguish 1
jokes 1
but 1
throw 1
us 1
out 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
money 1
Then 1
Tom 1
called 1
out 1
as 1
loud 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
Very 1
well 1
hold 1
your 1
hands 1
here 1
it 1
comes 1
The 1
cook 1
heard 1
this 1
quite 1
plain 1
so 1
she 1
sprang 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
and 1
ran 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
The 1
thieves 1
ran 1
off 1
as 1
if 1
a 1
wolf 1
was 1
at 1
their 1
tails 1
and 1
the 1
maid 1
having 1
groped 1
about 1
and 1
found 1
nothing 1
went 1
away 1
for 1
a 1
light 1
By 1
the 1
time 1
she 1
came 1
back 1
Tom 1
had 1
slipped 1
off 1
into 1
the 1
barn 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
looked 1
about 1
and 1
searched 1
every 1
hole 1
and 1
corner 1
and 1
found 1
nobody 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
thinking 1
she 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
dreaming 1
with 1
her 1
eyes 1
open 1
The 1
little 1
man 1
crawled 1
about 1
in 1
the 1
hay 1
loft 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
found 1
a 1
snug 1
place 1
to 1
finish 1
his 1
night 1
s 1
rest 1
in 1
so 1
he 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
meaning 1
to 1
sleep 1
till 1
daylight 1
and 1
then 1
find 1
his 1
way 1
home 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
But 1
alas 1
how 1
woefully 1
he 1
was 1
undone 1
what 1
crosses 1
and 1
sorrows 1
happen 1
to 1
us 1
all 1
in 1
this 1
world 1
The 1
cook 1
got 1
up 1
early 1
before 1
daybreak 1
to 1
feed 1
the 1
cows 1
and 1
going 1
straight 1
to 1
the 1
hay 1
loft 1
carried 1
away 1
a 1
large 1
bundle 1
of 1
hay 1
with 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
it 1
fast 1
asleep 1
He 1
still 1
however 1
slept 1
on 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
awake 1
till 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
in 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
the 1
cow 1
for 1
the 1
cook 1
had 1
put 1
the 1
hay 1
into 1
the 1
cow 1
s 1
rick 1
and 1
the 1
cow 1
had 1
taken 1
Tom 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
mouthful 1
of 1
it 1
Good 1
lack 1
a 1
day 1
said 1
he 1
how 1
came 1
I 1
to 1
tumble 1
into 1
the 1
mill 1
But 1
he 1
soon 1
found 1
out 1
where 1
he 1
really 1
was 1
and 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
have 1
all 1
his 1
wits 1
about 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
not 1
get 1
between 1
the 1
cow 1
s 1
teeth 1
and 1
so 1
be 1
crushed 1
to 1
death 1
At 1
last 1
down 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
her 1
stomach 1
It 1
is 1
rather 1
dark 1
said 1
he 1
they 1
forgot 1
to 1
build 1
windows 1
in 1
this 1
room 1
to 1
let 1
the 1
sun 1
in 1
a 1
candle 1
would 1
be 1
no 1
bad 1
thing 1
Though 1
he 1
made 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
his 1
bad 1
luck 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
his 1
quarters 1
at 1
all 1
and 1
the 1
worst 1
of 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
hay 1
was 1
always 1
coming 1
down 1
and 1
the 1
space 1
left 1
for 1
him 1
became 1
smaller 1
and 1
smaller 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
cried 1
out 1
as 1
loud 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
Don 1
t 1
bring 1
me 1
any 1
more 1
hay 1
Don 1
t 1
bring 1
me 1
any 1
more 1
hay 1
The 1
maid 1
happened 1
to 1
be 1
just 1
then 1
milking 1
the 1
cow 1
and 1
hearing 1
someone 1
speak 1
but 1
seeing 1
nobody 1
and 1
yet 1
being 1
quite 1
sure 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
voice 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
heard 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
frightened 1
that 1
she 1
fell 1
off 1
her 1
stool 1
and 1
overset 1
the 1
milk 1
pail 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
she 1
could 1
pick 1
herself 1
up 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
dirt 1
she 1
ran 1
off 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
she 1
could 1
to 1
her 1
master 1
the 1
parson 1
and 1
said 1
Sir 1
sir 1
the 1
cow 1
is 1
talking 1
But 1
the 1
parson 1
said 1
Woman 1
thou 1
art 1
surely 1
mad 1
However 1
he 1
went 1
with 1
her 1
into 1
the 1
cow 1
house 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
see 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
matter 1
Scarcely 1
had 1
they 1
set 1
foot 1
on 1
the 1
threshold 1
when 1
Tom 1
called 1
out 1
Don 1
t 1
bring 1
me 1
any 1
more 1
hay 1
Then 1
the 1
parson 1
himself 1
was 1
frightened 1
and 1
thinking 1
the 1
cow 1
was 1
surely 1
bewitched 1
told 1
his 1
man 1
to 1
kill 1
her 1
on 1
the 1
spot 1
So 1
the 1
cow 1
was 1
killed 1
and 1
cut 1
up 1
and 1
the 1
stomach 1
in 1
which 1
Tom 1
lay 1
was 1
thrown 1
out 1
upon 1
a 1
dunghill 1
Tom 1
soon 1
set 1
himself 1
to 1
work 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
which 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
very 1
easy 1
task 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
made 1
room 1
to 1
get 1
his 1
head 1
out 1
fresh 1
ill 1
luck 1
befell 1
him 1
A 1
hungry 1
wolf 1
sprang 1
out 1
and 1
swallowed 1
up 1
the 1
whole 1
stomach 1
with 1
Tom 1
in 1
it 1
at 1
one 1
gulp 1
and 1
ran 1
away 1
Tom 1
however 1
was 1
still 1
not 1
disheartened 1
and 1
thinking 1
the 1
wolf 1
would 1
not 1
dislike 1
having 1
some 1
chat 1
with 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
along 1
he 1
called 1
out 1
My 1
good 1
friend 1
I 1
can 1
show 1
you 1
a 1
famous 1
treat 1
Where 1
s 1
that 1
said 1
the 1
wolf 1
In 1
such 1
and 1
such 1
a 1
house 1
said 1
Tom 1
describing 1
his 1
own 1
father 1
s 1
house 1
You 1
can 1
crawl 1
through 1
the 1
drain 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
then 1
into 1
the 1
pantry 1
and 1
there 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
cakes 1
ham 1
beef 1
cold 1
chicken 1
roast 1
pig 1
apple 1
dumplings 1
and 1
everything 1
that 1
your 1
heart 1
can 1
wish 1
The 1
wolf 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
asked 1
twice 1
so 1
that 1
very 1
night 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
crawled 1
through 1
the 1
drain 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
then 1
into 1
the 1
pantry 1
and 1
ate 1
and 1
drank 1
there 1
to 1
his 1
heart 1
s 1
content 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
had 2
enough 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
eaten 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
go 1
out 1
by 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
he 1
came 1
in 1
This 1
was 1
just 1
what 1
Tom 1
had 1
reckoned 1
upon 1
and 1
now 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
set 1
up 1
a 1
great 1
shout 1
making 1
all 1
the 1
noise 1
he 1
could 1
Will 1
you 1
be 1
easy 1
said 1
the 1
wolf 1
you 1
ll 1
awaken 1
everybody 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
if 1
you 1
make 1
such 1
a 1
clatter 1
What 1
s 1
that 1
to 1
me 1
said 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
you 1
have 1
had 1
your 1
frolic 1
now 1
I 1
ve 1
a 1
mind 1
to 1
be 1
merry 1
myself 1
and 1
he 1
began 1
singing 1
and 1
shouting 1
as 1
loud 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
The 1
woodman 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
being 1
awakened 1
by 1
the 1
noise 1
peeped 1
through 1
a 1
crack 1
in 1
the 1
door 1
but 1
when 1
they 1
saw 1
a 1
wolf 1
was 1
there 1
you 1
may 1
well 1
suppose 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
sadly 1
frightened 1
and 1
the 1
woodman 1
ran 1
for 1
his 1
axe 1
and 1
gave 1
his 1
wife 1
a 1
scythe 1
Do 1
you 1
stay 1
behind 1
said 1
the 1
woodman 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
have 1
knocked 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
head 1
you 1
must 1
rip 1
him 1
up 1
with 1
the 1
scythe 1
Tom 1
heard 1
all 1
this 1
and 1
cried 1
out 1
Father 1
father 1
I 1
am 1
here 1
the 1
wolf 1
has 1
swallowed 1
me 1
And 1
his 1
father 1
said 1
Heaven 1
be 1
praised 1
we 1
have 1
found 1
our 1
dear 1
child 1
again 1
and 1
he 1
told 1
his 1
wife 1
not 1
to 1
use 1
the 1
scythe 1
for 1
fear 1
she 1
should 1
hurt 1
him 1
Then 1
he 1
aimed 1
a 1
great 1
blow 1
and 1
struck 1
the 1
wolf 1
on 1
the 1
head 1
and 1
killed 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
spot 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
dead 1
they 1
cut 1
open 1
his 1
body 1
and 1
set 1
Tommy 1
free 1
Ah 1
said 1
the 1
father 1
what 1
fears 1
we 1
have 1
had 1
for 1
you 1
Yes 1
father 1
answered 1
he 1
I 1
have 1
travelled 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
world 1
I 1
think 1
in 1
one 1
way 1
or 1
other 1
since 1
we 1
parted 1
and 1
now 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
glad 1
to 1
come 1
home 1
and 1
get 1
fresh 1
air 1
again 1
Why 1
where 1
have 1
you 1
been 1
said 1
his 1
father 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
in 1
a 1
mouse 1
hole 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
snail 1
shell 1
and 1
down 1
a 1
cow 1
s 1
throat 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
wolf 1
s 1
belly 1
and 1
yet 1
here 1
I 1
am 1
again 1
safe 1
and 1
sound 1
Well 1
said 1
they 1
you 1
are 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
we 1
will 1
not 1
sell 1
you 1
again 1
for 1
all 1
the 1
riches 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
Then 1
they 1
hugged 1
and 1
kissed 1
their 1
dear 1
little 1
son 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
plenty 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
drink 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
hungry 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
fetched 1
new 1
clothes 1
for 1
him 1
for 1
his 1
old 1
ones 1
had 1
been 1
quite 1
spoiled 1
on 1
his 1
journey 1
So 1
Master 1
Thumb 1
stayed 1
at 1
home 1
with 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
in 1
peace 1
for 1
though 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
so 1
great 1
a 1
traveller 1
and 1
had 1
done 1
and 1
seen 1
so 1
many 1
fine 1
things 1
and 1
was 1
fond 1
enough 1
of 1
telling 1
the 1
whole 1
story 1
he 1
always 1
agreed 1
that 1
after 1
all 1
there 1
s 1
no 1
place 1
like 1
HOME 1
RUMPELSTILTSKIN 1
By 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
a 1
wood 1
in 1
a 1
country 1
a 1
long 1
way 1
off 1
ran 1
a 1
fine 1
stream 1
of 1
water 1
and 1
upon 1
the 1
stream 1
there 1
stood 1
a 1
mill 1
The 1
miller 1
s 1
house 1
was 1
close 1
by 1
and 1
the 1
miller 1
you 1
must 1
know 1
had 1
a 1
very 1
beautiful 1
daughter 1
She 1
was 1
moreover 1
very 1
shrewd 1
and 1
clever 1
and 1
the 1
miller 1
was 1
so 1
proud 1
of 1
her 1
that 1
he 1
one 1
day 1
told 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
the 1
land 1
who 1
used 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
hunt 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
that 1
his 1
daughter 1
could 1
spin 1
gold 1
out 1
of 1
straw 1
Now 1
this 1
king 1
was 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
money 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
miller 1
s 1
boast 1
his 1
greediness 1
was 1
raised 1
and 1
he 1
sent 1
for 1
the 1
girl 1
to 1
be 1
brought 1
before 1
him 1
Then 1
he 1
led 1
her 1
to 1
a 1
chamber 1
in 1
his 1
palace 1
where 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
heap 1
of 1
straw 1
and 1
gave 1
her 1
a 1
spinning 1
wheel 1
and 1
said 1
All 1
this 1
must 1
be 1
spun 1
into 1
gold 1
before 1
morning 1
as 1
you 1
love 1
your 1
life 1
It 1
was 1
in 1
vain 1
that 1
the 1
poor 1
maiden 1
said 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
silly 1
boast 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
for 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
do 1
no 1
such 1
thing 1
as 1
spin 1
straw 1
into 1
gold 1
the 1
chamber 1
door 1
was 1
locked 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
left 1
alone 1
She 1
sat 1
down 1
in 1
one 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
bewail 1
her 1
hard 1
fate 1
when 1
on 1
a 1
sudden 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
a 1
droll 1
looking 1
little 1
man 1
hobbled 1
in 1
and 1
said 1
Good 1
morrow 1
to 1
you 1
my 1
good 1
lass 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
weeping 1
for 1
Alas 1
said 1
she 1
I 1
must 1
spin 1
this 1
straw 1
into 1
gold 1
and 1
I 1
know 1
not 1
how 1
What 1
will 1
you 1
give 1
me 1
said 1
the 1
hobgoblin 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
for 1
you 1
My 1
necklace 1
replied 1
the 1
maiden 1
He 1
took 1
her 1
at 1
her 1
word 1
and 1
sat 1
himself 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
wheel 1
and 1
whistled 1
and 1
sang 1
Round 1
about 1
round 1
about 1
Lo 1
and 1
behold 1
Reel 1
away 1
reel 1
away 1
Straw 1
into 1
gold 1
And 1
round 1
about 1
the 1
wheel 1
went 1
merrily 1
the 1
work 1
was 1
quickly 1
done 1
and 1
the 1
straw 1
was 1
all 1
spun 1
into 1
gold 1
When 1
the 1
king 1
came 1
and 1
saw 1
this 1
he 1
was 1
greatly 1
astonished 1
and 1
pleased 1
but 1
his 1
heart 1
grew 1
still 1
more 1
greedy 1
of 1
gain 1
and 1
he 1
shut 1
up 1
the 1
poor 1
miller 1
s 1
daughter 1
again 1
with 1
a 1
fresh 1
task 1
Then 1
she 1
knew 1
not 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
once 1
more 1
to 1
weep 1
but 1
the 1
dwarf 1
soon 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
said 1
What 1
will 1
you 1
give 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
your 1
task 1
The 1
ring 1
on 1
my 1
finger 1
said 1
she 1
So 1
her 1
little 1
friend 1
took 1
the 1
ring 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
work 1
at 1
the 1
wheel 1
again 1
and 1
whistled 1
and 1
sang 1
Round 1
about 1
round 1
about 1
Lo 1
and 1
behold 1
Reel 1
away 1
reel 1
away 1
Straw 1
into 1
gold 1
till 1
long 1
before 1
morning 1
all 1
was 1
done 1
again 1
The 1
king 1
was 1
greatly 1
delighted 1
to 1
see 1
all 1
this 1
glittering 1
treasure 1
but 1
still 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
enough 1
so 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
miller 1
s 1
daughter 1
to 1
a 1
yet 1
larger 1
heap 1
and 1
said 1
All 1
this 1
must 1
be 1
spun 1
tonight 1
and 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
you 1
shall 1
be 1
my 1
queen 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
alone 1
that 1
dwarf 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
said 1
What 1
will 1
you 1
give 1
me 1
to 1
spin 1
gold 1
for 1
you 1
this 1
third 1
time 1
I 1
have 1
nothing 1
left 1
said 1
she 1
Then 1
say 1
you 1
will 1
give 1
me 1
said 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
the 1
first 1
little 1
child 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
queen 1
That 1
may 1
never 1
be 1
thought 1
the 1
miller 1
s 1
daughter 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
knew 1
no 1
other 1
way 1
to 1
get 1
her 1
task 1
done 1
she 1
said 1
she 1
would 1
do 1
what 1
he 1
asked 1
Round 1
went 1
the 1
wheel 1
again 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
song 1
and 1
the 1
manikin 1
once 1
more 1
spun 1
the 1
heap 1
into 1
gold 1
The 1
king 1
came 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
finding 1
all 1
he 1
wanted 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
keep 1
his 1
word 1
so 1
he 1
married 1
the 1
miller 1
s 1
daughter 1
and 1
she 1
really 1
became 1
queen 1
At 1
the 1
birth 1
of 1
her 1
first 1
little 1
child 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
glad 1
and 1
forgot 1
the 1
dwarf 1
and 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
said 1
But 1
one 1
day 1
he 1
came 1
into 1
her 1
room 1
where 1
she 1
was 1
sitting 1
playing 1
with 1
her 1
baby 1
and 1
put 1
her 1
in 1
mind 1
of 1
it 1
Then 1
she 1
grieved 1
sorely 1
at 1
her 1
misfortune 1
and 1
said 1
she 1
would 1
give 1
him 1
all 1
the 1
wealth 1
of 1
the 1
kingdom 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
let 1
her 1
off 1
but 1
in 1
vain 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
her 1
tears 1
softened 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
three 1
days 1
grace 1
and 1
if 1
during 1
that 1
time 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
my 1
name 1
you 1
shall 1
keep 1
your 1
child 1
Now 1
the 1
queen 1
lay 1
awake 1
all 1
night 1
thinking 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
odd 1
names 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
ever 1
heard 1
and 1
she 1
sent 1
messengers 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
land 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
new 1
ones 1
The 1
next 1
day 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
came 1
and 1
she 1
began 1
with 1
TIMOTHY 1
ICHABOD 1
BENJAMIN 1
JEREMIAH 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
names 1
she 1
could 1
remember 1
but 1
to 1
all 1
and 1
each 1
of 1
them 1
he 1
said 1
Madam 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
my 1
name 1
The 1
second 1
day 1
she 1
began 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
comical 1
names 1
she 1
could 1
hear 1
of 1
BANDY 1
LEGS 1
HUNCHBACK 1
CROOK 1
SHANKS 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
but 1
the 1
little 1
gentleman 1
still 1
said 1
to 1
every 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
Madam 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
my 1
name 1
The 1
third 1
day 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
messengers 1
came 1
back 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
have 1
travelled 1
two 1
days 1
without 1
hearing 1
of 1
any 1
other 1
names 1
but 1
yesterday 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
climbing 1
a 1
high 1
hill 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
where 1
the 1
fox 1
and 1
the 1
hare 1
bid 1
each 1
other 1
good 1
night 1
I 1
saw 1
a 1
little 1
hut 1
and 1
before 1
the 1
hut 1
burnt 1
a 1
fire 1
and 1
round 1
about 1
the 1
fire 1
a 1
funny 1
little 1
dwarf 1
was 1
dancing 1
upon 1
one 1
leg 1
and 1
singing 1
Merrily 1
the 1
feast 1
I 1
ll 1
make 1
Today 1
I 1
ll 1
brew 1
tomorrow 1
bake 1
Merrily 1
I 1
ll 1
dance 1
and 1
sing 1
For 1
next 1
day 1
will 1
a 1
stranger 1
bring 1
Little 1
does 1
my 1
lady 1
dream 1
Rumpelstiltskin 1
is 1
my 1
name 1
When 1
the 1
queen 1
heard 1
this 1
she 1
jumped 1
for 1
joy 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
her 1
little 1
friend 1
came 1
she 1
sat 1
down 1
upon 1
her 1
throne 1
and 1
called 1
all 1
her 1
court 1
round 1
to 1
enjoy 1
the 1
fun 1
and 1
the 1
nurse 1
stood 1
by 1
her 1
side 1
with 1
the 1
baby 1
in 1
her 1
arms 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
ready 1
to 1
be 1
given 1
up 1
Then 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
began 1
to 1
chuckle 1
at 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
having 1
the 1
poor 1
child 1
to 1
take 1
home 1
with 1
him 1
to 1
his 1
hut 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
he 1
cried 1
out 1
Now 1
lady 1
what 1
is 1
my 1
name 1
Is 1
it 1
JOHN 1
asked 1
she 1
No 1
madam 1
Is 1
it 1
TOM 1
No 1
madam 1
Is 1
it 1
JEMMY 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
Can 1
your 1
name 1
be 1
RUMPELSTILTSKIN 1
said 1
the 1
lady 1
slyly 1
Some 1
witch 1
told 1
you 1
that 1
some 1
witch 1
told 1
you 1
that 1
cried 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
and 1
dashed 1
his 1
right 1
foot 1
in 1
a 1
rage 1
so 1
deep 1
into 1
the 1
floor 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
lay 1
hold 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
both 1
hands 1
to 1
pull 1
it 1
out 1
Then 1
he 1
made 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
his 1
way 1
off 1
while 1
the 1
nurse 1
laughed 1
and 1
the 1
baby 1
crowed 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
court 1
jeered 1
at 1
him 1
for 1
having 1
had 1
so 1
much 1
trouble 1
for 1
nothing 1
and 1
said 1
We 1
wish 1
you 1
a 1
very 1
good 1
morning 1
and 1
a 1
merry 1
feast 1
Mr 1
RUMPLESTILTSKIN 1
CLEVER 1
GRETEL 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
cook 1
named 1
Gretel 1
who 1
wore 1
shoes 1
with 1
red 1
heels 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
walked 1
out 1
with 1
them 1
on 1
she 1
turned 1
herself 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
quite 1
happy 1
and 1
thought 1
You 1
certainly 1
are 1
a 1
pretty 1
girl 1
And 1
when 1
she 1
came 1
home 1
she 1
drank 1
in 1
her 1
gladness 1
of 1
heart 1
a 1
draught 1
of 1
wine 1
and 1
as 1
wine 1
excites 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
eat 1
she 1
tasted 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
whatever 1
she 1
was 1
cooking 1
until 1
she 1
was 1
satisfied 1
and 1
said 1
The 1
cook 1
must 1
know 1
what 1
the 1
food 1
is 1
like 1
It 1
came 1
to 1
pass 1
that 1
the 1
master 1
one 1
day 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
Gretel 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
guest 1
coming 1
this 1
evening 1
prepare 1
me 1
two 1
fowls 1
very 1
daintily 1
I 1
will 1
see 1
to 1
it 1
master 1
answered 1
Gretel 1
She 1
killed 1
two 1
fowls 1
scalded 1
them 1
plucked 1
them 1
put 1
them 1
on 1
the 1
spit 1
and 1
towards 1
evening 1
set 1
them 1
before 1
the 1
fire 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
roast 1
The 1
fowls 1
began 1
to 1
turn 1
brown 1
and 1
were 1
nearly 1
ready 1
but 1
the 1
guest 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
arrived 1
Then 1
Gretel 1
called 1
out 1
to 1
her 1
master 1
If 1
the 1
guest 1
does 1
not 1
come 1
I 1
must 1
take 1
the 1
fowls 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
fire 1
but 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
sin 1
and 1
a 1
shame 1
if 1
they 1
are 1
not 1
eaten 1
the 1
moment 1
they 1
are 1
at 1
their 1
juiciest 1
The 1
master 1
said 1
I 1
will 1
run 1
myself 1
and 1
fetch 1
the 1
guest 1
When 1
the 1
master 1
had 1
turned 1
his 1
back 1
Gretel 1
laid 1
the 1
spit 1
with 1
the 1
fowls 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
thought 1
Standing 1
so 1
long 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
there 1
makes 1
one 1
sweat 1
and 1
thirsty 1
who 1
knows 1
when 1
they 1
will 1
come 1
Meanwhile 1
I 1
will 1
run 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
and 1
take 1
a 1
drink 1
She 1
ran 1
down 1
set 1
a 1
jug 1
said 1
God 1
bless 1
it 1
for 1
you 1
Gretel 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
good 1
drink 1
and 1
thought 1
that 1
wine 1
should 1
flow 1
on 1
and 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
interrupted 1
and 1
took 1
yet 1
another 1
hearty 1
draught 1
Then 1
she 1
went 1
and 1
put 1
the 1
fowls 1
down 1
again 1
to 1
the 1
fire 1
basted 1
them 1
and 1
drove 1
the 1
spit 1
merrily 1
round 1
But 1
as 1
the 1
roast 1
meat 1
smelt 1
so 1
good 1
Gretel 1
thought 1
Something 1
might 1
be 1
wrong 1
it 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
tasted 1
She 1
touched 1
it 1
with 1
her 1
finger 1
and 1
said 1
Ah 1
how 1
good 1
fowls 1
are 1
It 1
certainly 1
is 1
a 1
sin 1
and 1
a 1
shame 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
not 1
eaten 1
at 1
the 1
right 1
time 1
She 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
the 1
master 1
was 1
not 1
coming 1
with 1
his 1
guest 1
but 1
she 1
saw 1
no 1
one 1
and 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
fowls 1
and 1
thought 1
One 1
of 1
the 1
wings 1
is 1
burning 1
I 1
had 1
better 1
take 1
it 1
off 1
and 1
eat 1
it 1
So 1
she 1
cut 1
it 1
off 1
ate 1
it 1
and 1
enjoyed 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
she 1
thought 1
The 1
other 1
must 1
go 1
down 1
too 1
or 1
else 1
master 1
will 1
observe 1
that 1
something 1
is 1
missing 1
When 1
the 1
two 1
wings 1
were 1
eaten 1
she 1
went 1
and 1
looked 1
for 1
her 1
master 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
see 1
him 1
It 1
suddenly 1
occurred 1
to 1
her 1
Who 1
knows 1
They 1
are 1
perhaps 1
not 1
coming 1
at 1
all 1
and 1
have 1
turned 1
in 1
somewhere 1
Then 1
she 1
said 1
Well 1
Gretel 1
enjoy 1
yourself 1
one 1
fowl 1
has 1
been 1
cut 1
into 1
take 1
another 1
drink 1
and 1
eat 1
it 1
up 1
entirely 1
when 1
it 1
is 1
eaten 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
some 1
peace 1
why 1
should 1
God 1
s 1
good 1
gifts 1
be 1
spoilt 1
So 1
she 1
ran 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
again 1
took 1
an 1
enormous 1
drink 1
and 1
ate 1
up 1
the 1
one 1
chicken 1
in 1
great 1
glee 1
When 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
chickens 1
was 1
swallowed 1
down 1
and 1
still 1
her 1
master 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
Gretel 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
and 1
said 1
What 1
one 1
is 1
the 1
other 1
should 1
be 1
likewise 1
the 1
two 1
go 1
together 1
what 1
s 1
right 1
for 1
the 1
one 1
is 1
right 1
for 1
the 1
other 1
I 1
think 1
if 1
I 1
were 1
to 1
take 1
another 1
draught 1
it 1
would 1
do 1
me 1
no 1
harm 1
So 1
she 1
took 1
another 1
hearty 1
drink 1
and 1
let 1
the 1
second 1
chicken 1
follow 1
the 1
first 1
While 1
she 1
was 1
making 1
the 1
most 1
of 1
it 1
her 1
master 1
came 1
and 1
cried 1
Hurry 1
up 1
Gretel 1
the 1
guest 1
is 1
coming 1
directly 1
after 1
me 1
Yes 1
sir 1
I 1
will 1
soon 1
serve 1
up 1
answered 1
Gretel 1
Meantime 1
the 1
master 1
looked 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
table 1
was 1
properly 1
laid 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
great 1
knife 1
wherewith 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
carve 1
the 1
chickens 1
and 1
sharpened 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
steps 1
Presently 1
the 1
guest 1
came 1
and 1
knocked 1
politely 1
and 1
courteously 1
at 1
the 1
house 1
door 1
Gretel 1
ran 1
and 1
looked 1
to 1
see 1
who 1
was 1
there 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
guest 1
she 1
put 1
her 1
finger 1
to 1
her 1
lips 1
and 1
said 1
Hush 1
hush 1
go 1
away 1
as 1
quickly 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
if 1
my 1
master 1
catches 1
you 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
worse 1
for 1
you 1
he 1
certainly 1
did 1
ask 1
you 1
to 1
supper 1
but 1
his 1
intention 1
is 1
to 1
cut 1
off 1
your 1
two 1
ears 1
Just 1
listen 1
how 1
he 1
is 1
sharpening 1
the 1
knife 1
for 1
it 1
The 1
guest 1
heard 1
the 1
sharpening 1
and 1
hurried 1
down 1
the 1
steps 1
again 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
Gretel 1
was 1
not 1
idle 1
she 1
ran 1
screaming 1
to 1
her 1
master 1
and 1
cried 1
You 1
have 1
invited 1
a 1
fine 1
guest 1
Why 1
Gretel 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
by 1
that 1
Yes 1
said 1
she 1
he 1
has 1
taken 1
the 1
chickens 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
just 1
going 1
to 1
serve 1
up 1
off 1
the 1
dish 1
and 1
has 1
run 1
away 1
with 1
them 1
That 1
s 1
a 1
nice 1
trick 1
said 1
her 1
master 1
and 1
lamented 1
the 1
fine 1
chickens 1
If 1
he 1
had 1
but 1
left 1
me 1
one 1
so 1
that 1
something 1
remained 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
eat 1
He 1
called 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
stop 1
but 1
the 1
guest 1
pretended 1
not 1
to 1
hear 1
Then 1
he 1
ran 1
after 1
him 1
with 1
the 1
knife 1
still 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
crying 1
Just 1
one 1
just 1
one 1
meaning 1
that 1
the 1
guest 1
should 1
leave 1
him 1
just 1
one 1
chicken 1
and 1
not 1
take 1
both 1
The 1
guest 1
however 1
thought 1
no 1
otherwise 1
than 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
give 1
up 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
ears 1
and 1
ran 1
as 1
if 1
fire 1
were 1
burning 1
under 1
him 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
take 1
them 1
both 1
with 1
him 1
THE 1
OLD 1
MAN 1
AND 1
HIS 1
GRANDSON 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
very 1
old 1
man 1
whose 1
eyes 1
had 1
become 1
dim 1
his 1
ears 1
dull 1
of 1
hearing 1
his 1
knees 1
trembled 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
sat 1
at 1
table 1
he 1
could 1
hardly 1
hold 1
the 1
spoon 1
and 1
spilt 1
the 1
broth 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
cloth 1
or 1
let 1
it 1
run 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
mouth 1
His 1
son 1
and 1
his 1
son 1
s 1
wife 1
were 1
disgusted 1
at 1
this 1
so 1
the 1
old 1
grandfather 1
at 1
last 1
had 1
to 1
sit 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
behind 1
the 1
stove 1
and 1
they 1
gave 1
him 1
his 1
food 1
in 1
an 1
earthenware 1
bowl 1
and 1
not 1
even 1
enough 1
of 1
it 1
And 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
look 1
towards 1
the 1
table 1
with 1
his 1
eyes 1
full 1
of 1
tears 1
Once 1
too 1
his 1
trembling 1
hands 1
could 1
not 1
hold 1
the 1
bowl 1
and 1
it 1
fell 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
broke 1
The 1
young 1
wife 1
scolded 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
said 1
nothing 1
and 1
only 1
sighed 1
Then 1
they 1
brought 1
him 1
a 1
wooden 1
bowl 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
half 1
pence 1
out 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
eat 1
They 1
were 1
once 1
sitting 1
thus 1
when 1
the 1
little 1
grandson 1
of 1
four 1
years 1
old 1
began 1
to 1
gather 1
together 1
some 1
bits 1
of 1
wood 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
What 1
are 1
you 1
doing 1
there 1
asked 1
the 1
father 1
I 1
am 1
making 1
a 1
little 1
trough 1
answered 1
the 1
child 1
for 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
to 1
eat 1
out 1
of 1
when 1
I 1
am 1
big 1
The 1
man 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
looked 1
at 1
each 1
other 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
presently 1
began 1
to 1
cry 1
Then 1
they 1
took 1
the 1
old 1
grandfather 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
henceforth 1
always 1
let 1
him 1
eat 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
likewise 1
said 1
nothing 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
spill 1
a 1
little 1
of 1
anything 1
THE 1
LITTLE 1
PEASANT 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
certain 1
village 1
wherein 1
no 1
one 1
lived 1
but 1
really 1
rich 1
peasants 1
and 1
just 1
one 1
poor 1
one 1
whom 1
they 1
called 1
the 1
little 1
peasant 1
He 1
had 1
not 1
even 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
a 1
cow 1
and 1
still 1
less 1
money 1
to 1
buy 1
one 1
and 1
yet 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
did 1
so 1
wish 1
to 1
have 1
one 1
One 1
day 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
Listen 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
good 1
idea 1
there 1
is 1
our 1
gossip 1
the 1
carpenter 1
he 1
shall 1
make 1
us 1
a 1
wooden 1
calf 1
and 1
paint 1
it 1
brown 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
looks 1
like 1
any 1
other 1
and 1
in 1
time 1
it 1
will 1
certainly 1
get 1
big 1
and 1
be 1
a 1
cow 1
the 1
woman 1
also 1
liked 1
the 1
idea 1
and 1
their 1
gossip 1
the 1
carpenter 1
cut 1
and 1
planed 1
the 1
calf 1
and 1
painted 1
it 1
as 1
it 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
and 1
made 1
it 1
with 1
its 1
head 1
hanging 1
down 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
eating 1
Next 1
morning 1
when 1
the 1
cows 1
were 1
being 1
driven 1
out 1
the 1
little 1
peasant 1
called 1
the 1
cow 1
herd 1
in 1
and 1
said 1
Look 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
little 1
calf 1
there 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
still 1
small 1
and 1
has 1
to 1
be 1
carried 1
The 1
cow 1
herd 1
said 1
All 1
right 1
and 1
took 1
it 1
in 1
his 1
arms 1
and 1
carried 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
pasture 1
and 1
set 1
it 1
among 1
the 1
grass 1
The 1
little 1
calf 1
always 1
remained 1
standing 1
like 1
one 1
which 1
was 1
eating 1
and 1
the 1
cow 1
herd 1
said 1
It 1
will 1
soon 1
run 1
by 1
itself 1
just 1
look 1
how 1
it 1
eats 1
already 1
At 1
night 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
drive 1
the 1
herd 1
home 1
again 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
calf 1
If 1
you 1
can 1
stand 1
there 1
and 1
eat 1
your 1
fill 1
you 1
can 1
also 1
go 1
on 1
your 1
four 1
legs 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
to 1
drag 1
you 1
home 1
again 1
in 1
my 1
arms 1
But 1
the 1
little 1
peasant 1
stood 1
at 1
his 1
door 1
and 1
waited 1
for 1
his 1
little 1
calf 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
cow 1
herd 1
drove 1
the 1
cows 1
through 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
the 1
calf 1
was 1
missing 1
he 1
inquired 1
where 1
it 1
was 1
The 1
cow 1
herd 1
answered 1
It 1
is 1
still 1
standing 1
out 1
there 1
eating 1
It 1
would 1
not 1
stop 1
and 1
come 1
with 1
us 1
But 1
the 1
little 1
peasant 1
said 1
Oh 1
but 1
I 1
must 1
have 1
my 1
beast 1
back 1
again 1
Then 1
they 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
meadow 1
together 1
but 1
someone 1
had 1
stolen 1
the 1
calf 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
gone 1
The 1
cow 1
herd 1
said 1
It 1
must 1
have 1
run 1
away 1
The 1
peasant 1
however 1
said 1
Don 1
t 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
and 1
led 1
the 1
cow 1
herd 1
before 1
the 1
mayor 1
who 1
for 1
his 1
carelessness 1
condemned 1
him 1
to 1
give 1
the 1
peasant 1
a 1
cow 1
for 1
the 1
calf 1
which 1
had 1
run 1
away 1
And 1
now 1
the 1
little 1
peasant 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
had 1
the 1
cow 1
for 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
so 1
long 1
wished 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
heartily 1
glad 1
but 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
food 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
could 1
give 1
it 1
nothing 1
to 1
eat 1
so 1
it 1
soon 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
killed 1
They 1
salted 1
the 1
flesh 1
and 1
the 1
peasant 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
sell 1
the 1
skin 1
there 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
buy 1
a 1
new 1
calf 1
with 1
the 1
proceeds 1
On 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
passed 1
by 1
a 1
mill 1
and 1
there 1
sat 1
a 1
raven 1
with 1
broken 1
wings 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
pity 1
he 1
took 1
him 1
and 1
wrapped 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
skin 1
But 1
as 1
the 1
weather 1
grew 1
so 1
bad 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
storm 1
of 1
rain 1
and 1
wind 1
he 1
could 1
go 1
no 1
farther 1
and 1
turned 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
mill 1
and 1
begged 1
for 1
shelter 1
The 1
miller 1
s 1
wife 1
was 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
peasant 1
Lay 1
yourself 1
on 1
the 1
straw 1
there 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
slice 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
cheese 1
The 1
peasant 1
ate 1
it 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
with 1
his 1
skin 1
beside 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
woman 1
thought 1
He 1
is 1
tired 1
and 1
has 1
gone 1
to 1
sleep 1
In 1
the 1
meantime 1
came 1
the 1
parson 1
the 1
miller 1
s 1
wife 1
received 1
him 1
well 1
and 1
said 1
My 1
husband 1
is 1
out 1
so 1
we 1
will 1
have 1
a 1
feast 1
The 1
peasant 1
listened 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
them 1
talk 1
about 1
feasting 1
he 1
was 1
vexed 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
forced 1
to 1
make 1
shift 1
with 1
a 1
slice 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
cheese 1
Then 1
the 1
woman 1
served 1
up 1
four 1
different 1
things 1
roast 1
meat 1
salad 1
cakes 1
and 1
wine 1
Just 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
about 1
to 1
sit 1
down 1
and 1
eat 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
knocking 1
outside 1
The 1
woman 1
said 1
Oh 1
heavens 1
It 1
is 1
my 1
husband 1
she 1
quickly 1
hid 1
the 1
roast 1
meat 1
inside 1
the 1
tiled 1
stove 1
the 1
wine 1
under 1
the 1
pillow 1
the 1
salad 1
on 1
the 1
bed 1
the 1
cakes 1
under 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
parson 1
in 1
the 1
closet 1
on 1
the 1
porch 1
Then 1
she 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
for 1
her 1
husband 1
and 1
said 1
Thank 1
heaven 1
you 1
are 1
back 1
again 1
There 1
is 1
such 1
a 1
storm 1
it 1
looks 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
world 1
were 1
coming 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
The 1
miller 1
saw 1
the 1
peasant 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
straw 1
and 1
asked 1
What 1
is 1
that 1
fellow 1
doing 1
there 1
Ah 1
said 1
the 1
wife 1
the 1
poor 1
knave 1
came 1
in 1
the 1
storm 1
and 1
rain 1
and 1
begged 1
for 1
shelter 1
so 1
I 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
cheese 1
and 1
showed 1
him 1
where 1
the 1
straw 1
was 1
The 1
man 1
said 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
objection 1
but 1
be 1
quick 1
and 1
get 1
me 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
The 1
woman 1
said 1
But 1
I 1
have 1
nothing 1
but 1
bread 1
and 1
cheese 1
I 1
am 1
contented 1
with 1
anything 1
replied 1
the 1
husband 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
I 1
am 1
concerned 1
bread 1
and 1
cheese 1
will 1
do 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
peasant 1
and 1
said 1
Come 1
and 1
eat 1
some 1
more 1
with 1
me 1
The 1
peasant 1
did 1
not 1
require 1
to 1
be 1
invited 1
twice 1
but 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
ate 1
After 1
this 1
the 1
miller 1
saw 1
the 1
skin 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
raven 1
was 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
asked 1
What 1
have 1
you 1
there 1
The 1
peasant 1
answered 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
soothsayer 1
inside 1
it 1
Can 1
he 1
foretell 1
anything 1
to 1
me 1
said 1
the 1
miller 1
Why 1
not 1
answered 1
the 1
peasant 1
but 1
he 1
only 1
says 1
four 1
things 1
and 1
the 1
fifth 1
he 1
keeps 1
to 1
himself 1
The 1
miller 1
was 1
curious 1
and 1
said 1
Let 1
him 1
foretell 1
something 1
for 1
once 1
Then 1
the 1
peasant 1
pinched 1
the 1
raven 1
s 1
head 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
croaked 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
noise 1
like 1
krr 2
The 1
miller 1
said 1
What 1
did 1
he 1
say 1
The 1
peasant 1
answered 1
In 1
the 1
first 1
place 1
he 1
says 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
some 1
wine 1
hidden 1
under 1
the 1
pillow 1
Bless 1
me 1
cried 1
the 1
miller 1
and 1
went 1
there 1
and 1
found 1
the 1
wine 1
Now 1
go 1
on 1
said 1
he 1
The 1
peasant 1
made 1
the 1
raven 1
croak 1
again 1
and 1
said 1
In 1
the 1
second 1
place 1
he 1
says 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
some 1
roast 1
meat 1
in 1
the 1
tiled 1
stove 1
Upon 1
my 1
word 1
cried 1
the 1
miller 1
and 1
went 1
thither 1
and 1
found 1
the 1
roast 1
meat 1
The 1
peasant 1
made 1
the 1
raven 1
prophesy 1
still 1
more 1
and 1
said 1
Thirdly 1
he 1
says 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
some 1
salad 1
on 1
the 1
bed 1
That 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
fine 1
thing 1
cried 1
the 1
miller 1
and 1
went 1
there 1
and 1
found 1
the 1
salad 1
At 1
last 1
the 1
peasant 1
pinched 1
the 1
raven 1
once 1
more 1
till 1
he 1
croaked 1
and 1
said 1
Fourthly 1
he 1
says 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
some 1
cakes 1
under 1
the 1
bed 1
That 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
fine 1
thing 1
cried 1
the 1
miller 1
and 1
looked 1
there 1
and 1
found 1
the 1
cakes 1
And 1
now 1
the 1
two 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
together 1
but 1
the 1
miller 1
s 1
wife 1
was 1
frightened 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
and 1
took 1
all 1
the 1
keys 1
with 1
her 1
The 1
miller 1
would 1
have 1
liked 1
much 1
to 1
know 1
the 1
fifth 1
but 1
the 1
little 1
peasant 1
said 1
First 1
we 1
will 1
quickly 1
eat 1
the 1
four 1
things 1
for 1
the 1
fifth 1
is 1
something 1
bad 1
So 1
they 1
ate 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
they 1
bargained 1
how 1
much 1
the 1
miller 1
was 1
to 1
give 1
for 1
the 1
fifth 1
prophecy 1
until 1
they 1
agreed 1
on 1
three 1
hundred 1
talers 1
Then 1
the 1
peasant 1
once 1
more 1
pinched 1
the 1
raven 1
s 1
head 1
till 1
he 1
croaked 1
loudly 1
The 1
miller 1
asked 1
What 1
did 1
he 1
say 1
The 1
peasant 1
replied 1
He 1
says 1
that 1
the 1
Devil 1
is 1
hiding 1
outside 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
closet 1
on 1
the 1
porch 1
The 1
miller 1
said 1
The 1
Devil 1
must 1
go 1
out 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
house 1
door 1
then 1
the 1
woman 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
give 1
up 1
the 1
keys 1
and 1
the 1
peasant 1
unlocked 1
the 1
closet 1
The 1
parson 1
ran 1
out 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
and 1
the 1
miller 1
said 1
It 1
was 1
true 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
black 1
rascal 1
with 1
my 1
own 1
eyes 1
The 1
peasant 1
however 1
made 1
off 1
next 1
morning 1
by 1
daybreak 1
with 1
the 1
three 1
hundred 1
talers 1
At 1
home 1
the 1
small 1
peasant 1
gradually 1
launched 1
out 1
he 1
built 1
a 1
beautiful 1
house 1
and 1
the 1
peasants 1
said 1
The 1
small 1
peasant 1
has 1
certainly 1
been 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
golden 1
snow 1
falls 1
and 1
people 1
carry 1
the 1
gold 1
home 1
in 1
shovels 1
Then 1
the 1
small 1
peasant 1
was 1
brought 1
before 1
the 1
mayor 1
and 1
bidden 1
to 1
say 1
from 1
whence 1
his 1
wealth 1
came 1
He 1
answered 1
I 1
sold 1
my 1
cow 1
s 1
skin 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
for 1
three 1
hundred 1
talers 1
When 1
the 1
peasants 1
heard 1
that 1
they 1
too 1
wished 1
to 1
enjoy 1
this 1
great 1
profit 1
and 1
ran 1
home 1
killed 1
all 1
their 1
cows 1
and 1
stripped 1
off 1
their 1
skins 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
sell 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
to 1
the 1
greatest 1
advantage 1
The 1
mayor 1
however 1
said 1
But 1
my 1
servant 1
must 1
go 1
first 1
When 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
merchant 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
give 1
her 1
more 1
than 1
two 1
talers 1
for 1
a 1
skin 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
others 1
came 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
give 1
them 1
so 1
much 1
and 1
said 1
What 1
can 1
I 1
do 1
with 1
all 1
these 1
skins 1
Then 1
the 1
peasants 1
were 1
vexed 1
that 1
the 1
small 1
peasant 1
should 1
have 1
thus 1
outwitted 1
them 1
wanted 1
to 1
take 1
vengeance 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
accused 1
him 1
of 1
this 1
treachery 1
before 1
the 1
mayor 1
The 1
innocent 1
little 1
peasant 1
was 1
unanimously 1
sentenced 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
rolled 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
in 1
a 1
barrel 1
pierced 1
full 1
of 1
holes 1
He 1
was 1
led 1
forth 1
and 1
a 1
priest 1
was 1
brought 1
who 1
was 1
to 1
say 1
a 1
mass 1
for 1
his 1
soul 1
The 1
others 1
were 1
all 1
obliged 1
to 1
retire 1
to 1
a 1
distance 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
peasant 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
priest 1
he 1
recognized 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
with 1
the 1
miller 1
s 1
wife 1
He 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
I 1
set 1
you 1
free 1
from 1
the 1
closet 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
from 1
the 1
barrel 1
At 1
this 1
same 1
moment 1
up 1
came 1
with 1
a 1
flock 1
of 1
sheep 1
the 1
very 1
shepherd 1
whom 1
the 1
peasant 1
knew 1
had 1
long 1
been 1
wishing 1
to 1
be 1
mayor 1
so 1
he 1
cried 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
might 1
No 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
if 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
insists 1
on 1
it 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
The 1
shepherd 1
hearing 1
that 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
asked 1
What 1
are 1
you 1
about 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
do 1
The 1
peasant 1
said 1
They 1
want 1
to 1
make 1
me 1
mayor 1
if 1
I 1
will 1
but 1
put 1
myself 1
in 1
the 1
barrel 1
but 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
The 1
shepherd 1
said 1
If 1
nothing 1
more 1
than 1
that 1
is 1
needful 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
be 1
mayor 1
I 1
would 1
get 1
into 1
the 1
barrel 1
at 1
once 1
The 1
peasant 1
said 1
If 1
you 1
will 1
get 1
in 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
mayor 1
The 1
shepherd 1
was 1
willing 1
and 1
got 1
in 1
and 1
the 1
peasant 1
shut 1
the 1
top 1
down 1
on 1
him 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
shepherd 1
s 1
flock 1
for 1
himself 1
and 1
drove 1
it 1
away 1
The 1
parson 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
crowd 1
and 1
declared 1
that 1
the 1
mass 1
had 1
been 1
said 1
Then 1
they 1
came 1
and 1
rolled 1
the 1
barrel 1
towards 1
the 1
water 1
When 1
the 1
barrel 1
began 1
to 1
roll 1
the 1
shepherd 1
cried 1
I 1
am 1
quite 1
willing 1
to 1
be 1
mayor 1
They 1
believed 1
no 1
otherwise 1
than 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
peasant 1
who 1
was 1
saying 1
this 1
and 1
answered 1
That 1
is 1
what 1
we 1
intend 1
but 1
first 1
you 1
shall 1
look 1
about 1
you 1
a 1
little 1
down 1
below 1
there 1
and 1
they 1
rolled 1
the 1
barrel 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
After 1
that 1
the 1
peasants 1
went 1
home 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
entering 1
the 1
village 1
the 1
small 1
peasant 1
also 1
came 1
quietly 1
in 1
driving 1
a 1
flock 1
of 1
sheep 1
and 1
looking 1
quite 1
contented 1
Then 1
the 1
peasants 1
were 1
astonished 1
and 1
said 1
Peasant 1
from 1
whence 1
do 1
you 1
come 1
Have 1
you 1
come 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
Yes 1
truly 1
replied 1
the 1
peasant 1
I 1
sank 1
deep 2
down 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
I 1
pushed 1
the 1
bottom 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
barrel 1
and 1
crept 1
out 1
and 1
there 1
were 1
pretty 1
meadows 1
on 1
which 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
lambs 1
were 1
feeding 1
and 1
from 1
thence 1
I 1
brought 1
this 1
flock 1
away 1
with 1
me 1
Said 1
the 1
peasants 1
Are 1
there 1
any 1
more 1
there 1
Oh 1
yes 1
said 1
he 1
more 1
than 1
I 1
could 1
want 1
Then 1
the 1
peasants 1
made 1
up 1
their 1
minds 1
that 1
they 1
too 1
would 1
fetch 1
some 1
sheep 1
for 1
themselves 1
a 1
flock 1
apiece 1
but 1
the 1
mayor 1
said 1
I 1
come 1
first 1
So 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
water 1
together 1
and 1
just 1
then 1
there 1
were 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
small 1
fleecy 1
clouds 1
in 1
the 1
blue 1
sky 1
which 1
are 1
called 1
little 1
lambs 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
reflected 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
whereupon 1
the 1
peasants 1
cried 1
We 1
already 1
see 1
the 1
sheep 1
down 1
below 1
The 1
mayor 1
pressed 1
forward 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
will 1
go 1
down 1
first 1
and 1
look 1
about 1
me 1
and 1
if 1
things 1
promise 1
well 1
I 1
ll 1
call 1
you 1
So 1
he 1
jumped 1
in 1
splash 1
went 1
the 1
water 1
it 1
sounded 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
calling 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
crowd 1
plunged 1
in 1
after 1
him 1
as 1
one 1
man 1
Then 1
the 1
entire 1
village 1
was 1
dead 1
and 1
the 1
small 1
peasant 1
as 1
sole 1
heir 1
became 1
a 1
rich 1
man 1
FREDERICK 1
AND 1
CATHERINE 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
man 1
called 1
Frederick 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
wife 1
whose 1
name 1
was 1
Catherine 1
and 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
long 1
been 1
married 1
One 1
day 1
Frederick 1
said 1
Kate 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
work 1
in 1
the 1
fields 1
when 1
I 1
come 1
back 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
hungry 1
so 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
something 1
nice 1
cooked 1
and 1
a 1
good 1
draught 1
of 1
ale 1
Very 1
well 1
said 1
she 1
it 1
shall 1
all 1
be 1
ready 1
When 1
dinner 1
time 1
drew 1
nigh 1
Catherine 1
took 1
a 1
nice 1
steak 1
which 1
was 1
all 1
the 1
meat 1
she 1
had 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
fire 1
to 1
fry 1
The 1
steak 1
soon 1
began 1
to 1
look 1
brown 1
and 1
to 1
crackle 1
in 1
the 1
pan 1
and 1
Catherine 1
stood 1
by 1
with 1
a 1
fork 1
and 1
turned 1
it 1
then 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
herself 1
The 1
steak 1
is 1
almost 1
ready 1
I 1
may 1
as 1
well 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
cellar 1
for 1
the 1
ale 1
So 1
she 1
left 1
the 1
pan 1
on 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
large 1
jug 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
and 1
tapped 1
the 1
ale 1
cask 1
The 1
beer 1
ran 1
into 1
the 1
jug 1
and 1
Catherine 1
stood 1
looking 1
on 1
At 1
last 1
it 1
popped 1
into 1
her 1
head 1
The 1
dog 1
is 1
not 1
shut 1
up 1
he 1
may 1
be 1
running 1
away 1
with 1
the 1
steak 1
that 1
s 1
well 1
thought 1
of 1
So 1
up 1
she 1
ran 1
from 1
the 1
cellar 1
and 1
sure 1
enough 1
the 1
rascally 1
cur 1
had 1
got 1
the 1
steak 1
in 1
his 1
mouth 1
and 1
was 1
making 1
off 1
with 1
it 1
Away 1
ran 1
Catherine 1
and 1
away 1
ran 1
the 1
dog 1
across 1
the 1
field 1
but 1
he 1
ran 1
faster 1
than 1
she 1
and 1
stuck 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
steak 1
It 1
s 1
all 1
gone 1
and 1
what 1
can 1
t 1
be 1
cured 1
must 1
be 1
endured 1
said 1
Catherine 1
So 1
she 1
turned 1
round 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
run 1
a 1
good 1
way 1
and 1
was 1
tired 1
she 1
walked 1
home 1
leisurely 1
to 1
cool 1
herself 1
Now 1
all 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
ale 1
was 1
running 1
too 1
for 1
Catherine 1
had 1
not 1
turned 1
the 1
cock 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
jug 1
was 1
full 1
the 1
liquor 1
ran 1
upon 1
the 1
floor 1
till 1
the 1
cask 1
was 1
empty 1
When 1
she 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
cellar 1
stairs 1
she 1
saw 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
My 1
stars 1
said 1
she 1
what 1
shall 1
I 1
do 1
to 1
keep 1
Frederick 1
from 1
seeing 1
all 1
this 1
slopping 1
about 1
So 1
she 1
thought 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
remembered 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
sack 1
of 1
fine 1
meal 1
bought 1
at 1
the 1
last 1
fair 1
and 1
that 1
if 1
she 1
sprinkled 1
this 1
over 1
the 1
floor 1
it 1
would 1
suck 1
up 1
the 1
ale 1
nicely 1
What 1
a 1
lucky 1
thing 1
said 1
she 1
that 1
we 1
kept 1
that 1
meal 1
we 1
have 1
now 1
a 1
good 1
use 1
for 1
it 1
So 1
away 1
she 1
went 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
she 1
managed 1
to 1
set 1
it 1
down 1
just 1
upon 1
the 1
great 1
jug 1
full 1
of 1
beer 1
and 1
upset 1
it 1
and 1
thus 1
all 1
the 1
ale 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
saved 1
was 1
set 1
swimming 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
also 1
Ah 1
well 1
said 1
she 1
when 1
one 1
goes 1
another 1
may 1
as 1
well 1
follow 1
Then 1
she 1
strewed 1
the 1
meal 1
all 1
about 1
the 1
cellar 1
and 1
was 1
quite 1
pleased 1
with 1
her 1
cleverness 1
and 1
said 1
How 1
very 1
neat 1
and 1
clean 1
it 1
looks 1
At 1
noon 1
Frederick 1
came 1
home 1
Now 1
wife 1
cried 1
he 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
for 1
dinner 1
O 1
Frederick 1
answered 1
she 1
I 1
was 1
cooking 1
you 1
a 1
steak 1
but 1
while 1
I 1
went 1
down 1
to 1
draw 1
the 1
ale 1
the 1
dog 1
ran 1
away 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
while 1
I 1
ran 1
after 1
him 1
the 1
ale 1
ran 1
out 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
dry 1
up 1
the 1
ale 1
with 1
the 1
sack 1
of 1
meal 1
that 1
we 1
got 1
at 1
the 1
fair 1
I 1
upset 1
the 1
jug 1
but 1
the 1
cellar 1
is 1
now 1
quite 1
dry 1
and 1
looks 1
so 1
clean 1
Kate 2
said 1
he 1
how 1
could 1
you 1
do 1
all 1
this 1
Why 1
did 1
you 1
leave 1
the 1
steak 1
to 1
fry 1
and 1
the 1
ale 1
to 1
run 1
and 1
then 1
spoil 1
all 1
the 1
meal 1
Why 1
Frederick 1
said 1
she 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
I 1
was 1
doing 1
wrong 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
told 1
me 1
before 1
The 1
husband 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
If 1
my 1
wife 1
manages 1
matters 1
thus 1
I 1
must 1
look 1
sharp 1
myself 1
Now 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
of 1
gold 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
so 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
Catherine 1
What 1
pretty 1
yellow 1
buttons 1
these 1
are 1
I 1
shall 1
put 1
them 1
into 1
a 1
box 1
and 1
bury 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
but 1
take 1
care 1
that 1
you 1
never 1
go 1
near 1
or 1
meddle 1
with 1
them 1
No 1
Frederick 1
said 1
she 1
that 1
I 1
never 1
will 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
gone 1
there 1
came 1
by 1
some 1
pedlars 1
with 1
earthenware 1
plates 1
and 1
dishes 1
and 1
they 1
asked 1
her 1
whether 1
she 1
would 1
buy 1
Oh 1
dear 1
me 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
buy 1
very 1
much 1
but 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
money 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
any 1
use 1
for 1
yellow 1
buttons 1
I 1
might 1
deal 1
with 1
you 1
Yellow 1
buttons 1
said 1
they 1
let 1
us 1
have 1
a 1
look 1
at 1
them 1
Go 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
dig 1
where 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
the 1
yellow 1
buttons 1
I 1
dare 1
not 1
go 1
myself 1
So 1
the 1
rogues 1
went 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
found 1
what 1
these 1
yellow 1
buttons 1
were 1
they 1
took 1
them 1
all 1
away 1
and 1
left 1
her 1
plenty 1
of 1
plates 1
and 1
dishes 1
Then 1
she 1
set 1
them 1
all 1
about 1
the 1
house 1
for 1
a 1
show 1
and 1
when 1
Frederick 1
came 1
back 1
he 1
cried 1
out 1
Kate 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
been 1
doing 1
See 1
said 1
she 1
I 1
have 1
bought 1
all 1
these 1
with 1
your 1
yellow 1
buttons 1
but 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
touch 1
them 1
myself 1
the 1
pedlars 1
went 1
themselves 1
and 1
dug 1
them 1
up 1
Wife 1
wife 1
said 1
Frederick 1
what 1
a 1
pretty 1
piece 1
of 1
work 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
those 1
yellow 1
buttons 1
were 1
all 1
my 1
money 1
how 1
came 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
such 1
a 1
thing 1
Why 1
answered 1
she 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
there 1
was 1
any 1
harm 1
in 1
it 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
told 1
me 1
Catherine 1
stood 1
musing 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
husband 1
Hark 1
ye 1
Frederick 1
we 1
will 1
soon 1
get 1
the 1
gold 1
back 1
let 1
us 1
run 1
after 1
the 1
thieves 1
Well 1
we 1
will 1
try 1
answered 1
he 1
but 1
take 1
some 1
butter 1
and 1
cheese 1
with 1
you 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
have 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
Very 1
well 1
said 1
she 1
and 1
they 1
set 1
out 1
and 1
as 1
Frederick 1
walked 1
the 1
fastest 1
he 1
left 1
his 1
wife 1
some 1
way 1
behind 1
It 1
does 1
not 1
matter 1
thought 1
she 1
when 1
we 1
turn 1
back 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
so 1
much 1
nearer 1
home 1
than 1
he 1
Presently 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
a 1
hill 1
down 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
which 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
road 1
so 1
narrow 1
that 1
the 1
cart 1
wheels 1
always 1
chafed 1
the 1
trees 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
as 1
they 1
passed 1
Ah 1
see 1
now 1
said 1
she 1
how 1
they 1
have 1
bruised 1
and 1
wounded 1
those 1
poor 1
trees 1
they 1
will 1
never 1
get 1
well 1
So 1
she 1
took 1
pity 1
on 1
them 1
and 1
made 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
butter 1
to 1
grease 1
them 1
all 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
wheels 1
might 1
not 1
hurt 1
them 1
so 1
much 1
While 1
she 1
was 1
doing 1
this 1
kind 1
office 1
one 1
of 1
her 1
cheeses 1
fell 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
basket 1
and 1
rolled 1
down 1
the 1
hill 1
Catherine 1
looked 1
but 1
could 1
not 1
see 1
where 1
it 1
had 1
gone 1
so 1
she 1
said 1
Well 1
I 1
suppose 1
the 1
other 1
will 1
go 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
and 1
find 1
you 1
he 1
has 1
younger 1
legs 1
than 1
I 1
have 1
Then 1
she 1
rolled 1
the 1
other 1
cheese 1
after 1
it 1
and 1
away 1
it 1
went 1
nobody 1
knows 1
where 1
down 1
the 1
hill 1
But 1
she 1
said 1
she 1
supposed 1
that 1
they 1
knew 1
the 1
road 1
and 1
would 1
follow 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
stay 1
there 1
all 1
day 1
waiting 1
for 1
them 1
At 1
last 1
she 1
overtook 1
Frederick 1
who 1
desired 1
her 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
Then 1
she 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
dry 1
bread 1
Where 1
are 1
the 1
butter 1
and 1
cheese 1
said 1
he 1
Oh 1
answered 1
she 1
I 1
used 1
the 1
butter 1
to 1
grease 1
those 1
poor 1
trees 1
that 1
the 1
wheels 1
chafed 1
so 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
cheeses 1
ran 1
away 1
so 1
I 1
sent 1
the 1
other 1
after 1
it 1
to 1
find 1
it 1
and 1
I 1
suppose 1
they 1
are 1
both 1
on 1
the 1
road 1
together 1
somewhere 1
What 1
a 1
goose 1
you 1
are 1
to 1
do 1
such 1
silly 1
things 1
said 1
the 1
husband 1
How 1
can 1
you 1
say 1
so 1
said 1
she 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
you 1
never 1
told 1
me 1
not 1
They 1
ate 1
the 1
dry 1
bread 1
together 1
and 1
Frederick 1
said 1
Kate 1
I 1
hope 1
you 1
locked 1
the 1
door 1
safe 1
when 1
you 1
came 1
away 1
No 1
answered 1
she 1
you 1
did 1
not 1
tell 1
me 1
Then 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
do 1
it 1
now 1
before 1
we 1
go 1
any 1
farther 1
said 1
Frederick 1
and 1
bring 1
with 1
you 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
Catherine 1
did 1
as 1
he 1
told 1
her 1
and 1
thought 1
to 1
herself 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
Frederick 1
wants 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
but 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
he 1
is 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
butter 1
and 1
cheese 1
I 1
ll 1
bring 1
him 1
a 1
bag 1
of 1
fine 1
nuts 1
and 1
the 1
vinegar 1
for 1
I 1
have 1
often 1
seen 1
him 1
take 1
some 1
When 1
she 1
reached 1
home 1
she 1
bolted 1
the 1
back 1
door 1
but 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
she 1
took 1
off 1
the 1
hinges 1
and 1
said 1
Frederick 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
lock 1
the 1
door 1
but 1
surely 1
it 1
can 1
nowhere 1
be 1
so 1
safe 1
if 1
I 1
take 1
it 1
with 1
me 1
So 1
she 1
took 1
her 1
time 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
overtook 1
her 1
husband 1
she 1
cried 1
out 1
There 1
Frederick 1
there 1
is 1
the 1
door 1
itself 1
you 1
may 1
watch 1
it 1
as 1
carefully 1
as 1
you 1
please 1
Alas 1
alas 1
said 1
he 1
what 1
a 1
clever 1
wife 1
I 1
have 1
I 1
sent 1
you 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
house 1
fast 1
and 1
you 1
take 1
the 1
door 1
away 1
so 1
that 1
everybody 1
may 1
go 1
in 1
and 1
out 1
as 1
they 1
please 1
however 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
brought 1
the 1
door 1
you 1
shall 1
carry 1
it 1
about 1
with 1
you 1
for 1
your 1
pains 1
Very 1
well 1
answered 1
she 1
I 1
ll 1
carry 1
the 1
door 1
but 1
I 1
ll 1
not 1
carry 1
the 1
nuts 1
and 1
vinegar 1
bottle 1
also 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
too 1
much 1
of 1
a 1
load 1
so 1
if 1
you 1
please 1
I 1
ll 1
fasten 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
Frederick 1
of 1
course 1
made 1
no 1
objection 1
to 1
that 1
plan 1
and 1
they 1
set 1
off 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
to 1
look 1
for 1
the 1
thieves 1
but 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
them 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
grew 1
dark 1
they 1
climbed 1
up 1
into 1
a 1
tree 1
to 1
spend 1
the 1
night 1
there 1
Scarcely 1
were 1
they 1
up 1
than 1
who 1
should 1
come 1
by 1
but 1
the 1
very 1
rogues 1
they 1
were 1
looking 1
for 1
They 1
were 1
in 1
truth 1
great 1
rascals 1
and 1
belonged 1
to 1
that 1
class 1
of 1
people 1
who 1
find 1
things 1
before 1
they 1
are 1
lost 1
they 1
were 1
tired 1
so 1
they 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
fire 1
under 1
the 1
very 1
tree 1
where 1
Frederick 1
and 1
Catherine 1
were 1
Frederick 1
slipped 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
and 1
picked 1
up 1
some 1
stones 1
Then 1
he 1
climbed 1
up 1
again 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
hit 1
the 1
thieves 1
on 1
the 1
head 1
with 1
them 1
but 1
they 1
only 1
said 1
It 1
must 1
be 1
near 1
morning 1
for 1
the 1
wind 1
shakes 1
the 1
fir 1
apples 1
down 1
Catherine 1
who 1
had 1
the 1
door 1
on 1
her 1
shoulder 1
began 1
to 1
be 1
very 1
tired 1
but 1
she 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
nuts 1
upon 1
it 1
that 1
were 1
so 1
heavy 1
so 1
she 1
said 1
softly 1
Frederick 1
I 1
must 1
let 1
the 1
nuts 1
go 1
No 1
answered 1
he 1
not 1
now 1
they 1
will 1
discover 1
us 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
help 1
that 1
they 1
must 1
go 1
Well 1
then 1
make 1
haste 1
and 1
throw 1
them 1
down 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
Then 1
away 1
rattled 1
the 1
nuts 1
down 1
among 1
the 1
boughs 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
thieves 1
cried 1
Bless 1
me 1
it 1
is 1
hailing 1
A 1
little 1
while 1
after 1
Catherine 1
thought 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
still 1
very 1
heavy 1
so 1
she 1
whispered 1
to 1
Frederick 1
I 1
must 1
throw 1
the 1
vinegar 1
down 1
Pray 1
don 1
t 1
answered 1
he 1
it 1
will 1
discover 1
us 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
help 1
that 1
said 1
she 1
go 1
it 1
must 1
So 1
she 1
poured 1
all 1
the 1
vinegar 1
down 1
and 1
the 1
thieves 1
said 1
What 1
a 1
heavy 1
dew 1
there 1
is 1
At 1
last 1
it 1
popped 1
into 1
Catherine 1
s 1
head 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
door 1
itself 1
that 1
was 1
so 1
heavy 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
so 1
she 1
whispered 1
Frederick 1
I 1
must 1
throw 1
the 1
door 1
down 1
soon 1
But 1
he 1
begged 1
and 1
prayed 1
her 1
not 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
sure 1
it 1
would 1
betray 1
them 1
Here 1
goes 1
however 1
said 1
she 1
and 1
down 1
went 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
clatter 1
upon 1
the 1
thieves 1
that 1
they 1
cried 1
out 1
Murder 1
and 1
not 1
knowing 1
what 1
was 1
coming 1
ran 1
away 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
and 1
left 1
all 1
the 1
gold 1
So 1
when 1
Frederick 1
and 1
Catherine 1
came 1
down 1
there 1
they 1
found 1
all 1
their 1
money 1
safe 1
and 1
sound 1
SWEETHEART 1
ROLAND 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
a 1
woman 1
who 1
was 1
a 1
real 1
witch 1
and 1
had 1
two 1
daughters 1
one 1
ugly 1
and 1
wicked 1
and 1
this 1
one 1
she 1
loved 1
because 1
she 1
was 1
her 1
own 1
daughter 1
and 1
one 1
beautiful 1
and 1
good 1
and 1
this 1
one 1
she 1
hated 1
because 1
she 1
was 1
her 1
stepdaughter 1
The 1
stepdaughter 1
once 1
had 1
a 1
pretty 1
apron 1
which 1
the 1
other 1
fancied 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
she 1
became 1
envious 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
mother 1
that 1
she 1
must 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
that 1
apron 1
Be 1
quiet 1
my 1
child 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
have 1
it 1
Your 1
stepsister 1
has 1
long 1
deserved 1
death 1
tonight 1
when 1
she 1
is 1
asleep 1
I 1
will 1
come 1
and 1
cut 1
her 1
head 1
off 1
Only 1
be 1
careful 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
at 1
the 1
far 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
and 1
push 1
her 1
well 1
to 1
the 1
front 1
It 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
all 1
over 1
with 1
the 1
poor 1
girl 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
not 1
just 1
then 1
been 1
standing 1
in 1
a 1
corner 1
and 1
heard 1
everything 1
All 1
day 1
long 1
she 1
dared 1
not 1
go 1
out 1
of 1
doors 1
and 1
when 1
bedtime 1
had 1
come 1
the 1
witch 1
s 1
daughter 1
got 1
into 1
bed 1
first 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
lie 1
at 1
the 1
far 1
side 1
but 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
asleep 1
the 1
other 1
pushed 1
her 1
gently 1
to 1
the 1
front 1
and 1
took 1
for 1
herself 1
the 1
place 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
close 1
by 1
the 1
wall 1
In 1
the 1
night 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
came 1
creeping 1
in 1
she 1
held 1
an 1
axe 1
in 1
her 1
right 1
hand 1
and 1
felt 1
with 1
her 1
left 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
anyone 1
were 1
lying 1
at 1
the 1
outside 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
grasped 1
the 1
axe 1
with 1
both 1
hands 1
and 1
cut 1
her 1
own 1
child 1
s 1
head 1
off 1
When 1
she 1
had 1
gone 1
away 1
the 1
girl 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
her 1
sweetheart 1
who 1
was 1
called 1
Roland 1
and 1
knocked 1
at 1
his 1
door 1
When 1
he 1
came 1
out 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
Listen 1
dearest 1
Roland 1
we 1
must 1
fly 1
in 1
all 1
haste 1
my 1
stepmother 1
wanted 1
to 1
kill 1
me 1
but 1
has 1
struck 1
her 1
own 1
child 1
When 1
daylight 1
comes 1
and 1
she 1
sees 1
what 1
she 1
has 1
done 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
lost 1
But 1
said 1
Roland 1
I 1
counsel 1
you 1
first 1
to 1
take 1
away 1
her 1
magic 1
wand 1
or 1
we 1
cannot 1
escape 1
if 1
she 1
pursues 1
us 1
The 1
maiden 1
fetched 1
the 1
magic 1
wand 1
and 1
she 1
took 1
the 1
dead 1
girl 1
s 1
head 1
and 1
dropped 1
three 1
drops 1
of 1
blood 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
one 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
one 1
on 1
the 1
stairs 1
Then 1
she 1
hurried 1
away 1
with 1
her 1
lover 1
When 1
the 1
old 1
witch 1
got 1
up 1
next 1
morning 1
she 1
called 1
her 1
daughter 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
give 1
her 1
the 1
apron 1
but 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
Then 1
the 1
witch 1
cried 1
Where 1
are 1
you 1
Here 1
on 1
the 1
stairs 1
I 1
am 1
sweeping 1
answered 1
the 1
first 1
drop 1
of 1
blood 1
The 1
old 1
woman 1
went 1
out 1
but 1
saw 1
no 1
one 1
on 1
the 1
stairs 1
and 1
cried 1
again 1
Where 1
are 1
you 1
Here 1
in 1
the 1
kitchen 1
I 1
am 1
warming 1
myself 1
cried 1
the 1
second 1
drop 1
of 1
blood 1
She 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
but 1
found 1
no 1
one 1
Then 1
she 1
cried 1
again 1
Where 1
are 1
you 1
Ah 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
bed 1
I 1
am 1
sleeping 1
cried 1
the 1
third 1
drop 1
of 1
blood 1
She 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
to 1
the 1
bed 1
What 1
did 1
she 1
see 1
there 1
Her 1
own 1
child 1
whose 1
head 1
she 1
had 1
cut 1
off 1
bathed 1
in 1
her 1
blood 1
The 1
witch 1
fell 1
into 1
a 1
passion 1
sprang 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
could 1
look 1
forth 1
quite 1
far 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
she 1
perceived 1
her 1
stepdaughter 1
hurrying 1
away 1
with 1
her 1
sweetheart 1
Roland 1
That 1
shall 1
not 1
help 1
you 1
cried 1
she 1
even 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
got 1
a 1
long 1
way 1
off 1
you 1
shall 1
still 1
not 1
escape 1
me 1
She 1
put 1
on 1
her 1
many 1
league 1
boots 1
in 1
which 1
she 1
covered 1
an 1
hour 1
s 1
walk 1
at 1
every 1
step 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
she 1
overtook 1
them 1
The 1
girl 1
however 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
striding 1
towards 1
her 1
changed 1
with 1
her 1
magic 1
wand 1
her 1
sweetheart 1
Roland 1
into 1
a 1
lake 1
and 1
herself 1
into 1
a 1
duck 1
swimming 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
it 1
The 1
witch 1
placed 1
herself 1
on 1
the 1
shore 1
threw 1
breadcrumbs 1
in 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
endless 1
trouble 1
to 1
entice 1
the 1
duck 1
but 1
the 1
duck 1
did 1
not 1
let 1
herself 1
be 1
enticed 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
had 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
at 1
night 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
come 1
At 1
this 1
the 1
girl 1
and 1
her 1
sweetheart 1
Roland 1
resumed 1
their 1
natural 1
shapes 1
again 1
and 1
they 1
walked 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
night 1
until 1
daybreak 1
Then 1
the 1
maiden 1
changed 1
herself 1
into 1
a 1
beautiful 1
flower 1
which 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
a 1
briar 1
hedge 1
and 1
her 1
sweetheart 1
Roland 1
into 1
a 1
fiddler 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
the 1
witch 1
came 1
striding 1
up 1
towards 1
them 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
musician 1
Dear 1
musician 1
may 1
I 1
pluck 1
that 1
beautiful 1
flower 1
for 1
myself 1
Oh 1
yes 1
he 1
replied 1
I 1
will 1
play 1
to 1
you 1
while 1
you 1
do 1
it 1
As 1
she 1
was 1
hastily 1
creeping 1
into 1
the 1
hedge 1
and 1
was 1
just 1
going 1
to 1
pluck 1
the 1
flower 1
knowing 1
perfectly 1
well 1
who 1
the 1
flower 1
was 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
play 1
and 1
whether 1
she 1
would 1
or 1
not 1
she 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
dance 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
magical 1
dance 1
The 1
faster 1
he 1
played 1
the 1
more 1
violent 1
springs 1
was 1
she 1
forced 1
to 1
make 1
and 1
the 1
thorns 1
tore 1
her 1
clothes 1
from 1
her 1
body 1
and 1
pricked 1
her 1
and 1
wounded 1
her 1
till 1
she 1
bled 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
stop 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
dance 1
till 1
she 1
lay 1
dead 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
As 1
they 1
were 1
now 1
set 1
free 1
Roland 1
said 1
Now 1
I 1
will 1
go 1
to 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
arrange 1
for 1
the 1
wedding 1
Then 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
I 1
will 1
stay 1
here 1
and 1
wait 1
for 1
you 1
said 1
the 1
girl 1
and 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
may 1
recognize 1
me 1
I 1
will 1
change 1
myself 1
into 1
a 1
red 1
stone 1
landmark 1
Then 1
Roland 1
went 1
away 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
stood 1
like 1
a 1
red 1
landmark 1
in 1
the 1
field 1
and 1
waited 1
for 1
her 1
beloved 1
But 1
when 1
Roland 1
got 1
home 1
he 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
snares 1
of 1
another 1
who 1
so 1
fascinated 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
forgot 1
the 1
maiden 1
The 1
poor 1
girl 1
remained 1
there 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
but 1
at 1
length 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
return 1
at 1
all 1
she 1
was 1
sad 1
and 1
changed 1
herself 1
into 1
a 1
flower 1
and 1
thought 1
Someone 1
will 1
surely 1
come 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
trample 1
me 1
down 1
It 1
befell 1
however 1
that 1
a 1
shepherd 1
kept 1
his 1
sheep 1
in 1
the 1
field 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
flower 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
pretty 1
plucked 1
it 1
took 1
it 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
laid 1
it 1
away 1
in 1
his 1
chest 1
From 1
that 1
time 1
forth 1
strange 1
things 1
happened 1
in 1
the 1
shepherd 1
s 1
house 1
When 1
he 1
arose 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
all 1
the 1
work 1
was 1
already 1
done 1
the 1
room 1
was 1
swept 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
benches 1
cleaned 1
the 1
fire 1
in 1
the 1
hearth 1
was 1
lighted 1
and 1
the 1
water 1
was 1
fetched 1
and 1
at 1
noon 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
home 1
the 1
table 1
was 1
laid 1
and 1
a 1
good 1
dinner 1
served 1
He 1
could 1
not 1
conceive 1
how 1
this 1
came 1
to 1
pass 1
for 1
he 1
never 1
saw 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
in 1
his 1
house 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
could 1
have 1
concealed 1
himself 1
in 1
it 1
He 1
was 1
certainly 1
pleased 1
with 1
this 1
good 1
attendance 1
but 1
still 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
afraid 1
that 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
a 1
wise 1
woman 1
and 1
asked 1
for 1
her 1
advice 1
The 1
wise 1
woman 1
said 1
There 1
is 1
some 1
enchantment 1
behind 1
it 1
listen 1
very 1
early 1
some 1
morning 1
if 1
anything 1
is 1
moving 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
see 1
anything 1
no 1
matter 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
throw 1
a 1
white 1
cloth 1
over 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
magic 1
will 1
be 1
stopped 1
The 1
shepherd 1
did 1
as 1
she 1
bade 1
him 1
and 1
next 1
morning 1
just 1
as 1
day 1
dawned 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
chest 1
open 1
and 1
the 1
flower 1
come 1
out 1
Swiftly 1
he 1
sprang 1
towards 1
it 1
and 1
threw 1
a 1
white 1
cloth 1
over 1
it 1
Instantly 1
the 1
transformation 1
came 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
and 1
a 1
beautiful 1
girl 1
stood 1
before 1
him 1
who 1
admitted 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
flower 1
and 1
that 1
up 1
to 1
this 1
time 1
she 1
had 1
attended 1
to 1
his 1
house 1
keeping 1
She 1
told 1
him 1
her 1
story 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
pleased 1
him 1
he 1
asked 1
her 1
if 1
she 1
would 1
marry 1
him 1
but 1
she 1
answered 1
No 1
for 1
she 1
wanted 1
to 1
remain 1
faithful 1
to 1
her 1
sweetheart 1
Roland 1
although 1
he 1
had 1
deserted 1
her 1
Nevertheless 1
she 1
promised 1
not 1
to 1
go 1
away 1
but 1
to 1
continue 1
keeping 1
house 1
for 1
the 1
shepherd 1
And 1
now 1
the 1
time 1
drew 1
near 1
when 1
Roland 1
s 1
wedding 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
celebrated 1
and 1
then 1
according 1
to 1
an 1
old 1
custom 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
it 1
was 1
announced 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
girls 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
present 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
sing 1
in 1
honour 1
of 1
the 1
bridal 1
pair 1
When 1
the 1
faithful 1
maiden 1
heard 1
of 1
this 1
she 1
grew 1
so 1
sad 1
that 1
she 1
thought 1
her 1
heart 1
would 1
break 1
and 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
go 1
thither 1
but 1
the 1
other 1
girls 1
came 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
When 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
her 1
turn 1
to 1
sing 1
she 1
stepped 1
back 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
she 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
left 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
refuse 1
But 1
when 1
she 1
began 1
her 1
song 1
and 1
it 1
reached 1
Roland 1
s 1
ears 1
he 1
sprang 1
up 1
and 1
cried 1
I 1
know 1
the 1
voice 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
true 1
bride 1
I 1
will 1
have 1
no 1
other 1
Everything 1
he 1
had 1
forgotten 1
and 1
which 1
had 1
vanished 1
from 1
his 1
mind 1
had 1
suddenly 1
come 1
home 1
again 1
to 1
his 1
heart 1
Then 1
the 1
faithful 1
maiden 1
held 1
her 1
wedding 1
with 1
her 1
sweetheart 1
Roland 1
and 1
grief 1
came 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
and 1
joy 1
began 1
SNOWDROP 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
winter 1
when 1
the 1
broad 1
flakes 1
of 1
snow 1
were 1
falling 1
around 1
that 1
the 1
queen 1
of 1
a 1
country 1
many 1
thousand 1
miles 1
off 1
sat 1
working 1
at 1
her 1
window 1
The 1
frame 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
was 1
made 1
of 1
fine 1
black 1
ebony 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
sat 1
looking 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
snow 1
she 1
pricked 1
her 1
finger 1
and 1
three 1
drops 1
of 1
blood 1
fell 1
upon 1
it 1
Then 1
she 1
gazed 1
thoughtfully 1
upon 1
the 1
red 1
drops 1
that 1
sprinkled 1
the 1
white 1
snow 1
and 1
said 1
Would 1
that 1
my 1
little 1
daughter 1
may 1
be 1
as 1
white 1
as 1
that 1
snow 1
as 1
red 1
as 1
that 1
blood 1
and 1
as 1
black 1
as 1
this 1
ebony 1
windowframe 1
And 1
so 1
the 1
little 1
girl 1
really 1
did 1
grow 1
up 1
her 1
skin 1
was 1
as 1
white 1
as 1
snow 1
her 1
cheeks 1
as 1
rosy 1
as 1
the 1
blood 1
and 1
her 1
hair 1
as 1
black 1
as 1
ebony 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
called 1
Snowdrop 1
But 1
this 1
queen 1
died 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
soon 1
married 1
another 1
wife 1
who 1
became 1
queen 1
and 1
was 1
very 1
beautiful 1
but 1
so 1
vain 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
anyone 1
could 1
be 1
handsomer 1
than 1
she 1
was 1
She 1
had 1
a 1
fairy 1
looking 1
glass 1
to 1
which 1
she 1
used 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
would 1
gaze 1
upon 1
herself 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
say 1
Tell 1
me 1
glass 1
tell 1
me 1
true 1
Of 1
all 1
the 1
ladies 1
in 1
the 1
land 1
Who 1
is 1
fairest 1
tell 1
me 1
who 1
And 1
the 1
glass 1
had 1
always 1
answered 1
Thou 1
queen 1
art 1
the 1
fairest 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
land 1
But 1
Snowdrop 1
grew 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
beautiful 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
seven 1
years 1
old 1
she 1
was 1
as 1
bright 1
as 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
fairer 1
than 1
the 1
queen 1
herself 1
Then 1
the 1
glass 1
one 1
day 1
answered 1
the 1
queen 1
when 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
look 1
in 1
it 1
as 1
usual 1
Thou 1
queen 1
art 1
fair 1
and 1
beauteous 1
to 1
see 1
But 1
Snowdrop 1
is 1
lovelier 1
far 1
than 1
thee 1
When 1
she 1
heard 1
this 1
she 1
turned 1
pale 1
with 1
rage 1
and 1
envy 1
and 1
called 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
her 1
servants 1
and 1
said 1
Take 1
Snowdrop 1
away 1
into 1
the 1
wide 1
wood 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
never 1
see 1
her 1
any 1
more 1
Then 1
the 1
servant 1
led 1
her 1
away 1
but 1
his 1
heart 1
melted 1
when 1
Snowdrop 1
begged 1
him 1
to 1
spare 1
her 1
life 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
hurt 1
you 1
thou 1
pretty 1
child 1
So 1
he 1
left 1
her 1
by 1
herself 1
and 1
though 1
he 1
thought 1
it 1
most 1
likely 1
that 1
the 1
wild 1
beasts 1
would 1
tear 1
her 1
in 1
pieces 1
he 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
a 1
great 1
weight 1
were 1
taken 1
off 1
his 1
heart 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
made 1
up 1
his 1
mind 1
not 1
to 1
kill 1
her 1
but 1
to 1
leave 1
her 1
to 1
her 1
fate 1
with 1
the 1
chance 1
of 1
someone 1
finding 1
and 1
saving 1
her 1
Then 1
poor 1
Snowdrop 1
wandered 1
along 1
through 1
the 1
wood 1
in 1
great 1
fear 1
and 1
the 1
wild 1
beasts 1
roared 1
about 1
her 1
but 1
none 1
did 1
her 1
any 1
harm 1
In 1
the 1
evening 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
cottage 1
among 1
the 1
hills 1
and 1
went 1
in 1
to 1
rest 1
for 1
her 1
little 1
feet 1
would 1
carry 1
her 1
no 1
further 1
Everything 1
was 1
spruce 1
and 1
neat 1
in 1
the 1
cottage 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
was 1
spread 1
a 1
white 1
cloth 1
and 1
there 1
were 1
seven 1
little 1
plates 1
seven 1
little 1
loaves 1
and 1
seven 1
little 1
glasses 1
with 1
wine 1
in 1
them 1
and 1
seven 1
knives 1
and 1
forks 1
laid 1
in 1
order 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
wall 1
stood 1
seven 1
little 1
beds 1
As 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
hungry 1
she 1
picked 1
a 1
little 1
piece 1
of 1
each 1
loaf 1
and 1
drank 1
a 1
very 1
little 1
wine 1
out 1
of 1
each 1
glass 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
she 1
thought 1
she 1
would 1
lie 1
down 1
and 1
rest 1
So 1
she 1
tried 1
all 1
the 1
little 1
beds 1
but 1
one 1
was 1
too 1
long 1
and 1
another 1
was 1
too 1
short 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
seventh 1
suited 1
her 1
and 1
there 1
she 1
laid 1
herself 1
down 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
sleep 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
in 1
came 1
the 1
masters 1
of 1
the 1
cottage 1
Now 1
they 1
were 1
seven 1
little 1
dwarfs 1
that 1
lived 1
among 1
the 1
mountains 1
and 1
dug 1
and 1
searched 1
for 1
gold 1
They 1
lighted 1
up 1
their 1
seven 1
lamps 1
and 1
saw 1
at 1
once 1
that 1
all 1
was 1
not 1
right 1
The 1
first 1
said 1
Who 1
has 1
been 1
sitting 1
on 1
my 1
stool 1
The 1
second 1
Who 1
has 1
been 1
eating 1
off 1
my 1
plate 1
The 1
third 1
Who 1
has 1
been 1
picking 1
my 1
bread 1
The 1
fourth 1
Who 1
has 1
been 1
meddling 1
with 1
my 1
spoon 1
The 1
fifth 1
Who 1
has 1
been 1
handling 1
my 1
fork 1
The 1
sixth 1
Who 1
has 1
been 1
cutting 1
with 1
my 1
knife 1
The 1
seventh 1
Who 1
has 1
been 1
drinking 1
my 1
wine 1
Then 1
the 1
first 1
looked 1
round 1
and 1
said 1
Who 1
has 1
been 1
lying 1
on 1
my 1
bed 1
And 1
the 1
rest 1
came 1
running 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
everyone 1
cried 1
out 1
that 1
somebody 1
had 1
been 1
upon 1
his 1
bed 1
But 1
the 1
seventh 1
saw 1
Snowdrop 1
and 1
called 1
all 1
his 1
brethren 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
see 1
her 1
and 1
they 1
cried 1
out 1
with 1
wonder 1
and 1
astonishment 1
and 1
brought 1
their 1
lamps 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
Good 1
heavens 1
what 1
a 1
lovely 1
child 1
she 1
is 1
And 1
they 1
were 1
very 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
and 1
took 1
care 1
not 1
to 1
wake 1
her 1
and 1
the 1
seventh 1
dwarf 1
slept 1
an 1
hour 1
with 1
each 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
dwarfs 1
in 1
turn 1
till 1
the 1
night 1
was 1
gone 1
In 1
the 1
morning 1
Snowdrop 1
told 1
them 1
all 1
her 1
story 1
and 1
they 1
pitied 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
if 1
she 1
would 1
keep 1
all 1
things 1
in 1
order 1
and 1
cook 1
and 1
wash 1
and 1
knit 1
and 1
spin 1
for 1
them 1
she 1
might 1
stay 1
where 1
she 1
was 1
and 1
they 1
would 1
take 1
good 1
care 1
of 1
her 1
Then 1
they 1
went 1
out 1
all 1
day 1
long 1
to 1
their 1
work 1
seeking 1
for 1
gold 1
and 1
silver 1
in 1
the 1
mountains 1
but 1
Snowdrop 1
was 1
left 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
they 1
warned 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
The 1
queen 1
will 1
soon 1
find 1
out 1
where 1
you 1
are 1
so 1
take 1
care 1
and 1
let 1
no 1
one 1
in 1
But 1
the 1
queen 1
now 1
that 1
she 1
thought 1
Snowdrop 1
was 1
dead 1
believed 1
that 1
she 1
must 1
be 1
the 1
handsomest 1
lady 1
in 1
the 1
land 1
and 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
her 1
glass 1
and 1
said 1
Tell 1
me 1
glass 1
tell 1
me 1
true 1
Of 1
all 1
the 1
ladies 1
in 1
the 1
land 1
Who 1
is 1
fairest 1
tell 1
me 1
who 1
And 1
the 1
glass 1
answered 1
Thou 1
queen 1
art 1
the 1
fairest 1
in 1
all 1
this 1
land 1
But 1
over 1
the 1
hills 1
in 1
the 1
greenwood 1
shade 1
Where 1
the 1
seven 1
dwarfs 1
their 1
dwelling 1
have 1
made 1
There 1
Snowdrop 1
is 1
hiding 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
she 1
Is 1
lovelier 1
far 1
O 1
queen 1
than 1
thee 1
Then 1
the 1
queen 1
was 1
very 1
much 1
frightened 1
for 1
she 1
knew 1
that 1
the 1
glass 1
always 1
spoke 1
the 1
truth 1
and 1
was 1
sure 1
that 1
the 1
servant 1
had 1
betrayed 1
her 1
And 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
anyone 1
lived 1
who 1
was 1
more 1
beautiful 1
than 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
she 1
dressed 1
herself 1
up 1
as 1
an 1
old 1
pedlar 1
and 1
went 1
her 1
way 1
over 1
the 1
hills 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
the 1
dwarfs 1
dwelt 1
Then 1
she 1
knocked 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
cried 1
Fine 1
wares 1
to 1
sell 1
Snowdrop 1
looked 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
said 1
Good 1
day 1
good 1
woman 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
to 1
sell 1
Good 1
wares 1
fine 1
wares 1
said 1
she 1
laces 1
and 1
bobbins 1
of 1
all 1
colours 1
I 1
will 1
let 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
in 1
she 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
very 1
good 1
sort 1
of 1
body 1
thought 1
Snowdrop 1
as 1
she 1
ran 1
down 1
and 1
unbolted 1
the 1
door 1
Bless 1
me 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
how 1
badly 1
your 1
stays 1
are 1
laced 1
Let 1
me 1
lace 1
them 1
up 1
with 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
nice 1
new 1
laces 1
Snowdrop 1
did 1
not 1
dream 1
of 1
any 1
mischief 1
so 1
she 1
stood 1
before 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
but 1
she 1
set 1
to 1
work 1
so 1
nimbly 1
and 1
pulled 1
the 1
lace 1
so 1
tight 1
that 1
Snowdrop 1
s 1
breath 1
was 1
stopped 1
and 1
she 1
fell 1
down 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
were 1
dead 1
There 1
s 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
all 1
thy 1
beauty 1
said 1
the 1
spiteful 1
queen 1
and 1
went 1
away 1
home 1
In 1
the 1
evening 1
the 1
seven 1
dwarfs 1
came 1
home 1
and 1
I 1
need 1
not 1
say 1
how 1
grieved 1
they 1
were 1
to 1
see 1
their 1
faithful 1
Snowdrop 1
stretched 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
was 1
quite 1
dead 1
However 1
they 1
lifted 1
her 1
up 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
found 1
what 1
ailed 1
her 1
they 1
cut 1
the 1
lace 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
time 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
breathe 1
and 1
very 1
soon 1
came 1
to 1
life 1
again 1
Then 1
they 1
said 1
The 1
old 1
woman 1
was 1
the 1
queen 1
herself 1
take 1
care 1
another 1
time 1
and 1
let 1
no 1
one 1
in 1
when 1
we 1
are 1
away 1
When 1
the 1
queen 1
got 1
home 1
she 1
went 1
straight 1
to 1
her 1
glass 1
and 1
spoke 1
to 1
it 1
as 1
before 1
but 1
to 1
her 1
great 1
grief 1
it 1
still 1
said 1
Thou 1
queen 1
art 1
the 1
fairest 1
in 1
all 1
this 1
land 1
But 1
over 1
the 1
hills 1
in 1
the 1
greenwood 1
shade 1
Where 1
the 1
seven 1
dwarfs 1
their 1
dwelling 1
have 1
made 1
There 1
Snowdrop 1
is 1
hiding 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
she 1
Is 1
lovelier 1
far 1
O 1
queen 1
than 1
thee 1
Then 1
the 1
blood 1
ran 1
cold 1
in 1
her 1
heart 1
with 1
spite 1
and 1
malice 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
Snowdrop 1
still 1
lived 1
and 1
she 1
dressed 1
herself 1
up 1
again 1
but 1
in 1
quite 1
another 1
dress 1
from 1
the 1
one 1
she 1
wore 1
before 1
and 1
took 1
with 1
her 1
a 1
poisoned 1
comb 1
When 1
she 1
reached 1
the 1
dwarfs 1
cottage 1
she 1
knocked 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
cried 1
Fine 1
wares 1
to 1
sell 1
But 1
Snowdrop 1
said 1
I 1
dare 1
not 1
let 1
anyone 1
in 1
Then 1
the 1
queen 1
said 1
Only 1
look 1
at 1
my 1
beautiful 1
combs 1
and 1
gave 1
her 1
the 1
poisoned 1
one 1
And 1
it 1
looked 1
so 1
pretty 1
that 1
she 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
her 1
hair 1
to 1
try 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
moment 1
it 1
touched 1
her 1
head 1
the 1
poison 1
was 1
so 1
powerful 1
that 1
she 1
fell 1
down 1
senseless 1
There 1
you 1
may 1
lie 1
said 1
the 1
queen 1
and 1
went 1
her 1
way 1
But 1
by 1
good 1
luck 1
the 1
dwarfs 1
came 1
in 1
very 1
early 1
that 1
evening 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
saw 1
Snowdrop 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
they 1
thought 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
and 1
soon 1
found 1
the 1
poisoned 1
comb 1
And 1
when 1
they 1
took 1
it 1
away 1
she 1
got 1
well 1
and 1
told 1
them 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
passed 1
and 1
they 1
warned 1
her 1
once 1
more 1
not 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
anyone 1
Meantime 1
the 1
queen 1
went 1
home 1
to 1
her 1
glass 1
and 1
shook 1
with 1
rage 1
when 1
she 1
read 1
the 1
very 1
same 1
answer 1
as 1
before 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
Snowdrop 1
shall 1
die 1
if 1
it 1
cost 1
me 1
my 1
life 1
So 1
she 1
went 1
by 1
herself 1
into 1
her 1
chamber 1
and 1
got 1
ready 1
a 1
poisoned 1
apple 1
the 1
outside 1
looked 1
very 1
rosy 1
and 1
tempting 1
but 1
whoever 1
tasted 1
it 1
was 1
sure 1
to 1
die 1
Then 1
she 1
dressed 1
herself 1
up 1
as 1
a 1
peasant 1
s 1
wife 1
and 1
travelled 1
over 1
the 1
hills 1
to 1
the 1
dwarfs 1
cottage 1
and 1
knocked 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
but 1
Snowdrop 1
put 1
her 1
head 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
dare 1
not 1
let 1
anyone 1
in 1
for 1
the 1
dwarfs 1
have 1
told 1
me 1
not 1
Do 1
as 1
you 1
please 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
but 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
take 1
this 1
pretty 1
apple 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
it 1
you 1
No 1
said 1
Snowdrop 1
I 1
dare 1
not 1
take 1
it 1
You 1
silly 1
girl 1
answered 1
the 1
other 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
afraid 1
of 1
Do 1
you 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
poisoned 1
Come 1
do 1
you 1
eat 1
one 1
part 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
eat 1
the 1
other 1
Now 1
the 1
apple 1
was 1
so 1
made 1
up 1
that 1
one 1
side 1
was 1
good 1
though 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
was 1
poisoned 1
Then 1
Snowdrop 1
was 1
much 1
tempted 1
to 1
taste 1
for 1
the 1
apple 1
looked 1
so 1
very 1
nice 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
eat 1
she 1
could 1
wait 1
no 1
longer 1
But 1
she 1
had 1
scarcely 1
put 1
the 1
piece 1
into 1
her 1
mouth 1
when 1
she 1
fell 1
down 1
dead 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
This 1
time 1
nothing 1
will 1
save 1
thee 1
said 1
the 1
queen 1
and 1
she 1
went 1
home 1
to 1
her 1
glass 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
it 1
said 1
Thou 1
queen 1
art 1
the 1
fairest 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
fair 1
And 1
then 1
her 1
wicked 1
heart 1
was 1
glad 1
and 1
as 1
happy 1
as 1
such 1
a 1
heart 1
could 1
be 1
When 1
evening 1
came 1
and 1
the 1
dwarfs 1
had 1
gone 1
home 1
they 1
found 1
Snowdrop 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
no 1
breath 1
came 1
from 1
her 1
lips 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
afraid 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
quite 1
dead 1
They 1
lifted 1
her 1
up 1
and 1
combed 1
her 1
hair 1
and 1
washed 1
her 1
face 1
with 1
wine 1
and 1
water 1
but 1
all 1
was 1
in 1
vain 1
for 1
the 1
little 1
girl 1
seemed 1
quite 1
dead 1
So 1
they 1
laid 1
her 1
down 1
upon 1
a 1
bier 1
and 1
all 1
seven 1
watched 1
and 1
bewailed 1
her 1
three 1
whole 1
days 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
thought 1
they 1
would 1
bury 1
her 1
but 1
her 1
cheeks 1
were 1
still 1
rosy 1
and 1
her 1
face 1
looked 1
just 1
as 1
it 1
did 1
while 1
she 1
was 1
alive 1
so 1
they 1
said 1
We 1
will 1
never 1
bury 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
cold 1
ground 1
And 1
they 1
made 1
a 1
coffin 1
of 1
glass 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
still 1
look 1
at 1
her 1
and 1
wrote 1
upon 1
it 1
in 1
golden 1
letters 1
what 1
her 1
name 1
was 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
And 1
the 1
coffin 1
was 1
set 1
among 1
the 1
hills 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
dwarfs 1
always 1
sat 1
by 1
it 1
and 1
watched 1
And 1
the 1
birds 1
of 1
the 1
air 1
came 1
too 1
and 1
bemoaned 1
Snowdrop 1
and 1
first 1
of 1
all 1
came 1
an 1
owl 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
raven 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
a 1
dove 1
and 1
sat 1
by 1
her 1
side 1
And 1
thus 1
Snowdrop 1
lay 1
for 1
a 1
long 2
time 1
and 1
still 1
only 1
looked 1
as 1
though 1
she 1
was 1
asleep 1
for 1
she 1
was 1
even 1
now 1
as 1
white 1
as 1
snow 1
and 1
as 1
red 1
as 1
blood 1
and 1
as 1
black 1
as 1
ebony 1
At 1
last 1
a 1
prince 1
came 1
and 1
called 1
at 1
the 1
dwarfs 1
house 1
and 1
he 1
saw 1
Snowdrop 1
and 1
read 1
what 1
was 1
written 1
in 1
golden 1
letters 1
Then 1
he 1
offered 1
the 1
dwarfs 1
money 1
and 1
prayed 1
and 1
besought 1
them 1
to 1
let 1
him 1
take 1
her 1
away 1
but 1
they 1
said 1
We 1
will 1
not 1
part 1
with 1
her 1
for 1
all 1
the 1
gold 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
At 1
last 1
however 1
they 1
had 1
pity 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
coffin 1
but 1
the 1
moment 1
he 1
lifted 1
it 1
up 1
to 1
carry 1
it 1
home 1
with 1
him 1
the 1
piece 1
of 1
apple 1
fell 1
from 1
between 1
her 1
lips 1
and 1
Snowdrop 1
awoke 1
and 1
said 1
Where 1
am 1
I 1
And 1
the 1
prince 1
said 1
Thou 1
art 1
quite 1
safe 1
with 1
me 1
Then 1
he 1
told 1
her 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
happened 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
love 1
you 1
far 1
better 1
than 1
all 1
the 1
world 1
so 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
to 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
palace 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
be 1
my 1
wife 1
And 1
Snowdrop 1
consented 1
and 1
went 1
home 1
with 1
the 1
prince 1
and 1
everything 1
was 1
got 1
ready 1
with 1
great 1
pomp 1
and 1
splendour 1
for 1
their 1
wedding 1
To 1
the 1
feast 1
was 1
asked 1
among 1
the 1
rest 1
Snowdrop 1
s 1
old 1
enemy 1
the 1
queen 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
dressing 1
herself 1
in 1
fine 1
rich 1
clothes 1
she 1
looked 1
in 1
the 1
glass 1
and 1
said 1
Tell 1
me 1
glass 1
tell 1
me 1
true 1
Of 1
all 1
the 1
ladies 1
in 1
the 1
land 1
Who 1
is 1
fairest 1
tell 1
me 1
who 1
And 1
the 1
glass 1
answered 1
Thou 1
lady 1
art 1
loveliest 1
here 1
I 1
ween 1
But 1
lovelier 1
far 1
is 1
the 1
new 1
made 1
queen 1
When 1
she 1
heard 1
this 1
she 1
started 1
with 1
rage 1
but 1
her 1
envy 1
and 1
curiosity 1
were 1
so 1
great 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
setting 1
out 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
bride 1
And 1
when 1
she 1
got 1
there 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
other 1
than 1
Snowdrop 1
who 1
as 1
she 1
thought 1
had 1
been 1
dead 1
a 1
long 1
while 1
she 1
choked 1
with 1
rage 1
and 1
fell 1
down 1
and 1
died 1
but 1
Snowdrop 1
and 1
the 1
prince 1
lived 1
and 1
reigned 1
happily 1
over 1
that 1
land 1
many 2
years 1
and 1
sometimes 1
they 1
went 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
mountains 1
and 1
paid 1
a 1
visit 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
dwarfs 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
so 1
kind 1
to 1
Snowdrop 1
in 1
her 1
time 1
of 1
need 1
THE 1
PINK 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
a 1
queen 1
to 1
whom 1
God 1
had 1
given 1
no 1
children 1
Every 1
morning 1
she 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
prayed 1
to 1
God 1
in 1
heaven 1
to 1
bestow 1
on 1
her 1
a 1
son 1
or 1
a 1
daughter 1
Then 1
an 1
angel 1
from 1
heaven 1
came 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
Be 1
at 1
rest 1
you 1
shall 1
have 1
a 1
son 1
with 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
wishing 1
so 1
that 1
whatsoever 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
he 1
wishes 1
for 1
that 1
shall 1
he 1
have 1
Then 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
the 1
joyful 1
tidings 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
time 1
was 1
come 1
she 1
gave 1
birth 1
to 1
a 1
son 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
gladness 1
Every 1
morning 1
she 1
went 1
with 1
the 1
child 1
to 1
the 1
garden 1
where 1
the 1
wild 1
beasts 1
were 1
kept 1
and 1
washed 1
herself 1
there 1
in 1
a 1
clear 1
stream 1
It 1
happened 1
once 1
when 1
the 1
child 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
older 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
lying 1
in 1
her 1
arms 1
and 1
she 1
fell 1
asleep 1
Then 1
came 1
the 1
old 1
cook 1
who 1
knew 1
that 1
the 1
child 1
had 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
wishing 1
and 1
stole 1
it 1
away 1
and 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
hen 1
and 1
cut 1
it 1
in 1
pieces 1
and 1
dropped 1
some 1
of 1
its 1
blood 1
on 1
the 1
queen 1
s 1
apron 1
and 1
on 1
her 1
dress 1
Then 1
he 1
carried 1
the 1
child 1
away 1
to 1
a 1
secret 1
place 1
where 1
a 1
nurse 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
suckle 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
accused 1
the 1
queen 1
of 1
having 1
allowed 1
her 1
child 1
to 1
be 1
taken 1
from 1
her 1
by 1
the 1
wild 1
beasts 1
When 1
the 1
king 1
saw 1
the 1
blood 1
on 1
her 1
apron 1
he 1
believed 1
this 1
fell 1
into 1
such 1
a 1
passion 1
that 1
he 1
ordered 1
a 1
high 1
tower 1
to 1
be 1
built 1
in 1
which 1
neither 1
sun 1
nor 1
moon 1
could 1
be 1
seen 1
and 1
had 1
his 1
wife 1
put 1
into 1
it 1
and 1
walled 1
up 1
Here 1
she 1
was 1
to 1
stay 1
for 1
seven 1
years 1
without 1
meat 1
or 1
drink 1
and 1
die 1
of 1
hunger 1
But 1
God 1
sent 1
two 1
angels 1
from 1
heaven 1
in 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
white 1
doves 1
which 1
flew 1
to 1
her 1
twice 1
a 1
day 1
and 1
carried 1
her 1
food 1
until 1
the 1
seven 1
years 1
were 1
over 1
The 1
cook 1
however 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
If 1
the 1
child 1
has 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
wishing 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
here 1
he 1
might 1
very 1
easily 1
get 1
me 1
into 1
trouble 1
So 1
he 1
left 1
the 1
palace 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
boy 1
who 1
was 1
already 1
big 1
enough 1
to 1
speak 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
Wish 1
for 1
a 1
beautiful 1
palace 1
for 1
yourself 1
with 1
a 1
garden 1
and 1
all 1
else 1
that 1
pertains 1
to 1
it 1
Scarcely 1
were 1
the 1
words 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
boy 1
s 1
mouth 1
when 1
everything 1
was 1
there 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
wished 1
for 1
After 1
a 1
while 1
the 1
cook 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
well 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
alone 1
wish 1
for 1
a 1
pretty 1
girl 1
as 1
a 1
companion 1
Then 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
wished 1
for 1
one 1
and 1
she 1
immediately 1
stood 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
was 1
more 1
beautiful 1
than 1
any 1
painter 1
could 1
have 1
painted 1
her 1
The 1
two 1
played 1
together 1
and 1
loved 1
each 1
other 1
with 1
all 1
their 1
hearts 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
cook 1
went 1
out 1
hunting 1
like 1
a 1
nobleman 1
The 1
thought 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
however 1
that 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
might 1
some 1
day 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
with 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
thus 1
bring 1
him 1
into 1
great 1
peril 1
So 1
he 1
went 1
out 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
maiden 1
aside 1
and 1
said 1
Tonight 1
when 1
the 1
boy 1
is 1
asleep 1
go 1
to 1
his 1
bed 1
and 1
plunge 1
this 1
knife 1
into 1
his 1
heart 1
and 1
bring 1
me 1
his 1
heart 1
and 1
tongue 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
you 1
shall 1
lose 1
your 1
life 1
Thereupon 1
he 1
went 1
away 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
returned 1
next 1
day 1
she 1
had 1
not 1
done 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
Why 1
should 1
I 1
shed 1
the 1
blood 1
of 1
an 1
innocent 1
boy 1
who 1
has 1
never 1
harmed 1
anyone 1
The 1
cook 1
once 1
more 1
said 1
If 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
do 1
it 2
shall 1
cost 1
you 1
your 1
own 1
life 1
When 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
away 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
little 1
hind 1
brought 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
ordered 1
her 1
to 1
be 1
killed 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
heart 1
and 1
tongue 1
and 1
laid 1
them 1
on 1
a 1
plate 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
coming 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
boy 1
Lie 1
down 1
in 1
your 1
bed 1
and 1
draw 1
the 1
clothes 1
over 1
you 1
Then 1
the 1
wicked 1
wretch 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
said 1
Where 1
are 1
the 1
boy 1
s 1
heart 1
and 1
tongue 1
The 1
girl 1
reached 1
the 1
plate 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
threw 1
off 1
the 1
quilt 1
and 1
said 1
You 1
old 1
sinner 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
kill 1
me 1
Now 1
will 1
I 1
pronounce 1
thy 1
sentence 1
You 1
shall 1
become 1
a 1
black 1
poodle 1
and 1
have 1
a 1
gold 1
collar 1
round 1
your 1
neck 1
and 1
shall 1
eat 1
burning 1
coals 1
till 1
the 1
flames 1
burst 1
forth 1
from 1
your 1
throat 1
And 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
spoken 1
these 1
words 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
was 1
changed 1
into 1
a 1
poodle 1
dog 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
gold 1
collar 1
round 1
his 1
neck 1
and 1
the 1
cooks 1
were 1
ordered 1
to 1
bring 1
up 1
some 1
live 1
coals 1
and 1
these 1
he 1
ate 1
until 1
the 1
flames 1
broke 1
forth 1
from 1
his 1
throat 1
The 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
remained 1
there 1
a 1
short 1
while 1
longer 1
and 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
his 1
mother 1
and 1
wondered 1
if 1
she 1
were 1
still 1
alive 1
At 1
length 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
maiden 1
I 1
will 1
go 1
home 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
country 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
go 1
with 1
me 1
I 1
will 1
provide 1
for 1
you 1
Ah 1
she 1
replied 1
the 1
way 1
is 1
so 1
long 1
and 1
what 1
shall 1
I 1
do 1
in 1
a 1
strange 1
land 1
where 1
I 1
am 1
unknown 1
As 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
seem 1
quite 1
willing 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
parted 1
from 1
each 1
other 1
he 1
wished 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
be 1
changed 1
into 1
a 1
beautiful 1
pink 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
with 1
him 1
Then 1
he 1
went 1
away 1
to 1
his 1
own 1
country 1
and 1
the 1
poodle 1
had 1
to 1
run 1
after 1
him 1
He 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
tower 1
in 1
which 1
his 1
mother 1
was 1
confined 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
high 1
he 1
wished 1
for 1
a 1
ladder 1
which 1
would 1
reach 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
very 1
top 1
Then 1
he 1
mounted 1
up 1
and 1
looked 1
inside 1
and 1
cried 1
Beloved 1
mother 1
Lady 1
Queen 1
are 1
you 1
still 1
alive 1
or 1
are 1
you 1
dead 1
She 1
answered 1
I 1
have 1
just 1
eaten 1
and 1
am 1
still 1
satisfied 1
for 1
she 1
thought 1
the 1
angels 1
were 1
there 1
Said 1
he 1
I 1
am 1
your 1
dear 1
son 1
whom 1
the 1
wild 1
beasts 1
were 1
said 1
to 1
have 1
torn 1
from 1
your 1
arms 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
alive 1
still 1
and 1
will 1
soon 1
set 1
you 1
free 1
Then 1
he 1
descended 1
again 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
caused 1
himself 1
to 1
be 1
announced 1
as 1
a 1
strange 1
huntsman 1
and 1
asked 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
offer 1
him 1
service 1
The 1
king 1
said 1
yes 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
skilful 1
and 1
could 1
get 1
game 1
for 1
him 1
he 1
should 1
come 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
that 1
deer 1
had 1
never 1
taken 1
up 1
their 1
quarters 1
in 1
any 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
district 1
or 1
country 1
Then 1
the 1
huntsman 1
promised 1
to 1
procure 1
as 1
much 1
game 1
for 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
possibly 1
use 1
at 1
the 1
royal 1
table 1
So 1
he 1
summoned 1
all 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
together 1
and 1
bade 1
them 1
go 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
with 1
him 1
And 1
he 1
went 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
made 1
them 1
form 1
a 1
great 1
circle 1
open 1
at 1
one 1
end 1
where 1
he 1
stationed 1
himself 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
wish 1
Two 1
hundred 1
deer 1
and 1
more 1
came 1
running 1
inside 1
the 1
circle 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
shot 1
them 1
Then 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
placed 1
on 1
sixty 1
country 1
carts 1
and 1
driven 1
home 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
for 1
once 1
he 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
deck 1
his 1
table 1
with 1
game 1
after 1
having 1
had 1
none 1
at 1
all 1
for 1
years 1
Now 1
the 1
king 1
felt 1
great 1
joy 1
at 1
this 1
and 1
commanded 1
that 1
his 1
entire 1
household 1
should 1
eat 1
with 1
him 1
next 1
day 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
great 1
feast 1
When 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
assembled 1
together 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
huntsman 1
As 1
you 1
are 1
so 1
clever 1
you 1
shall 1
sit 1
by 1
me 1
He 1
replied 1
Lord 1
King 1
your 1
majesty 1
must 1
excuse 1
me 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
poor 1
huntsman 1
But 1
the 1
king 1
insisted 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
You 1
shall 1
sit 1
by 1
me 1
until 1
he 1
did 1
it 1
Whilst 1
he 1
was 1
sitting 1
there 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
his 1
dearest 1
mother 1
and 1
wished 1
that 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
principal 1
servants 1
would 1
begin 1
to 1
speak 1
of 1
her 1
and 1
would 1
ask 1
how 1
it 1
was 1
faring 1
with 1
the 1
queen 1
in 1
the 1
tower 1
and 1
if 1
she 1
were 1
alive 1
still 1
or 1
had 1
perished 1
Hardly 1
had 1
he 1
formed 1
the 1
wish 1
than 1
the 1
marshal 1
began 1
and 1
said 1
Your 1
majesty 1
we 1
live 1
joyously 1
here 1
but 1
how 1
is 1
the 1
queen 1
living 1
in 1
the 1
tower 1
Is 1
she 1
still 1
alive 1
or 1
has 1
she 1
died 1
But 1
the 1
king 1
replied 1
She 1
let 1
my 1
dear 1
son 1
be 1
torn 1
to 1
pieces 1
by 1
wild 1
beasts 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
have 1
her 1
named 1
Then 1
the 1
huntsman 1
arose 1
and 1
said 1
Gracious 1
lord 1
father 1
she 1
is 1
alive 1
still 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
her 1
son 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
carried 1
away 1
by 1
wild 1
beasts 1
but 1
by 1
that 1
wretch 1
the 1
old 1
cook 1
who 1
tore 1
me 1
from 1
her 1
arms 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
asleep 1
and 1
sprinkled 1
her 1
apron 1
with 1
the 1
blood 1
of 1
a 1
chicken 1
Thereupon 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
dog 1
with 1
the 1
golden 1
collar 1
and 1
said 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
wretch 1
and 1
caused 1
live 1
coals 1
to 1
be 1
brought 1
and 1
these 1
the 1
dog 1
was 1
compelled 1
to 1
devour 1
before 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
all 1
until 1
flames 1
burst 1
forth 1
from 1
its 1
throat 1
On 1
this 1
the 1
huntsman 1
asked 1
the 1
king 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
dog 1
in 1
his 1
true 1
shape 1
and 1
wished 1
him 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
form 1
of 1
the 1
cook 1
in 1
the 1
which 1
he 1
stood 1
immediately 1
with 1
his 1
white 1
apron 1
and 1
his 1
knife 1
by 1
his 1
side 1
When 1
the 1
king 1
saw 1
him 1
he 1
fell 1
into 1
a 1
passion 1
and 1
ordered 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
cast 1
into 1
the 1
deepest 1
dungeon 1
Then 1
the 1
huntsman 1
spoke 1
further 1
and 1
said 1
Father 1
will 1
you 1
see 1
the 1
maiden 1
who 1
brought 1
me 1
up 1
so 1
tenderly 1
and 1
who 1
was 1
afterwards 1
to 1
murder 1
me 1
but 1
did 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
though 1
her 1
own 1
life 1
depended 1
on 1
it 1
The 1
king 1
replied 1
Yes 1
I 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
The 1
son 1
said 1
Most 1
gracious 1
father 1
I 1
will 1
show 1
her 1
to 1
you 1
in 1
the 1
form 1
of 1
a 1
beautiful 1
flower 1
and 1
he 1
thrust 1
his 1
hand 1
into 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
brought 1
forth 1
the 1
pink 1
and 1
placed 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
royal 1
table 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
beautiful 1
that 1
the 1
king 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
one 1
to 1
equal 1
it 1
Then 1
the 1
son 1
said 1
Now 1
will 1
I 1
show 1
her 1
to 1
you 1
in 1
her 1
own 1
form 1
and 1
wished 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
become 1
a 1
maiden 1
and 1
she 1
stood 1
there 1
looking 1
so 1
beautiful 1
that 1
no 1
painter 1
could 1
have 1
made 1
her 1
look 1
more 1
so 1
And 1
the 1
king 1
sent 1
two 1
waiting 1
maids 1
and 1
two 1
attendants 1
into 1
the 1
tower 1
to 1
fetch 1
the 1
queen 1
and 1
bring 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
royal 1
table 1
But 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
led 1
in 1
she 1
ate 1
nothing 1
and 1
said 1
The 1
gracious 1
and 1
merciful 1
God 1
who 1
has 1
supported 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
tower 1
will 1
soon 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
She 1
lived 1
three 1
days 1
more 1
and 1
then 1
died 1
happily 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
buried 1
the 1
two 1
white 1
doves 1
which 1
had 1
brought 1
her 1
food 1
to 1
the 1
tower 1
and 1
were 1
angels 1
of 1
heaven 1
followed 1
her 1
body 1
and 1
seated 1
themselves 1
on 1
her 1
grave 1
The 1
aged 1
king 1
ordered 1
the 1
cook 1
to 1
be 1
torn 1
in 1
four 1
pieces 1
but 1
grief 1
consumed 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
own 1
heart 1
and 1
he 1
soon 1
died 1
His 1
son 1
married 1
the 1
beautiful 1
maiden 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
brought 1
with 1
him 1
as 1
a 1
flower 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
whether 1
they 1
are 1
still 1
alive 1
or 1
not 1
is 1
known 1
to 1
God 1
CLEVER 1
ELSIE 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
a 1
daughter 1
who 1
was 1
called 1
Clever 1
Elsie 1
And 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
grown 1
up 1
her 1
father 1
said 1
We 1
will 1
get 1
her 1
married 1
Yes 1
said 1
the 1
mother 1
if 1
only 1
someone 1
would 1
come 1
who 1
would 1
have 1
her 1
At 1
length 1
a 1
man 1
came 1
from 1
a 1
distance 1
and 1
wooed 1
her 1
who 1
was 1
called 1
Hans 1
but 1
he 1
stipulated 1
that 1
Clever 1
Elsie 1
should 1
be 1
really 1
smart 1
Oh 1
said 1
the 1
father 1
she 1
has 1
plenty 1
of 1
good 1
sense 1
and 1
the 1
mother 1
said 1
Oh 1
she 1
can 1
see 1
the 1
wind 1
coming 1
up 1
the 1
street 1
and 1
hear 1
the 1
flies 1
coughing 1
Well 1
said 1
Hans 1
if 1
she 1
is 1
not 1
really 1
smart 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
have 1
her 1
When 1
they 1
were 1
sitting 1
at 1
dinner 1
and 1
had 1
eaten 1
the 1
mother 1
said 1
Elsie 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
and 1
fetch 1
some 1
beer 1
Then 1
Clever 1
Elsie 1
took 1
the 1
pitcher 1
from 1
the 1
wall 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
and 1
tapped 1
the 1
lid 1
briskly 1
as 1
she 1
went 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
time 1
might 1
not 1
appear 1
long 1
When 1
she 1
was 1
below 1
she 1
fetched 1
herself 1
a 1
chair 1
and 1
set 1
it 1
before 1
the 1
barrel 1
so 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
need 1
to 1
stoop 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
hurt 1
her 1
back 1
or 1
do 1
herself 1
any 1
unexpected 1
injury 1
Then 1
she 1
placed 1
the 1
can 1
before 1
her 1
and 1
turned 1
the 1
tap 1
and 1
while 1
the 1
beer 1
was 1
running 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
let 1
her 1
eyes 1
be 1
idle 1
but 1
looked 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
after 1
much 1
peering 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
saw 1
a 1
pick 1
axe 1
exactly 1
above 1
her 1
which 1
the 1
masons 1
had 1
accidentally 1
left 1
there 1
Then 1
Clever 1
Elsie 1
began 1
to 1
weep 1
and 1
said 1
If 1
I 1
get 1
Hans 1
and 1
we 1
have 1
a 1
child 1
and 1
he 1
grows 1
big 1
and 1
we 1
send 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
here 1
to 1
draw 1
beer 1
then 1
the 1
pick 1
axe 1
will 1
fall 1
on 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
kill 1
him 1
Then 1
she 1
sat 1
and 1
wept 1
and 1
screamed 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
strength 1
of 1
her 1
body 1
over 1
the 1
misfortune 1
which 1
lay 1
before 1
her 1
Those 1
upstairs 1
waited 1
for 1
the 1
drink 1
but 1
Clever 1
Elsie 1
still 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
Then 1
the 1
woman 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
servant 1
Just 1
go 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
and 1
see 1
where 1
Elsie 1
is 1
The 1
maid 1
went 1
and 1
found 1
her 1
sitting 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
barrel 1
screaming 1
loudly 1
Elsie 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
weep 1
asked 1
the 1
maid 1
Ah 1
she 1
answered 1
have 1
I 1
not 1
reason 1
to 1
weep 1
If 1
I 1
get 1
Hans 1
and 1
we 1
have 1
a 1
child 1
and 1
he 1
grows 1
big 1
and 1
has 1
to 1
draw 1
beer 1
here 1
the 1
pick 1
axe 1
will 1
perhaps 1
fall 1
on 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
kill 1
him 1
Then 1
said 1
the 1
maid 1
What 1
a 1
clever 1
Elsie 1
we 1
have 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
beside 1
her 1
and 1
began 1
loudly 1
to 1
weep 1
over 1
the 1
misfortune 1
After 1
a 1
while 1
as 1
the 1
maid 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
those 1
upstairs 1
were 1
thirsty 1
for 1
the 1
beer 1
the 1
man 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
boy 1
Just 1
go 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
and 1
see 1
where 1
Elsie 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
are 1
The 1
boy 1
went 1
down 1
and 1
there 1
sat 1
Clever 1
Elsie 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
both 1
weeping 1
together 1
Then 1
he 1
asked 1
Why 1
are 1
you 1
weeping 1
Ah 1
said 1
Elsie 1
have 1
I 1
not 1
reason 1
to 1
weep 1
If 1
I 1
get 1
Hans 1
and 1
we 1
have 1
a 1
child 1
and 1
he 1
grows 1
big 1
and 1
has 1
to 1
draw 1
beer 1
here 1
the 1
pick 1
axe 1
will 1
fall 1
on 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
kill 1
him 1
Then 1
said 1
the 1
boy 1
What 1
a 1
clever 1
Elsie 1
we 1
have 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
by 1
her 1
and 1
likewise 1
began 1
to 1
howl 1
loudly 1
Upstairs 1
they 1
waited 1
for 1
the 1
boy 1
but 1
as 1
he 1
still 1
did 1
not 1
return 1
the 1
man 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
woman 1
Just 1
go 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
and 1
see 1
where 1
Elsie 1
is 1
The 1
woman 1
went 1
down 1
and 1
found 1
all 1
three 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
their 1
lamentations 1
and 1
inquired 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
cause 1
then 1
Elsie 1
told 1
her 1
also 1
that 1
her 1
future 1
child 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
killed 1
by 1
the 1
pick 1
axe 1
when 1
it 1
grew 1
big 1
and 1
had 1
to 1
draw 1
beer 1
and 1
the 1
pick 1
axe 1
fell 1
down 1
Then 1
said 1
the 1
mother 1
likewise 1
What 1
a 1
clever 1
Elsie 1
we 1
have 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
wept 1
with 1
them 1
The 1
man 1
upstairs 1
waited 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
but 1
as 1
his 1
wife 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
his 1
thirst 1
grew 1
ever 1
greater 1
he 1
said 1
I 1
must 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
myself 1
and 1
see 1
where 1
Elsie 1
is 1
But 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
sitting 1
together 1
crying 1
and 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
reason 1
and 1
that 1
Elsie 1
s 1
child 1
was 1
the 1
cause 1
and 1
the 1
Elsie 1
might 1
perhaps 1
bring 1
one 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
some 1
day 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
killed 1
by 1
the 1
pick 1
axe 1
if 1
he 1
should 1
happen 1
to 1
be 1
sitting 1
beneath 1
it 1
drawing 1
beer 1
just 1
at 1
the 1
very 1
time 1
when 1
it 1
fell 1
down 1
he 1
cried 1
Oh 1
what 1
a 1
clever 1
Elsie 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
likewise 1
wept 1
with 1
them 1
The 1
bridegroom 1
stayed 1
upstairs 1
alone 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
then 1
as 1
no 1
one 1
would 1
come 1
back 1
he 1
thought 1
They 1
must 1
be 1
waiting 1
for 1
me 1
below 1
I 1
too 1
must 1
go 1
there 1
and 1
see 1
what 1
they 1
are 1
about 1
When 1
he 1
got 1
down 1
the 1
five 1
of 1
them 1
were 1
sitting 1
screaming 1
and 1
lamenting 1
quite 1
piteously 1
each 1
out 1
doing 1
the 1
other 1
What 1
misfortune 1
has 1
happened 1
then 1
asked 1
he 1
Ah 1
dear 1
Hans 1
said 1
Elsie 1
if 1
we 1
marry 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
have 1
a 1
child 1
and 1
he 1
is 1
big 1
and 1
we 1
perhaps 1
send 1
him 1
here 1
to 1
draw 1
something 1
to 1
drink 1
then 1
the 1
pick 1
axe 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
left 1
up 1
there 1
might 1
dash 1
his 1
brains 1
out 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
to 1
fall 1
down 1
so 1
have 1
we 1
not 1
reason 1
to 1
weep 1
Come 1
said 1
Hans 1
more 1
understanding 1
than 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
needed 1
for 1
my 1
household 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
such 1
a 1
clever 1
Elsie 1
I 1
will 1
have 1
you 1
and 1
seized 1
her 1
hand 1
took 1
her 1
upstairs 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
married 1
her 1
After 1
Hans 1
had 2
her 1
some 1
time 1
he 1
said 1
Wife 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
out 1
to 1
work 1
and 1
earn 1
some 1
money 1
for 1
us 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
field 1
and 1
cut 1
the 1
corn 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
have 1
some 1
bread 1
Yes 1
dear 1
Hans 1
I 1
will 1
do 1
that 1
After 1
Hans 1
had 1
gone 1
away 1
she 1
cooked 1
herself 1
some 1
good 1
broth 1
and 1
took 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
field 1
with 1
her 1
When 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
field 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
herself 1
What 1
shall 1
I 1
do 1
shall 1
I 1
cut 1
first 1
or 1
shall 1
I 1
eat 1
first 1
Oh 1
I 1
will 1
eat 1
first 1
Then 1
she 1
drank 1
her 1
cup 1
of 1
broth 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
fully 1
satisfied 1
she 1
once 1
more 1
said 1
What 1
shall 1
I 1
do 1
Shall 1
I 1
cut 1
first 1
or 1
shall 1
I 1
sleep 1
first 1
I 1
will 1
sleep 1
first 1
Then 1
she 1
lay 1
down 1
among 1
the 1
corn 1
and 1
fell 1
asleep 1
Hans 1
had 1
been 1
at 1
home 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
but 1
Elsie 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
then 1
said 1
he 1
What 1
a 1
clever 1
Elsie 1
I 1
have 1
she 1
is 1
so 1
industrious 1
that 1
she 1
does 1
not 1
even 1
come 1
home 1
to 1
eat 1
But 1
when 1
evening 1
came 1
and 1
she 1
still 1
stayed 1
away 1
Hans 1
went 1
out 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
cut 1
but 1
nothing 1
was 1
cut 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
lying 1
among 1
the 1
corn 1
asleep 1
Then 1
Hans 1
hastened 1
home 1
and 1
brought 1
a 1
fowler 1
s 1
net 1
with 1
little 1
bells 1
and 1
hung 1
it 1
round 1
about 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
still 1
went 1
on 1
sleeping 1
Then 1
he 1
ran 1
home 1
shut 1
the 1
house 1
door 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
worked 1
At 1
length 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
dark 1
Clever 1
Elsie 1
awoke 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
got 1
up 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
jingling 1
all 1
round 1
about 1
her 1
and 1
the 1
bells 1
rang 1
at 1
each 1
step 1
which 1
she 1
took 1
Then 1
she 1
was 1
alarmed 1
and 1
became 1
uncertain 1
whether 1
she 1
really 1
was 1
Clever 1
Elsie 1
or 1
not 1
and 1
said 1
Is 1
it 1
I 1
or 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
I 1
But 1
she 1
knew 1
not 1
what 1
answer 1
to 1
make 1
to 1
this 1
and 1
stood 1
for 1
a 1
time 1
in 1
doubt 1
at 1
length 1
she 1
thought 1
I 1
will 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
ask 1
if 1
it 1
be 1
I 1
or 1
if 1
it 1
be 1
not 1
I 1
they 1
will 1
be 1
sure 1
to 1
know 1
She 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
house 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
shut 1
then 1
she 1
knocked 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
cried 1
Hans 1
is 1
Elsie 1
within 1
Yes 1
answered 1
Hans 1
she 1
is 1
within 1
Hereupon 1
she 1
was 1
terrified 1
and 1
said 1
Ah 1
heavens 1
Then 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
I 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
another 1
door 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
people 1
heard 1
the 1
jingling 1
of 1
the 1
bells 1
they 1
would 1
not 1
open 1
it 1
and 1
she 1
could 1
get 1
in 1
nowhere 1
Then 1
she 1
ran 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
has 1
seen 1
her 1
since 1
THE 1
MISER 1
IN 1
THE 1
BUSH 1
A 1
farmer 1
had 1
a 1
faithful 1
and 1
diligent 1
servant 1
who 1
had 1
worked 1
hard 1
for 1
him 1
three 1
years 1
without 1
having 1
been 1
paid 1
any 1
wages 1
At 1
last 1
it 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
head 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
go 1
on 1
thus 1
without 1
pay 1
any 1
longer 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
his 1
master 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
have 1
worked 1
hard 1
for 1
you 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
I 1
will 1
trust 1
to 1
you 1
to 1
give 1
me 1
what 1
I 1
deserve 1
to 1
have 1
for 1
my 1
trouble 1
The 1
farmer 1
was 1
a 1
sad 1
miser 1
and 1
knew 1
that 1
his 1
man 1
was 1
very 1
simple 1
hearted 1
so 1
he 1
took 1
out 1
threepence 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
for 1
every 1
year 1
s 1
service 1
a 1
penny 1
The 1
poor 1
fellow 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
money 1
to 1
have 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
Why 1
should 1
I 1
work 1
hard 1
and 1
live 1
here 1
on 1
bad 1
fare 1
any 1
longer 1
I 1
can 1
now 1
travel 1
into 1
the 1
wide 1
world 1
and 1
make 1
myself 1
merry 1
With 1
that 1
he 1
put 1
his 1
money 1
into 1
his 1
purse 1
and 1
set 1
out 1
roaming 1
over 1
hill 1
and 1
valley 1
As 1
he 1
jogged 1
along 1
over 1
the 1
fields 1
singing 1
and 1
dancing 1
a 1
little 1
dwarf 1
met 1
him 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
what 1
made 1
him 1
so 1
merry 1
Why 1
what 1
should 1
make 1
me 1
down 1
hearted 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
am 1
sound 1
in 1
health 1
and 1
rich 1
in 1
purse 1
what 1
should 1
I 1
care 1
for 1
I 1
have 1
saved 1
up 1
my 1
three 1
years 1
earnings 1
and 1
have 1
it 1
all 1
safe 1
in 1
my 1
pocket 1
How 1
much 1
may 1
it 1
come 1
to 1
said 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
Full 1
threepence 1
replied 1
the 1
countryman 1
I 1
wish 1
you 1
would 1
give 1
them 1
to 1
me 1
said 1
the 1
other 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
poor 1
Then 1
the 1
man 1
pitied 1
him 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
all 1
he 1
had 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
dwarf 1
said 1
in 1
return 1
As 1
you 1
have 1
such 1
a 1
kind 1
honest 1
heart 1
I 1
will 1
grant 1
you 1
three 1
wishes 1
one 1
for 1
every 1
penny 1
so 1
choose 1
whatever 1
you 1
like 1
Then 1
the 1
countryman 1
rejoiced 1
at 1
his 1
good 1
luck 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
like 1
many 1
things 1
better 1
than 1
money 1
first 1
I 1
will 1
have 1
a 1
bow 1
that 1
will 1
bring 1
down 1
everything 1
I 1
shoot 1
at 1
secondly 1
a 1
fiddle 1
that 1
will 1
set 1
everyone 1
dancing 1
that 1
hears 1
me 1
play 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
thirdly 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
that 1
everyone 1
should 1
grant 1
what 1
I 1
ask 1
The 1
dwarf 1
said 1
he 1
should 1
have 1
his 1
three 1
wishes 1
so 1
he 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
bow 1
and 1
fiddle 1
and 1
went 1
his 1
way 1
Our 1
honest 1
friend 1
journeyed 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
too 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
merry 1
before 1
he 1
was 1
now 1
ten 1
times 1
more 1
so 1
He 1
had 1
not 1
gone 1
far 1
before 1
he 1
met 1
an 1
old 1
miser 1
close 1
by 1
them 1
stood 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
topmost 1
twig 1
sat 1
a 1
thrush 1
singing 1
away 1
most 1
joyfully 1
Oh 1
what 1
a 1
pretty 1
bird 1
said 1
the 1
miser 1
I 1
would 1
give 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
money 1
to 1
have 1
such 1
a 1
one 1
If 1
that 1
s 1
all 1
said 1
the 1
countryman 1
I 1
will 1
soon 1
bring 1
it 1
down 1
Then 1
he 1
took 1
up 1
his 1
bow 1
and 1
down 1
fell 1
the 1
thrush 1
into 1
the 1
bushes 1
at 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
The 1
miser 1
crept 1
into 1
the 1
bush 1
to 1
find 1
it 1
but 1
directly 1
he 1
had 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
middle 1
his 1
companion 1
took 1
up 1
his 1
fiddle 1
and 1
played 1
away 1
and 1
the 1
miser 1
began 1
to 1
dance 1
and 1
spring 1
about 1
capering 1
higher 1
and 1
higher 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
The 1
thorns 1
soon 1
began 1
to 1
tear 1
his 1
clothes 1
till 1
they 1
all 1
hung 1
in 1
rags 1
about 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
himself 1
was 1
all 1
scratched 1
and 1
wounded 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
blood 1
ran 1
down 1
Oh 1
for 1
heaven 1
s 1
sake 1
cried 1
the 1
miser 1
Master 1
master 1
pray 1
let 1
the 1
fiddle 1
alone 1
What 1
have 1
I 1
done 1
to 1
deserve 1
this 1
Thou 1
hast 1
shaved 1
many 1
a 1
poor 1
soul 1
close 1
enough 1
said 1
the 1
other 1
thou 1
art 1
only 1
meeting 1
thy 1
reward 1
so 1
he 1
played 1
up 1
another 1
tune 1
Then 1
the 1
miser 1
began 1
to 1
beg 1
and 1
promise 1
and 1
offered 1
money 1
for 1
his 1
liberty 1
but 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
musician 1
s 1
price 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
and 1
he 1
danced 1
him 1
along 1
brisker 1
and 1
brisker 1
and 1
the 1
miser 1
bid 1
higher 1
and 1
higher 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
offered 1
a 1
round 1
hundred 1
of 1
florins 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
in 1
his 1
purse 1
and 1
had 1
just 1
gained 1
by 1
cheating 1
some 1
poor 1
fellow 1
When 1
the 1
countryman 1
saw 1
so 1
much 1
money 1
he 1
said 1
I 1
will 1
agree 1
to 1
your 1
proposal 1
So 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
purse 1
put 1
up 1
his 1
fiddle 1
and 1
travelled 1
on 1
very 1
pleased 1
with 1
his 1
bargain 1
Meanwhile 1
the 1
miser 1
crept 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bush 1
half 1
naked 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
piteous 1
plight 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
ponder 1
how 1
he 1
should 1
take 1
his 1
revenge 1
and 1
serve 1
his 1
late 1
companion 1
some 1
trick 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
judge 1
and 1
complained 1
that 1
a 1
rascal 1
had 1
robbed 1
him 1
of 1
his 1
money 1
and 1
beaten 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
bargain 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
fellow 1
who 1
did 1
it 1
carried 1
a 1
bow 1
at 1
his 1
back 1
and 1
a 1
fiddle 1
hung 1
round 1
his 1
neck 1
Then 1
the 1
judge 1
sent 1
out 1
his 1
officers 1
to 1
bring 1
up 1
the 1
accused 1
wherever 1
they 1
should 1
find 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
soon 1
caught 1
and 1
brought 1
up 1
to 1
be 1
tried 1
The 1
miser 1
began 1
to 1
tell 1
his 1
tale 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
robbed 1
of 1
his 1
money 1
No 1
you 1
gave 1
it 1
me 1
for 1
playing 1
a 1
tune 1
to 1
you 1
said 1
the 1
countryman 1
but 1
the 1
judge 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
was 1
not 1
likely 1
and 1
cut 1
the 1
matter 1
short 1
by 1
ordering 1
him 1
off 1
to 1
the 1
gallows 1
So 1
away 1
he 1
was 1
taken 1
but 1
as 1
he 1
stood 1
on 1
the 1
steps 1
he 1
said 1
My 1
Lord 1
Judge 1
grant 1
me 1
one 1
last 1
request 1
Anything 1
but 1
thy 1
life 1
replied 1
the 1
other 1
No 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
ask 1
my 1
life 1
only 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
play 1
upon 1
my 1
fiddle 1
for 1
the 1
last 1
time 1
The 1
miser 1
cried 1
out 1
Oh 1
no 2
for 1
heaven 1
s 1
sake 1
don 1
t 1
listen 1
to 1
him 1
don 1
t 1
listen 1
to 1
him 1
But 1
the 1
judge 1
said 1
It 1
is 1
only 1
this 1
once 1
he 1
will 1
soon 1
have 1
done 1
The 1
fact 1
was 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
refuse 1
the 1
request 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
dwarf 1
s 1
third 1
gift 1
Then 1
the 1
miser 1
said 1
Bind 1
me 1
fast 1
bind 1
me 1
fast 1
for 1
pity 1
s 1
sake 1
But 1
the 1
countryman 1
seized 1
his 1
fiddle 1
and 1
struck 1
up 1
a 1
tune 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
first 1
note 1
judge 1
clerks 1
and 1
jailer 1
were 1
in 1
motion 1
all 1
began 1
capering 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
could 1
hold 1
the 1
miser 1
At 1
the 1
second 1
note 1
the 1
hangman 1
let 1
his 1
prisoner 1
go 1
and 1
danced 1
also 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
he 1
had 1
played 1
the 1
first 1
bar 1
of 1
the 1
tune 1
all 1
were 1
dancing 1
together 1
judge 1
court 1
and 1
miser 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
people 1
who 1
had 1
followed 1
to 1
look 1
on 1
At 1
first 1
the 1
thing 1
was 1
merry 1
and 1
pleasant 1
enough 1
but 1
when 1
it 1
had 1
gone 1
on 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
there 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
no 1
end 1
of 1
playing 1
or 1
dancing 1
they 1
began 1
to 1
cry 1
out 1
and 1
beg 1
him 1
to 1
leave 1
off 1
but 1
he 1
stopped 1
not 1
a 1
whit 1
the 1
more 1
for 1
their 1
entreaties 1
till 1
the 1
judge 1
not 1
only 1
gave 1
him 1
his 1
life 1
but 1
promised 1
to 1
return 1
him 1
the 1
hundred 1
florins 1
Then 1
he 1
called 1
to 1
the 1
miser 1
and 1
said 1
Tell 1
us 1
now 1
you 1
vagabond 1
where 1
you 1
got 1
that 1
gold 1
or 1
I 1
shall 1
play 1
on 1
for 1
your 1
amusement 1
only 1
I 1
stole 1
it 1
said 1
the 1
miser 1
in 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
people 1
I 1
acknowledge 1
that 1
I 1
stole 1
it 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
earned 1
it 1
fairly 1
Then 1
the 1
countryman 1
stopped 1
his 1
fiddle 1
and 1
left 1
the 1
miser 1
to 1
take 1
his 1
place 1
at 1
the 1
gallows 1
ASHPUTTEL 1
The 1
wife 1
of 1
a 1
rich 1
man 1
fell 1
sick 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
felt 1
that 1
her 1
end 1
drew 1
nigh 1
she 1
called 1
her 1
only 1
daughter 1
to 1
her 1
bed 1
side 1
and 1
said 1
Always 1
be 1
a 1
good 1
girl 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
look 1
down 1
from 1
heaven 1
and 1
watch 1
over 1
you 1
Soon 1
afterwards 1
she 1
shut 1
her 1
eyes 1
and 1
died 1
and 1
was 1
buried 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
girl 1
went 1
every 1
day 1
to 1
her 1
grave 1
and 1
wept 1
and 1
was 1
always 1
good 1
and 1
kind 1
to 1
all 1
about 1
her 1
And 1
the 1
snow 1
fell 1
and 1
spread 1
a 1
beautiful 1
white 1
covering 1
over 1
the 1
grave 1
but 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
the 1
spring 1
came 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
had 1
melted 1
it 1
away 1
again 1
her 1
father 1
had 1
married 1
another 1
wife 1
This 1
new 1
wife 1
had 1
two 1
daughters 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
that 1
she 1
brought 1
home 1
with 1
her 1
they 1
were 1
fair 1
in 1
face 1
but 1
foul 1
at 1
heart 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
now 1
a 1
sorry 1
time 1
for 1
the 1
poor 1
little 1
girl 1
What 1
does 1
the 1
good 1
for 1
nothing 1
want 1
in 1
the 1
parlour 1
said 1
they 2
who 1
would 1
eat 1
bread 1
should 1
first 1
earn 1
it 1
away 1
with 1
the 1
kitchen 1
maid 1
Then 1
they 1
took 1
away 1
her 1
fine 1
clothes 1
and 1
gave 1
her 1
an 1
old 1
grey 1
frock 1
to 1
put 1
on 1
and 1
laughed 1
at 1
her 1
and 1
turned 1
her 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
There 1
she 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
do 1
hard 1
work 1
to 1
rise 1
early 1
before 1
daylight 1
to 1
bring 1
the 1
water 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
fire 1
to 1
cook 1
and 1
to 1
wash 1
Besides 1
that 1
the 1
sisters 1
plagued 1
her 1
in 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
ways 1
and 1
laughed 1
at 1
her 1
In 1
the 1
evening 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
tired 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
bed 1
to 1
lie 1
down 1
on 1
but 1
was 1
made 1
to 1
lie 1
by 1
the 1
hearth 1
among 1
the 1
ashes 1
and 1
as 1
this 1
of 1
course 1
made 1
her 1
always 1
dusty 1
and 1
dirty 1
they 1
called 1
her 1
Ashputtel 1
It 1
happened 1
once 1
that 1
the 1
father 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
fair 1
and 1
asked 1
his 1
wife 1
s 1
daughters 1
what 1
he 1
should 1
bring 1
them 1
Fine 1
clothes 1
said 1
the 1
first 1
Pearls 1
and 1
diamonds 1
cried 1
the 1
second 1
Now 1
child 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
his 1
own 1
daughter 1
what 1
will 1
you 1
have 1
The 1
first 1
twig 1
dear 1
father 1
that 1
brushes 1
against 1
your 1
hat 1
when 1
you 1
turn 1
your 1
face 1
to 1
come 1
homewards 1
said 1
she 1
Then 1
he 1
bought 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
two 1
the 1
fine 1
clothes 1
and 1
pearls 1
and 1
diamonds 1
they 1
had 1
asked 1
for 1
and 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
home 1
as 1
he 1
rode 1
through 1
a 1
green 1
copse 1
a 1
hazel 1
twig 1
brushed 1
against 1
him 1
and 1
almost 1
pushed 1
off 1
his 1
hat 1
so 1
he 1
broke 1
it 1
off 1
and 1
brought 1
it 1
away 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
home 1
he 1
gave 1
it 1
to 1
his 1
daughter 1
Then 1
she 1
took 1
it 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
her 1
mother 1
s 1
grave 1
and 1
planted 1
it 1
there 1
and 1
cried 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
watered 1
with 1
her 1
tears 1
and 1
there 1
it 1
grew 1
and 1
became 1
a 1
fine 1
tree 1
Three 1
times 1
every 1
day 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
cried 1
and 1
soon 1
a 1
little 1
bird 1
came 1
and 1
built 1
its 1
nest 1
upon 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
talked 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
watched 1
over 1
her 1
and 1
brought 1
her 1
whatever 1
she 1
wished 1
for 1
Now 1
it 1
happened 1
that 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
that 1
land 1
held 1
a 1
feast 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
last 1
three 1
days 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
came 1
to 1
it 1
his 1
son 1
was 1
to 1
choose 1
a 1
bride 1
for 1
himself 1
Ashputtel 1
s 1
two 1
sisters 1
were 1
asked 1
to 1
come 1
so 1
they 1
called 1
her 1
up 1
and 1
said 1
Now 1
comb 1
our 1
hair 1
brush 1
our 1
shoes 1
and 1
tie 1
our 1
sashes 1
for 1
us 1
for 1
we 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
dance 1
at 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
feast 1
Then 1
she 1
did 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
told 1
but 1
when 1
all 1
was 1
done 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
crying 1
for 1
she 1
thought 1
to 1
herself 1
she 1
should 1
so 1
have 1
liked 1
to 1
have 1
gone 1
with 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
ball 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
she 1
begged 1
her 1
mother 1
very 1
hard 1
to 1
let 1
her 1
go 1
You 1
Ashputtel 1
said 1
she 1
you 1
who 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
wear 1
no 1
clothes 1
at 1
all 1
and 1
who 1
cannot 1
even 1
dance 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
ball 1
And 1
when 1
she 1
kept 1
on 1
begging 1
she 1
said 1
at 1
last 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
her 1
I 1
will 1
throw 1
this 1
dishful 1
of 1
peas 1
into 1
the 1
ash 1
heap 1
and 1
if 1
in 1
two 1
hours 1
time 1
you 1
have 1
picked 1
them 1
all 1
out 1
you 1
shall 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
feast 1
too 1
Then 1
she 1
threw 1
the 1
peas 1
down 1
among 1
the 1
ashes 1
but 1
the 1
little 1
maiden 1
ran 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
door 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
cried 1
out 1
Hither 1
hither 1
through 1
the 1
sky 1
Turtle 1
doves 1
and 1
linnets 1
fly 1
Blackbird 1
thrush 1
and 1
chaffinch 1
gay 1
Hither 1
hither 1
haste 1
away 1
One 1
and 1
all 1
come 1
help 1
me 1
quick 1
Haste 1
ye 1
haste 1
ye 1
pick 3
Then 1
first 1
came 1
two 1
white 1
doves 1
flying 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
kitchen 1
window 1
next 1
came 1
two 1
turtle 1
doves 1
and 1
after 1
them 1
came 1
all 1
the 1
little 1
birds 1
under 1
heaven 1
chirping 1
and 1
fluttering 1
in 1
and 1
they 1
flew 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
ashes 1
And 1
the 1
little 1
doves 1
stooped 1
their 1
heads 1
down 1
and 1
set 1
to 1
work 1
pick 3
and 1
then 1
the 1
others 1
began 1
to 1
pick 3
and 1
among 1
them 1
all 1
they 1
soon 1
picked 1
out 1
all 1
the 1
good 1
grain 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
a 1
dish 1
but 1
left 1
the 1
ashes 1
Long 1
before 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
hour 1
the 1
work 1
was 1
quite 1
done 1
and 1
all 1
flew 1
out 1
again 1
at 1
the 1
windows 1
Then 1
Ashputtel 1
brought 1
the 1
dish 1
to 1
her 1
mother 1
overjoyed 1
at 1
the 1
thought 1
that 1
now 1
she 1
should 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
ball 1
But 1
the 1
mother 1
said 1
No 1
no 1
you 1
slut 1
you 1
have 1
no 1
clothes 1
and 1
cannot 1
dance 1
you 1
shall 1
not 1
go 1
And 1
when 1
Ashputtel 1
begged 1
very 1
hard 1
to 1
go 1
she 1
said 1
If 1
you 1
can 1
in 1
one 1
hour 1
s 1
time 1
pick 1
two 1
of 1
those 1
dishes 1
of 1
peas 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
ashes 1
you 1
shall 1
go 1
too 1
And 1
thus 1
she 1
thought 1
she 1
should 1
at 1
least 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
her 1
So 1
she 1
shook 1
two 1
dishes 1
of 1
peas 1
into 1
the 1
ashes 1
But 1
the 1
little 1
maiden 1
went 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
cried 1
out 1
as 1
before 1
Hither 1
hither 1
through 1
the 1
sky 1
Turtle 1
doves 1
and 1
linnets 1
fly 1
Blackbird 1
thrush 1
and 1
chaffinch 1
gay 1
Hither 1
hither 1
haste 1
away 1
One 1
and 1
all 1
come 1
help 1
me 1
quick 1
Haste 1
ye 1
haste 1
ye 1
pick 3
Then 1
first 1
came 1
two 1
white 1
doves 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
kitchen 1
window 1
next 1
came 1
two 1
turtle 1
doves 1
and 1
after 1
them 1
came 1
all 1
the 1
little 1
birds 1
under 1
heaven 1
chirping 1
and 1
hopping 1
about 1
And 1
they 1
flew 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
ashes 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
doves 1
put 1
their 1
heads 1
down 1
and 1
set 1
to 1
work 1
pick 3
and 1
then 1
the 1
others 1
began 1
pick 3
and 1
they 1
put 1
all 1
the 1
good 1
grain 1
into 1
the 1
dishes 1
and 1
left 1
all 1
the 1
ashes 1
Before 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
s 1
time 1
all 1
was 1
done 1
and 1
out 1
they 1
flew 1
again 1
And 1
then 1
Ashputtel 1
took 1
the 1
dishes 1
to 1
her 1
mother 1
rejoicing 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
she 1
should 1
now 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
ball 1
But 1
her 1
mother 1
said 1
It 1
is 1
all 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
you 1
cannot 1
go 1
you 1
have 1
no 1
clothes 1
and 1
cannot 1
dance 1
and 1
you 1
would 1
only 1
put 1
us 1
to 1
shame 1
and 1
off 1
she 1
went 1
with 1
her 1
two 1
daughters 1
to 1
the 1
ball 1
Now 1
when 1
all 1
were 1
gone 1
and 1
nobody 1
left 1
at 1
home 1
Ashputtel 1
went 1
sorrowfully 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
under 1
the 1
hazel 1
tree 1
and 1
cried 1
out 1
Shake 1
shake 1
hazel 1
tree 1
Gold 1
and 1
silver 1
over 1
me 1
Then 1
her 1
friend 1
the 1
bird 1
flew 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
brought 1
a 1
gold 1
and 1
silver 1
dress 1
for 1
her 1
and 1
slippers 1
of 1
spangled 1
silk 1
and 1
she 1
put 1
them 1
on 1
and 1
followed 1
her 1
sisters 1
to 1
the 1
feast 1
But 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
her 1
and 1
thought 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
some 1
strange 1
princess 1
she 1
looked 1
so 1
fine 1
and 1
beautiful 1
in 1
her 1
rich 1
clothes 1
and 1
they 1
never 1
once 1
thought 1
of 1
Ashputtel 1
taking 1
it 1
for 1
granted 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
safe 1
at 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
dirt 1
The 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
soon 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
danced 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
and 1
he 1
never 1
left 1
her 1
hand 1
but 1
when 1
anyone 1
else 1
came 1
to 1
ask 1
her 1
to 1
dance 1
he 1
said 1
This 1
lady 1
is 1
dancing 1
with 1
me 1
Thus 1
they 1
danced 1
till 1
a 1
late 1
hour 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
said 1
I 1
shall 1
go 1
and 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
your 1
home 1
for 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
see 1
where 1
the 1
beautiful 1
maiden 1
lived 1
But 1
she 1
slipped 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
unawares 1
and 1
ran 1
off 1
towards 1
home 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
prince 1
followed 1
her 1
she 1
jumped 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
pigeon 1
house 1
and 1
shut 1
the 1
door 1
Then 1
he 1
waited 1
till 1
her 1
father 1
came 1
home 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
unknown 1
maiden 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
at 1
the 1
feast 1
had 1
hid 1
herself 1
in 1
the 1
pigeon 1
house 1
But 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
broken 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
they 1
found 1
no 1
one 1
within 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
came 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
Ashputtel 1
was 1
lying 1
as 1
she 1
always 1
did 1
in 1
her 1
dirty 1
frock 1
by 1
the 1
ashes 1
and 1
her 1
dim 1
little 1
lamp 1
was 1
burning 1
in 1
the 1
chimney 1
For 1
she 1
had 1
run 1
as 1
quickly 1
as 1
she 1
could 1
through 1
the 1
pigeon 1
house 1
and 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
hazel 1
tree 1
and 1
had 1
there 1
taken 1
off 1
her 1
beautiful 1
clothes 1
and 1
put 1
them 1
beneath 1
the 1
tree 1
that 1
the 1
bird 1
might 1
carry 1
them 1
away 1
and 1
had 1
lain 1
down 1
again 1
amid 1
the 1
ashes 1
in 1
her 1
little 1
grey 1
frock 1
The 1
next 1
day 1
when 1
the 1
feast 1
was 1
again 1
held 1
and 1
her 1
father 1
mother 1
and 1
sisters 1
were 1
gone 1
Ashputtel 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
hazel 1
tree 1
and 1
said 1
Shake 1
shake 1
hazel 1
tree 1
Gold 1
and 1
silver 1
over 1
me 1
And 1
the 1
bird 1
came 1
and 1
brought 1
a 1
still 1
finer 1
dress 1
than 1
the 1
one 1
she 1
had 1
worn 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
And 1
when 1
she 1
came 1
in 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
ball 1
everyone 1
wondered 1
at 1
her 1
beauty 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
who 1
was 1
waiting 1
for 1
her 1
took 1
her 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
danced 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
when 1
anyone 1
asked 1
her 1
to 1
dance 1
he 1
said 1
as 1
before 1
This 1
lady 1
is 1
dancing 1
with 1
me 1
When 1
night 1
came 1
she 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
followed 1
here 1
as 1
before 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
see 1
into 1
what 1
house 1
she 1
went 1
but 1
she 1
sprang 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
all 1
at 1
once 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
behind 1
her 1
father 1
s 1
house 1
In 1
this 1
garden 1
stood 1
a 1
fine 1
large 1
pear 1
tree 1
full 1
of 1
ripe 1
fruit 1
and 1
Ashputtel 1
not 1
knowing 1
where 1
to 1
hide 1
herself 1
jumped 1
up 1
into 1
it 1
without 1
being 1
seen 1
Then 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
lost 1
sight 1
of 1
her 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
out 1
where 1
she 1
was 1
gone 1
but 1
waited 1
till 1
her 1
father 1
came 1
home 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
The 1
unknown 1
lady 1
who 1
danced 1
with 1
me 1
has 1
slipped 1
away 1
and 1
I 1
think 1
she 1
must 1
have 1
sprung 1
into 1
the 1
pear 1
tree 1
The 1
father 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
Can 1
it 1
be 1
Ashputtel 1
So 1
he 1
had 1
an 1
axe 1
brought 1
and 1
they 1
cut 1
down 1
the 1
tree 1
but 1
found 1
no 1
one 1
upon 1
it 1
And 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
there 1
lay 1
Ashputtel 1
among 1
the 1
ashes 1
for 1
she 1
had 1
slipped 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
carried 1
her 1
beautiful 1
clothes 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
bird 1
at 1
the 1
hazel 1
tree 1
and 1
then 1
put 1
on 1
her 1
little 1
grey 1
frock 1
The 1
third 1
day 1
when 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
and 1
sisters 1
were 1
gone 1
she 1
went 1
again 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
said 1
Shake 1
shake 1
hazel 1
tree 1
Gold 1
and 1
silver 1
over 1
me 1
Then 1
her 1
kind 1
friend 1
the 1
bird 1
brought 1
a 1
dress 1
still 1
finer 1
than 1
the 1
former 1
one 1
and 1
slippers 1
which 1
were 1
all 1
of 1
gold 1
so 1
that 1
when 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
feast 1
no 1
one 1
knew 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
for 1
wonder 1
at 1
her 1
beauty 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
danced 1
with 1
nobody 1
but 1
her 1
and 1
when 1
anyone 1
else 1
asked 1
her 1
to 1
dance 1
he 1
said 1
This 1
lady 1
is 1
my 1
partner 1
sir 1
When 1
night 1
came 1
she 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
would 1
go 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
lose 1
her 1
this 1
time 1
but 1
however 1
she 1
again 1
slipped 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
though 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
hurry 1
that 1
she 1
dropped 1
her 1
left 1
golden 1
slipper 1
upon 1
the 1
stairs 1
The 1
prince 1
took 1
the 1
shoe 1
and 1
went 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
will 1
take 1
for 1
my 1
wife 1
the 1
lady 1
that 1
this 1
golden 1
slipper 1
fits 1
Then 1
both 1
the 1
sisters 1
were 1
overjoyed 1
to 1
hear 1
it 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
beautiful 1
feet 1
and 1
had 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
they 1
could 1
wear 1
the 1
golden 1
slipper 1
The 1
eldest 1
went 1
first 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
the 1
slipper 1
was 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
try 1
it 1
on 1
and 1
the 1
mother 1
stood 1
by 1
But 1
her 1
great 1
toe 1
could 1
not 1
go 1
into 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
shoe 1
was 1
altogether 1
much 1
too 1
small 1
for 1
her 1
Then 1
the 1
mother 1
gave 1
her 1
a 1
knife 1
and 1
said 1
Never 1
mind 1
cut 1
it 1
off 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
queen 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
care 1
about 1
toes 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
walk 1
So 1
the 1
silly 1
girl 1
cut 1
off 1
her 1
great 1
toe 1
and 1
thus 1
squeezed 1
on 1
the 1
shoe 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
Then 1
he 1
took 1
her 1
for 1
his 1
bride 1
and 1
set 1
her 1
beside 1
him 1
on 1
his 1
horse 1
and 1
rode 1
away 1
with 1
her 1
homewards 1
But 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
home 1
they 1
had 1
to 1
pass 1
by 1
the 1
hazel 1
tree 1
that 1
Ashputtel 1
had 1
planted 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
branch 1
sat 1
a 1
little 1
dove 1
singing 1
Back 1
again 1
back 1
again 1
look 1
to 1
the 1
shoe 1
The 1
shoe 1
is 1
too 1
small 1
and 1
not 1
made 1
for 1
you 1
Prince 1
prince 1
look 1
again 1
for 1
thy 1
bride 1
For 1
she 1
s 1
not 1
the 1
true 1
one 1
that 1
sits 1
by 1
thy 1
side 1
Then 1
the 1
prince 1
got 1
down 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
her 1
foot 1
and 1
he 1
saw 1
by 1
the 1
blood 1
that 1
streamed 1
from 1
it 1
what 1
a 1
trick 1
she 1
had 1
played 1
him 1
So 1
he 1
turned 1
his 1
horse 1
round 1
and 1
brought 1
the 1
false 1
bride 1
back 1
to 1
her 1
home 1
and 1
said 1
This 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
right 1
bride 1
let 1
the 1
other 1
sister 1
try 1
and 1
put 1
on 1
the 1
slipper 1
Then 1
she 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
got 1
her 1
foot 1
into 1
the 1
shoe 1
all 1
but 1
the 1
heel 1
which 1
was 1
too 1
large 1
But 1
her 1
mother 1
squeezed 1
it 1
in 1
till 1
the 1
blood 1
came 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
and 1
he 1
set 1
her 1
as 1
his 1
bride 1
by 1
his 1
side 1
on 1
his 1
horse 1
and 1
rode 1
away 1
with 1
her 1
But 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
hazel 1
tree 1
the 1
little 1
dove 1
sat 1
there 1
still 1
and 1
sang 1
Back 1
again 1
back 1
again 1
look 1
to 1
the 1
shoe 1
The 1
shoe 1
is 1
too 1
small 1
and 1
not 1
made 1
for 1
you 1
Prince 1
prince 1
look 1
again 1
for 1
thy 1
bride 1
For 1
she 1
s 1
not 1
the 1
true 1
one 1
that 1
sits 1
by 1
thy 1
side 1
Then 1
he 1
looked 1
down 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
blood 1
streamed 1
so 1
much 1
from 1
the 1
shoe 1
that 1
her 1
white 1
stockings 1
were 1
quite 1
red 1
So 1
he 1
turned 1
his 1
horse 1
and 1
brought 1
her 1
also 1
back 1
again 1
This 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
true 1
bride 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
the 1
father 1
have 1
you 1
no 1
other 1
daughters 1
No 1
said 1
he 1
there 1
is 1
only 1
a 1
little 1
dirty 1
Ashputtel 1
here 1
the 1
child 1
of 1
my 1
first 1
wife 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
she 1
cannot 1
be 1
the 1
bride 1
The 1
prince 1
told 1
him 1
to 1
send 1
her 1
But 1
the 1
mother 1
said 1
No 1
no 1
she 1
is 1
much 1
too 1
dirty 1
she 1
will 1
not 1
dare 1
to 1
show 1
herself 1
However 1
the 1
prince 1
would 1
have 1
her 1
come 1
and 1
she 1
first 1
washed 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
hands 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
in 1
and 1
curtsied 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
reached 1
her 1
the 1
golden 1
slipper 1
Then 1
she 1
took 1
her 1
clumsy 1
shoe 1
off 1
her 1
left 1
foot 1
and 1
put 1
on 1
the 1
golden 1
slipper 1
and 1
it 1
fitted 1
her 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
made 1
for 1
her 1
And 1
when 1
he 1
drew 1
near 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
her 1
face 1
he 1
knew 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
This 1
is 1
the 1
right 1
bride 1
But 1
the 1
mother 1
and 1
both 1
the 1
sisters 1
were 1
frightened 1
and 1
turned 1
pale 1
with 1
anger 1
as 1
he 1
took 1
Ashputtel 1
on 1
his 1
horse 1
and 1
rode 1
away 1
with 1
her 1
And 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
hazel 1
tree 1
the 1
white 1
dove 1
sang 1
Home 1
home 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
shoe 1
Princess 1
the 1
shoe 1
was 1
made 1
for 1
you 1
Prince 1
prince 1
take 1
home 1
thy 1
bride 1
For 1
she 1
is 1
the 1
true 1
one 1
that 1
sits 1
by 1
thy 1
side 1
And 1
when 1
the 1
dove 1
had 1
done 1
its 1
song 1
it 1
came 1
flying 1
and 1
perched 1
upon 1
her 1
right 1
shoulder 1
and 1
so 1
went 1
home 1
with 1
her 1
THE 1
WHITE 1
SNAKE 1
A 1
long 1
time 1
ago 1
there 1
lived 1
a 1
king 1
who 1
was 1
famed 1
for 1
his 1
wisdom 1
through 1
all 1
the 1
land 1
Nothing 1
was 1
hidden 1
from 1
him 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
as 1
if 1
news 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
secret 1
things 1
was 1
brought 1
to 1
him 1
through 1
the 1
air 1
But 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
strange 1
custom 1
every 1
day 1
after 1
dinner 1
when 1
the 1
table 1
was 1
cleared 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
was 1
present 1
a 1
trusty 1
servant 1
had 1
to 1
bring 1
him 1
one 1
more 1
dish 1
It 1
was 1
covered 1
however 1
and 1
even 1
the 1
servant 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
was 1
in 1
it 1
neither 1
did 1
anyone 1
know 1
for 1
the 1
king 1
never 1
took 1
off 1
the 1
cover 1
to 1
eat 1
of 1
it 1
until 1
he 1
was 1
quite 1
alone 1
This 1
had 1
gone 1
on 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
when 1
one 1
day 1
the 1
servant 1
who 1
took 1
away 1
the 1
dish 1
was 1
overcome 1
with 1
such 1
curiosity 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
carrying 1
the 1
dish 1
into 1
his 1
room 1
When 1
he 1
had 1
carefully 1
locked 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
lifted 1
up 1
the 1
cover 1
and 1
saw 1
a 1
white 1
snake 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
dish 1
But 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
it 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
deny 1
himself 1
the 1
pleasure 1
of 1
tasting 1
it 1
so 1
he 1
cut 1
of 1
a 1
little 1
bit 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
his 1
mouth 1
No 1
sooner 1
had 1
it 1
touched 1
his 1
tongue 1
than 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
strange 1
whispering 1
of 1
little 1
voices 1
outside 1
his 1
window 1
He 1
went 1
and 1
listened 1
and 1
then 1
noticed 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
sparrows 1
who 1
were 1
chattering 1
together 1
and 1
telling 1
one 1
another 1
of 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
things 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
seen 1
in 1
the 1
fields 1
and 1
woods 1
Eating 1
the 1
snake 1
had 1
given 1
him 1
power 1
of 1
understanding 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
animals 1
Now 1
it 1
so 1
happened 1
that 1
on 1
this 1
very 1
day 1
the 1
queen 1
lost 1
her 1
most 1
beautiful 1
ring 1
and 1
suspicion 1
of 1
having 1
stolen 1
it 1
fell 1
upon 1
this 1
trusty 1
servant 1
who 1
was 1
allowed 1
to 1
go 1
everywhere 1
The 1
king 1
ordered 1
the 1
man 1
to 1
be 1
brought 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
threatened 1
with 1
angry 1
words 1
that 1
unless 1
he 1
could 1
before 1
the 1
morrow 1
point 1
out 1
the 1
thief 1
he 1
himself 1
should 1
be 1
looked 1
upon 1
as 1
guilty 1
and 1
executed 1
In 1
vain 1
he 1
declared 1
his 1
innocence 1
he 1
was 1
dismissed 1
with 1
no 1
better 1
answer 1
In 1
his 1
trouble 1
and 1
fear 1
he 1
went 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
courtyard 1
and 1
took 1
thought 1
how 1
to 1
help 1
himself 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
trouble 1
Now 1
some 1
ducks 1
were 1
sitting 1
together 1
quietly 1
by 1
a 1
brook 1
and 1
taking 1
their 1
rest 1
and 1
whilst 1
they 1
were 1
making 1
their 1
feathers 1
smooth 1
with 1
their 1
bills 1
they 1
were 1
having 1
a 1
confidential 1
conversation 1
together 1
The 1
servant 1
stood 1
by 1
and 1
listened 1
They 1
were 1
telling 1
one 1
another 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
places 1
where 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
waddling 1
about 1
all 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
what 1
good 1
food 1
they 1
had 1
found 1
and 1
one 1
said 1
in 1
a 1
pitiful 1
tone 1
Something 1
lies 1
heavy 1
on 1
my 1
stomach 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
eating 1
in 1
haste 1
I 1
swallowed 1
a 1
ring 1
which 1
lay 1
under 1
the 1
queen 1
s 1
window 1
The 1
servant 1
at 1
once 1
seized 1
her 1
by 1
the 1
neck 1
carried 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
cook 1
Here 1
is 1
a 1
fine 1
duck 1
pray 1
kill 1
her 1
Yes 1
said 1
the 1
cook 1
and 1
weighed 1
her 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
she 1
has 1
spared 1
no 1
trouble 1
to 1
fatten 1
herself 1
and 1
has 1
been 1
waiting 1
to 1
be 1
roasted 1
long 1
enough 1
So 1
he 1
cut 1
off 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
being 1
dressed 1
for 1
the 1
spit 1
the 1
queen 1
s 1
ring 1
was 1
found 1
inside 1
her 1
The 1
servant 1
could 1
now 1
easily 1
prove 1
his 1
innocence 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
to 1
make 1
amends 1
for 1
the 1
wrong 1
allowed 1
him 1
to 1
ask 1
a 1
favour 1
and 1
promised 1
him 1
the 1
best 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
court 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
wish 1
for 1
The 1
servant 1
refused 1
everything 1
and 1
only 1
asked 1
for 1
a 1
horse 1
and 1
some 1
money 1
for 1
travelling 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
mind 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
go 1
about 1
a 1
little 1
When 1
his 1
request 1
was 1
granted 1
he 1
set 1
out 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
and 1
one 1
day 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
pond 1
where 1
he 1
saw 1
three 1
fishes 1
caught 1
in 1
the 1
reeds 1
and 1
gasping 1
for 1
water 1
Now 1
though 1
it 1
is 1
said 1
that 1
fishes 1
are 1
dumb 1
he 1
heard 1
them 1
lamenting 1
that 1
they 1
must 1
perish 1
so 1
miserably 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
kind 1
heart 1
he 1
got 1
off 1
his 1
horse 1
and 1
put 1
the 1
three 1
prisoners 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
They 1
leapt 1
with 1
delight 1
put 1
out 1
their 1
heads 1
and 1
cried 1
to 1
him 1
We 1
will 1
remember 1
you 1
and 1
repay 1
you 1
for 1
saving 1
us 1
He 1
rode 1
on 1
and 1
after 1
a 1
while 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
voice 1
in 1
the 1
sand 1
at 1
his 1
feet 1
He 1
listened 1
and 1
heard 1
an 1
ant 1
king 1
complain 1
Why 1
cannot 1
folks 1
with 1
their 1
clumsy 1
beasts 1
keep 1
off 1
our 1
bodies 1
That 1
stupid 1
horse 1
with 1
his 1
heavy 1
hoofs 1
has 1
been 1
treading 1
down 1
my 1
people 1
without 1
mercy 1
So 1
he 1
turned 1
on 1
to 1
a 1
side 1
path 1
and 1
the 1
ant 1
king 1
cried 1
out 1
to 1
him 1
We 1
will 1
remember 1
you 1
one 1
good 1
turn 1
deserves 1
another 1
The 1
path 1
led 1
him 1
into 1
a 1
wood 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
saw 1
two 1
old 1
ravens 1
standing 1
by 1
their 1
nest 1
and 1
throwing 1
out 1
their 1
young 1
ones 1
Out 1
with 1
you 2
idle 1
good 1
for 1
nothing 1
creatures 1
cried 1
they 1
we 1
cannot 1
find 1
food 1
for 1
you 1
any 1
longer 1
you 1
are 1
big 1
enough 1
and 1
can 1
provide 1
for 1
yourselves 1
But 1
the 1
poor 1
young 1
ravens 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
flapping 1
their 1
wings 1
and 1
crying 1
Oh 1
what 1
helpless 1
chicks 1
we 1
are 1
We 1
must 1
shift 1
for 1
ourselves 1
and 1
yet 1
we 1
cannot 1
fly 1
What 1
can 1
we 1
do 1
but 1
lie 1
here 1
and 1
starve 1
So 1
the 1
good 1
young 1
fellow 1
alighted 1
and 1
killed 1
his 1
horse 1
with 1
his 1
sword 1
and 1
gave 1
it 1
to 1
them 1
for 1
food 1
Then 1
they 1
came 1
hopping 1
up 1
to 1
it 1
satisfied 1
their 1
hunger 1
and 1
cried 1
We 1
will 1
remember 1
you 1
one 1
good 1
turn 1
deserves 1
another 1
And 1
now 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
use 1
his 1
own 1
legs 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
walked 1
a 1
long 1
way 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
large 1
city 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
noise 1
and 1
crowd 1
in 1
the 1
streets 1
and 1
a 1
man 1
rode 1
up 1
on 1
horseback 1
crying 1
aloud 1
The 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
wants 1
a 1
husband 1
but 1
whoever 1
seeks 1
her 1
hand 1
must 1
perform 1
a 1
hard 1
task 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
does 1
not 1
succeed 1
he 1
will 1
forfeit 1
his 1
life 1
Many 1
had 1
already 1
made 1
the 1
attempt 1
but 1
in 1
vain 1
nevertheless 1
when 1
the 1
youth 1
saw 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
overcome 1
by 1
her 1
great 1
beauty 1
that 1
he 1
forgot 1
all 1
danger 1
went 1
before 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
declared 1
himself 1
a 1
suitor 1
So 1
he 1
was 1
led 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
sea 1
and 1
a 1
gold 1
ring 1
was 1
thrown 1
into 1
it 1
before 1
his 1
eyes 1
then 1
the 1
king 1
ordered 1
him 1
to 1
fetch 1
this 1
ring 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
and 1
added 1
If 1
you 1
come 1
up 1
again 1
without 1
it 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
thrown 1
in 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
until 1
you 1
perish 1
amid 1
the 1
waves 1
All 1
the 1
people 1
grieved 1
for 1
the 1
handsome 1
youth 1
then 1
they 1
went 1
away 1
leaving 1
him 1
alone 1
by 1
the 1
sea 1
He 1
stood 1
on 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
considered 1
what 1
he 1
should 1
do 1
when 1
suddenly 1
he 1
saw 1
three 1
fishes 1
come 1
swimming 1
towards 1
him 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
the 1
very 1
fishes 1
whose 1
lives 1
he 1
had 1
saved 1
The 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
held 1
a 1
mussel 1
in 1
its 1
mouth 1
which 1
it 1
laid 1
on 1
the 1
shore 1
at 1
the 1
youth 1
s 1
feet 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
opened 1
it 1
there 1
lay 1
the 1
gold 1
ring 1
in 1
the 1
shell 1
Full 1
of 1
joy 1
he 1
took 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
expected 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
grant 1
him 1
the 1
promised 1
reward 1
But 1
when 1
the 1
proud 1
princess 1
perceived 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
her 1
equal 1
in 1
birth 1
she 1
scorned 1
him 1
and 1
required 1
him 1
first 1
to 1
perform 1
another 1
task 1
She 1
went 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
strewed 1
with 1
her 1
own 1
hands 1
ten 1
sacksful 1
of 1
millet 1
seed 1
on 1
the 1
grass 1
then 1
she 1
said 1
Tomorrow 1
morning 1
before 1
sunrise 1
these 1
must 1
be 1
picked 1
up 1
and 1
not 1
a 1
single 1
grain 1
be 1
wanting 1
The 1
youth 1
sat 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
considered 1
how 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
possible 1
to 1
perform 1
this 1
task 1
but 1
he 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
nothing 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
sat 1
sorrowfully 1
awaiting 1
the 1
break 1
of 1
day 1
when 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
led 1
to 1
death 1
But 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
first 1
rays 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
shone 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
he 1
saw 1
all 1
the 1
ten 1
sacks 1
standing 1
side 1
by 1
side 1
quite 1
full 1
and 1
not 1
a 1
single 1
grain 1
was 1
missing 1
The 1
ant 1
king 1
had 1
come 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
with 1
thousands 1
and 1
thousands 1
of 1
ants 1
and 1
the 1
grateful 1
creatures 1
had 1
by 1
great 1
industry 1
picked 1
up 1
all 1
the 1
millet 1
seed 1
and 1
gathered 1
them 1
into 1
the 1
sacks 1
Presently 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
herself 1
came 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
was 1
amazed 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
had 1
done 1
the 1
task 1
she 1
had 1
given 1
him 1
But 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
yet 1
conquer 1
her 1
proud 1
heart 1
and 1
said 1
Although 1
he 1
has 1
performed 1
both 1
the 1
tasks 1
he 1
shall 1
not 1
be 1
my 1
husband 1
until 1
he 1
had 1
brought 1
me 1
an 1
apple 1
from 1
the 1
Tree 1
of 1
Life 1
The 1
youth 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
where 1
the 1
Tree 1
of 1
Life 1
stood 1
but 1
he 1
set 1
out 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
gone 1
on 1
for 1
ever 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
his 1
legs 1
would 1
carry 1
him 1
though 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
hope 1
of 1
finding 1
it 1
After 1
he 1
had 1
wandered 1
through 1
three 1
kingdoms 1
he 1
came 1
one 1
evening 1
to 1
a 1
wood 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
under 1
a 1
tree 1
to 1
sleep 1
But 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
rustling 1
in 1
the 1
branches 1
and 1
a 1
golden 1
apple 1
fell 1
into 1
his 1
hand 1
At 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
three 1
ravens 1
flew 1
down 1
to 1
him 1
perched 1
themselves 1
upon 1
his 1
knee 1
and 1
said 1
We 1
are 1
the 1
three 1
young 1
ravens 1
whom 1
you 1
saved 1
from 1
starving 1
when 1
we 1
had 1
grown 1
big 1
and 1
heard 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
seeking 1
the 1
Golden 1
Apple 1
we 1
flew 1
over 1
the 1
sea 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
where 1
the 1
Tree 1
of 1
Life 1
stands 1
and 1
have 1
brought 1
you 1
the 1
apple 1
The 1
youth 1
full 1
of 1
joy 1
set 1
out 1
homewards 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
Golden 1
Apple 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
beautiful 1
daughter 1
who 1
had 1
now 1
no 1
more 1
excuses 1
left 1
to 1
make 1
They 1
cut 1
the 1
Apple 1
of 1
Life 1
in 1
two 1
and 1
ate 1
it 1
together 1
and 1
then 1
her 1
heart 1
became 1
full 1
of 1
love 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
they 1
lived 1
in 1
undisturbed 1
happiness 1
to 1
a 1
great 1
age 1
THE 1
WOLF 1
AND 1
THE 1
SEVEN 1
LITTLE 1
KIDS 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
an 1
old 1
goat 1
who 1
had 1
seven 1
little 1
kids 1
and 1
loved 1
them 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
a 1
mother 1
for 1
her 1
children 1
One 1
day 1
she 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
fetch 1
some 1
food 1
So 1
she 1
called 1
all 1
seven 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
Dear 1
children 1
I 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
be 1
on 1
your 1
guard 1
against 1
the 1
wolf 1
if 1
he 1
comes 1
in 1
he 1
will 1
devour 1
you 1
all 1
skin 1
hair 1
and 1
everything 1
The 1
wretch 1
often 1
disguises 1
himself 1
but 1
you 1
will 1
know 1
him 1
at 1
once 1
by 1
his 1
rough 1
voice 1
and 1
his 1
black 1
feet 1
The 1
kids 1
said 1
Dear 1
mother 1
we 1
will 1
take 1
good 1
care 1
of 1
ourselves 1
you 1
may 1
go 1
away 1
without 1
any 1
anxiety 1
Then 1
the 1
old 1
one 1
bleated 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
her 1
way 1
with 1
an 1
easy 1
mind 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
someone 1
knocked 1
at 1
the 1
house 1
door 1
and 1
called 1
Open 1
the 1
door 1
dear 1
children 1
your 1
mother 1
is 1
here 1
and 1
has 1
brought 1
something 1
back 1
with 1
her 1
for 1
each 1
of 1
you 1
But 1
the 1
little 1
kids 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
wolf 1
by 1
the 1
rough 1
voice 1
We 1
will 1
not 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
cried 1
they 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
our 1
mother 1
She 1
has 1
a 1
soft 1
pleasant 1
voice 1
but 1
your 1
voice 1
is 1
rough 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
wolf 1
Then 1
the 1
wolf 1
went 1
away 1
to 1
a 1
shopkeeper 1
and 1
bought 1
himself 1
a 1
great 1
lump 1
of 1
chalk 1
ate 1
this 1
and 1
made 1
his 1
voice 1
soft 1
with 1
it 1
Then 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
knocked 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
called 1
Open 1
the 1
door 1
dear 1
children 1
your 1
mother 1
is 1
here 1
and 1
has 1
brought 1
something 1
back 1
with 1
her 1
for 1
each 1
of 1
you 1
But 1
the 1
wolf 1
had 1
laid 1
his 1
black 1
paws 1
against 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
the 1
children 1
saw 1
them 1
and 1
cried 1
We 1
will 1
not 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
our 1
mother 1
has 1
not 1
black 1
feet 1
like 1
you 2
are 1
the 1
wolf 1
Then 1
the 1
wolf 1
ran 1
to 1
a 1
baker 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
have 1
hurt 1
my 1
feet 1
rub 1
some 1
dough 1
over 1
them 1
for 1
me 1
And 1
when 1
the 1
baker 1
had 1
rubbed 1
his 1
feet 1
over 1
he 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
miller 1
and 1
said 1
Strew 1
some 1
white 1
meal 1
over 1
my 1
feet 1
for 1
me 1
The 1
miller 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
The 1
wolf 1
wants 1
to 1
deceive 1
someone 1
and 1
refused 1
but 1
the 1
wolf 1
said 1
If 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
I 1
will 1
devour 1
you 1
Then 1
the 1
miller 1
was 1
afraid 1
and 1
made 1
his 1
paws 1
white 1
for 1
him 1
Truly 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
mankind 1
So 1
now 1
the 1
wretch 1
went 1
for 1
the 1
third 1
time 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
door 1
knocked 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
Open 1
the 1
door 1
for 1
me 1
children 1
your 1
dear 1
little 1
mother 1
has 1
come 1
home 1
and 1
has 1
brought 1
every 1
one 1
of 1
you 1
something 1
back 1
from 1
the 1
forest 1
with 1
her 1
The 1
little 1
kids 1
cried 1
First 1
show 1
us 1
your 1
paws 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
know 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
our 1
dear 1
little 1
mother 1
Then 1
he 1
put 1
his 1
paws 1
in 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
kids 1
saw 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
white 1
they 1
believed 1
that 1
all 1
he 1
said 1
was 1
true 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
But 1
who 1
should 1
come 1
in 1
but 1
the 1
wolf 1
They 1
were 1
terrified 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
hide 1
themselves 1
One 1
sprang 1
under 1
the 1
table 1
the 1
second 1
into 1
the 1
bed 1
the 1
third 1
into 1
the 1
stove 1
the 1
fourth 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
the 1
fifth 1
into 1
the 1
cupboard 1
the 1
sixth 1
under 1
the 1
washing 1
bowl 1
and 1
the 1
seventh 1
into 1
the 1
clock 1
case 1
But 1
the 1
wolf 1
found 1
them 1
all 1
and 1
used 1
no 1
great 1
ceremony 1
one 1
after 1
the 1
other 1
he 1
swallowed 1
them 1
down 1
his 1
throat 1
The 1
youngest 1
who 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
clock 1
case 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
find 1
When 1
the 1
wolf 1
had 1
satisfied 1
his 1
appetite 1
he 1
took 1
himself 1
off 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
under 1
a 1
tree 1
in 1
the 1
green 1
meadow 1
outside 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
sleep 1
Soon 1
afterwards 1
the 1
old 1
goat 1
came 1
home 1
again 1
from 1
the 1
forest 1
Ah 1
what 1
a 1
sight 1
she 1
saw 1
there 1
The 1
house 1
door 1
stood 1
wide 1
open 1
The 1
table 1
chairs 1
and 1
benches 1
were 1
thrown 1
down 1
the 1
washing 1
bowl 1
lay 1
broken 1
to 1
pieces 1
and 1
the 1
quilts 1
and 1
pillows 1
were 1
pulled 1
off 1
the 1
bed 1
She 1
sought 1
her 1
children 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
nowhere 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
She 1
called 1
them 1
one 1
after 1
another 1
by 1
name 1
but 1
no 1
one 1
answered 1
At 1
last 1
when 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
youngest 1
a 1
soft 1
voice 1
cried 1
Dear 1
mother 1
I 1
am 1
in 1
the 1
clock 1
case 1
She 1
took 1
the 1
kid 1
out 1
and 1
it 1
told 1
her 1
that 1
the 1
wolf 1
had 1
come 1
and 1
had 1
eaten 1
all 1
the 1
others 1
Then 1
you 1
may 1
imagine 1
how 1
she 1
wept 1
over 1
her 1
poor 1
children 1
At 1
length 1
in 1
her 1
grief 1
she 1
went 1
out 1
and 1
the 1
youngest 1
kid 1
ran 1
with 1
her 1
When 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
meadow 1
there 1
lay 1
the 1
wolf 1
by 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
snored 1
so 1
loud 1
that 1
the 1
branches 1
shook 1
She 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
on 1
every 1
side 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
something 1
was 1
moving 1
and 1
struggling 1
in 1
his 1
gorged 1
belly 1
Ah 1
heavens 1
she 1
said 1
is 1
it 1
possible 1
that 1
my 1
poor 1
children 1
whom 1
he 1
has 1
swallowed 1
down 1
for 1
his 1
supper 1
can 1
be 1
still 1
alive 1
Then 1
the 1
kid 1
had 1
to 1
run 1
home 1
and 1
fetch 1
scissors 1
and 1
a 1
needle 1
and 1
thread 1
and 1
the 1
goat 1
cut 1
open 1
the 1
monster 1
s 1
stomach 1
and 1
hardly 1
had 1
she 1
made 1
one 1
cut 1
than 1
one 1
little 1
kid 1
thrust 1
its 1
head 1
out 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
cut 1
farther 1
all 1
six 1
sprang 1
out 1
one 1
after 1
another 1
and 1
were 1
all 1
still 1
alive 1
and 1
had 1
suffered 1
no 1
injury 1
whatever 1
for 1
in 1
his 1
greediness 1
the 1
monster 1
had 1
swallowed 1
them 1
down 1
whole 1
What 1
rejoicing 1
there 1
was 1
They 1
embraced 1
their 1
dear 1
mother 1
and 1
jumped 1
like 1
a 1
tailor 1
at 1
his 1
wedding 1
The 1
mother 1
however 1
said 1
Now 1
go 1
and 1
look 1
for 1
some 1
big 1
stones 1
and 1
we 1
will 1
fill 1
the 1
wicked 1
beast 1
s 1
stomach 1
with 1
them 1
while 1
he 1
is 1
still 1
asleep 1
Then 1
the 1
seven 1
kids 1
dragged 1
the 1
stones 1
thither 1
with 1
all 1
speed 1
and 1
put 1
as 1
many 1
of 1
them 1
into 1
this 1
stomach 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
get 1
in 1
and 1
the 1
mother 1
sewed 1
him 1
up 1
again 1
in 1
the 1
greatest 1
haste 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
aware 1
of 1
anything 1
and 1
never 1
once 1
stirred 1
When 1
the 1
wolf 1
at 1
length 1
had 2
his 1
fill 1
of 1
sleep 1
he 1
got 1
on 1
his 1
legs 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
stones 1
in 1
his 1
stomach 1
made 1
him 1
very 1
thirsty 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
a 1
well 1
to 1
drink 1
But 1
when 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
walk 1
and 1
to 1
move 1
about 1
the 1
stones 1
in 1
his 1
stomach 1
knocked 1
against 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
rattled 1
Then 1
cried 1
he 1
What 1
rumbles 1
and 1
tumbles 1
Against 1
my 1
poor 1
bones 1
I 1
thought 1
twas 1
six 1
kids 1
But 1
it 1
feels 1
like 1
big 1
stones 1
And 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
stooped 1
over 1
the 1
water 1
to 1
drink 1
the 1
heavy 1
stones 1
made 1
him 1
fall 1
in 1
and 1
he 1
drowned 1
miserably 1
When 1
the 1
seven 1
kids 1
saw 1
that 1
they 1
came 1
running 1
to 1
the 1
spot 1
and 1
cried 1
aloud 1
The 1
wolf 1
is 1
dead 1
The 1
wolf 1
is 1
dead 1
and 1
danced 1
for 1
joy 1
round 1
about 1
the 1
well 1
with 1
their 1
mother 1
THE 1
QUEEN 1
BEE 1
Two 1
kings 1
sons 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
seek 1
their 1
fortunes 1
but 1
they 1
soon 1
fell 1
into 1
a 1
wasteful 1
foolish 1
way 1
of 1
living 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
return 1
home 1
again 1
Then 1
their 1
brother 1
who 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
insignificant 1
dwarf 1
went 1
out 1
to 1
seek 1
for 1
his 1
brothers 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
found 1
them 1
they 1
only 1
laughed 1
at 1
him 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
he 1
who 1
was 1
so 1
young 1
and 1
simple 1
should 1
try 1
to 1
travel 1
through 1
the 1
world 1
when 1
they 1
who 1
were 1
so 1
much 1
wiser 1
had 1
been 1
unable 1
to 1
get 1
on 1
However 1
they 1
all 1
set 1
out 1
on 1
their 1
journey 1
together 1
and 1
came 1
at 1
last 1
to 1
an 1
ant 1
hill 1
The 1
two 1
elder 1
brothers 1
would 1
have 1
pulled 1
it 1
down 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
see 1
how 1
the 1
poor 1
ants 1
in 1
their 1
fright 1
would 1
run 1
about 1
and 1
carry 1
off 1
their 1
eggs 1
But 1
the 1
little 1
dwarf 1
said 1
Let 1
the 1
poor 1
things 1
enjoy 1
themselves 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
suffer 1
you 1
to 1
trouble 1
them 1
So 1
on 1
they 1
went 1
and 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
lake 1
where 1
many 2
ducks 1
were 1
swimming 1
about 1
The 1
two 1
brothers 1
wanted 1
to 1
catch 1
two 1
and 1
roast 1
them 1
But 1
the 1
dwarf 1
said 1
Let 1
the 1
poor 1
things 1
enjoy 1
themselves 1
you 1
shall 1
not 1
kill 1
them 1
Next 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
bees 1
nest 1
in 1
a 1
hollow 1
tree 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
so 1
much 1
honey 1
that 1
it 1
ran 1
down 1
the 1
trunk 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
brothers 1
wanted 1
to 1
light 1
a 1
fire 1
under 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
kill 1
the 1
bees 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
get 1
their 1
honey 1
But 1
the 1
dwarf 1
held 1
them 1
back 1
and 1
said 1
Let 1
the 1
pretty 1
insects 1
enjoy 1
themselves 1
I 1
cannot 1
let 1
you 1
burn 1
them 1
At 1
length 1
the 1
three 1
brothers 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
castle 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
passed 1
by 1
the 1
stables 1
they 1
saw 1
fine 1
horses 1
standing 1
there 1
but 1
all 1
were 1
of 1
marble 1
and 1
no 1
man 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
Then 1
they 1
went 1
through 1
all 1
the 1
rooms 1
till 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
door 1
on 1
which 1
were 1
three 1
locks 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
a 1
wicket 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
could 1
look 1
into 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
There 1
they 1
saw 1
a 1
little 1
grey 1
old 1
man 1
sitting 1
at 1
a 1
table 1
and 1
they 1
called 1
to 1
him 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
but 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
hear 1
however 1
they 1
called 1
a 1
third 1
time 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
rose 1
and 1
came 1
out 1
to 1
them 1
He 1
said 1
nothing 1
but 1
took 1
hold 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
led 1
them 1
to 1
a 1
beautiful 1
table 1
covered 1
with 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
good 1
things 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
eaten 1
and 1
drunk 1
he 1
showed 1
each 1
of 1
them 1
to 1
a 1
bed 1
chamber 1
The 1
next 1
morning 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
eldest 1
and 1
took 1
him 1
to 1
a 1
marble 1
table 1
where 1
there 1
were 1
three 1
tablets 1
containing 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
means 1
by 1
which 1
the 1
castle 1
might 1
be 1
disenchanted 1
The 1
first 1
tablet 1
said 1
In 1
the 1
wood 1
under 1
the 1
moss 1
lie 1
the 1
thousand 1
pearls 1
belonging 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
they 1
must 1
all 1
be 1
found 1
and 1
if 1
one 1
be 1
missing 1
by 1
set 1
of 1
sun 1
he 1
who 1
seeks 1
them 1
will 1
be 1
turned 1
into 1
marble 1
The 1
eldest 1
brother 1
set 1
out 1
and 1
sought 1
for 1
the 1
pearls 1
the 1
whole 1
day 1
but 1
the 1
evening 1
came 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
found 1
the 1
first 1
hundred 1
so 1
he 1
was 1
turned 1
into 1
stone 1
as 1
the 1
tablet 1
had 1
foretold 1
The 1
next 1
day 1
the 1
second 1
brother 1
undertook 1
the 1
task 1
but 1
he 1
succeeded 1
no 1
better 1
than 1
the 1
first 1
for 1
he 1
could 1
only 1
find 1
the 1
second 1
hundred 1
of 1
the 1
pearls 1
and 1
therefore 1
he 1
too 1
was 1
turned 1
into 1
stone 1
At 1
last 1
came 1
the 1
little 1
dwarf 1
s 1
turn 1
and 1
he 1
looked 1
in 1
the 1
moss 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
hard 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
pearls 1
and 1
the 1
job 1
was 1
so 1
tiresome 1
so 1
he 1
sat 1
down 1
upon 1
a 1
stone 1
and 1
cried 1
And 1
as 1
he 1
sat 1
there 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
the 1
ants 1
whose 1
life 1
he 1
had 1
saved 1
came 1
to 1
help 1
him 1
with 1
five 1
thousand 1
ants 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
they 1
had 1
found 1
all 1
the 1
pearls 1
and 1
laid 1
them 1
in 1
a 1
heap 1
The 1
second 1
tablet 1
said 1
The 1
key 1
of 1
the 1
princess 1
s 1
bed 1
chamber 1
must 1
be 1
fished 1
up 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
And 1
as 1
the 1
dwarf 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
brink 1
of 1
it 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
two 1
ducks 1
whose 1
lives 1
he 1
had 1
saved 1
swimming 1
about 1
and 1
they 1
dived 1
down 1
and 1
soon 1
brought 1
in 1
the 1
key 1
from 1
the 1
bottom 1
The 1
third 1
task 1
was 1
the 1
hardest 1
It 1
was 1
to 1
choose 1
out 1
the 1
youngest 1
and 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
three 1
daughters 1
Now 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
beautiful 1
and 1
all 1
exactly 1
alike 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
told 1
that 1
the 1
eldest 1
had 1
eaten 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
sugar 1
the 1
next 1
some 1
sweet 1
syrup 1
and 1
the 1
youngest 1
a 1
spoonful 1
of 1
honey 1
so 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
guess 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
had 1
eaten 1
the 1
honey 1
Then 1
came 1
the 1
queen 1
of 1
the 1
bees 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
saved 1
by 1
the 1
little 1
dwarf 1
from 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
she 1
tried 1
the 1
lips 1
of 1
all 1
three 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
she 1
sat 1
upon 1
the 1
lips 1
of 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
had 1
eaten 1
the 1
honey 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
dwarf 1
knew 1
which 1
was 1
the 1
youngest 1
Thus 1
the 1
spell 1
was 1
broken 1
and 1
all 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
turned 1
into 1
stones 1
awoke 1
and 1
took 1
their 1
proper 1
forms 1
And 1
the 1
dwarf 1
married 1
the 1
youngest 1
and 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
the 1
princesses 1
and 1
was 1
king 1
after 1
her 1
father 1
s 1
death 1
but 1
his 1
two 1
brothers 1
married 1
the 1
other 1
two 1
sisters 1
THE 1
ELVES 1
AND 1
THE 1
SHOEMAKER 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
shoemaker 1
who 1
worked 1
very 1
hard 1
and 1
was 1
very 1
honest 1
but 1
still 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
earn 1
enough 1
to 1
live 1
upon 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
all 1
he 1
had 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
was 1
gone 1
save 1
just 1
leather 1
enough 1
to 1
make 1
one 1
pair 1
of 1
shoes 1
Then 1
he 1
cut 1
his 1
leather 1
out 1
all 1
ready 1
to 1
make 1
up 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
meaning 1
to 1
rise 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
to 1
his 1
work 1
His 1
conscience 1
was 1
clear 1
and 1
his 1
heart 1
light 1
amidst 1
all 1
his 1
troubles 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
peaceably 1
to 1
bed 1
left 1
all 1
his 1
cares 1
to 1
Heaven 1
and 1
soon 1
fell 1
asleep 1
In 1
the 1
morning 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
said 1
his 1
prayers 1
he 1
sat 1
himself 1
down 1
to 1
his 1
work 1
when 1
to 1
his 1
great 1
wonder 1
there 1
stood 1
the 1
shoes 1
all 1
ready 1
made 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
The 1
good 1
man 1
knew 1
not 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
or 1
think 1
at 1
such 1
an 1
odd 1
thing 1
happening 1
He 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
workmanship 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
one 1
false 1
stitch 1
in 1
the 1
whole 1
job 1
all 1
was 1
so 1
neat 1
and 1
true 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
a 1
masterpiece 1
The 1
same 1
day 1
a 1
customer 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
the 1
shoes 1
suited 1
him 1
so 1
well 1
that 1
he 1
willingly 1
paid 1
a 1
price 1
higher 1
than 1
usual 1
for 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
poor 1
shoemaker 1
with 1
the 1
money 1
bought 1
leather 1
enough 1
to 1
make 1
two 1
pairs 1
more 1
In 1
the 1
evening 1
he 1
cut 1
out 1
the 1
work 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
early 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
get 1
up 1
and 1
begin 1
betimes 1
next 1
day 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
saved 1
all 1
the 1
trouble 1
for 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
the 1
work 1
was 1
done 1
ready 1
to 1
his 1
hand 1
Soon 1
in 1
came 1
buyers 1
who 1
paid 1
him 1
handsomely 1
for 1
his 1
goods 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
bought 1
leather 1
enough 1
for 1
four 1
pair 1
more 1
He 1
cut 1
out 1
the 1
work 1
again 1
overnight 1
and 1
found 1
it 1
done 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
as 1
before 1
and 1
so 1
it 1
went 1
on 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
what 1
was 1
got 1
ready 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
was 1
always 1
done 1
by 1
daybreak 1
and 1
the 1
good 1
man 1
soon 1
became 1
thriving 1
and 1
well 1
off 1
again 1
One 1
evening 1
about 1
Christmas 1
time 1
as 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
were 1
sitting 1
over 1
the 1
fire 1
chatting 1
together 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
sit 1
up 1
and 1
watch 1
tonight 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
see 1
who 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
comes 1
and 1
does 1
my 1
work 1
for 1
me 1
The 1
wife 1
liked 1
the 1
thought 1
so 1
they 1
left 1
a 1
light 1
burning 1
and 1
hid 1
themselves 1
in 1
a 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
behind 1
a 1
curtain 1
that 1
was 1
hung 1
up 1
there 1
and 1
watched 1
what 1
would 1
happen 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
midnight 1
there 1
came 1
in 1
two 1
little 1
naked 1
dwarfs 1
and 1
they 1
sat 1
themselves 1
upon 1
the 1
shoemaker 1
s 1
bench 1
took 1
up 1
all 1
the 1
work 1
that 1
was 1
cut 1
out 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
ply 1
with 1
their 1
little 1
fingers 1
stitching 1
and 1
rapping 1
and 1
tapping 1
away 1
at 1
such 1
a 1
rate 1
that 1
the 1
shoemaker 1
was 1
all 1
wonder 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
take 1
his 1
eyes 1
off 1
them 1
And 1
on 1
they 1
went 1
till 1
the 1
job 1
was 1
quite 1
done 1
and 1
the 1
shoes 1
stood 1
ready 1
for 1
use 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
This 1
was 1
long 1
before 1
daybreak 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
bustled 1
away 1
as 1
quick 1
as 1
lightning 1
The 1
next 1
day 1
the 1
wife 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
shoemaker 1
These 1
little 1
wights 1
have 1
made 1
us 1
rich 1
and 1
we 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
thankful 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
do 1
them 1
a 1
good 1
turn 1
if 1
we 1
can 1
I 1
am 1
quite 1
sorry 1
to 1
see 1
them 1
run 1
about 1
as 1
they 1
do 1
and 1
indeed 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
very 1
decent 1
for 1
they 1
have 1
nothing 1
upon 1
their 1
backs 1
to 1
keep 1
off 1
the 1
cold 1
I 1
ll 1
tell 1
you 1
what 1
I 1
will 1
make 1
each 1
of 1
them 1
a 1
shirt 1
and 1
a 1
coat 1
and 1
waistcoat 1
and 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
pantaloons 1
into 1
the 1
bargain 1
and 1
do 1
you 1
make 1
each 1
of 1
them 1
a 1
little 1
pair 1
of 1
shoes 1
The 1
thought 1
pleased 1
the 1
good 1
cobbler 1
very 1
much 1
and 1
one 1
evening 1
when 1
all 1
the 1
things 1
were 1
ready 1
they 1
laid 1
them 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
instead 1
of 1
the 1
work 1
that 1
they 1
used 1
to 1
cut 1
out 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
and 1
hid 1
themselves 1
to 1
watch 1
what 1
the 1
little 1
elves 1
would 1
do 1
About 1
midnight 1
in 1
they 1
came 1
dancing 1
and 1
skipping 1
hopped 1
round 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
to 1
sit 1
down 1
to 1
their 1
work 1
as 1
usual 1
but 1
when 1
they 1
saw 1
the 1
clothes 1
lying 1
for 1
them 1
they 1
laughed 1
and 1
chuckled 1
and 1
seemed 1
mightily 1
delighted 1
Then 1
they 1
dressed 1
themselves 1
in 1
the 1
twinkling 1
of 1
an 1
eye 1
and 1
danced 1
and 1
capered 1
and 1
sprang 1
about 1
as 1
merry 1
as 1
could 1
be 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
danced 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
away 1
over 1
the 1
green 1
The 1
good 1
couple 1
saw 1
them 1
no 1
more 1
but 1
everything 1
went 1
well 1
with 1
them 1
from 1
that 1
time 1
forward 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
they 1
lived 1
THE 1
JUNIPER 1
TREE 1
Long 1
long 1
ago 1
some 1
two 1
thousand 1
years 1
or 1
so 1
there 1
lived 1
a 1
rich 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
good 1
and 1
beautiful 1
wife 1
They 1
loved 1
each 1
other 1
dearly 1
but 1
sorrowed 1
much 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
children 1
So 1
greatly 1
did 1
they 1
desire 1
to 1
have 1
one 1
that 1
the 1
wife 1
prayed 1
for 1
it 1
day 1
and 1
night 1
but 1
still 1
they 1
remained 1
childless 1
In 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
court 1
in 1
which 1
grew 1
a 1
juniper 1
tree 1
One 1
winter 1
s 1
day 1
the 1
wife 1
stood 1
under 1
the 1
tree 1
to 1
peel 1
some 1
apples 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
peeling 1
them 1
she 1
cut 1
her 1
finger 1
and 1
the 1
blood 1
fell 1
on 1
the 1
snow 1
Ah 1
sighed 1
the 1
woman 1
heavily 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
but 1
a 1
child 1
as 1
red 1
as 1
blood 1
and 1
as 1
white 1
as 1
snow 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
spoke 1
the 1
words 1
her 1
heart 1
grew 1
light 1
within 1
her 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
her 1
that 1
her 1
wish 1
was 1
granted 1
and 1
she 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
feeling 1
glad 1
and 1
comforted 1
A 1
month 1
passed 1
and 1
the 1
snow 1
had 1
all 1
disappeared 1
then 1
another 1
month 1
went 1
by 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
earth 1
was 1
green 1
So 1
the 1
months 1
followed 1
one 1
another 1
and 1
first 1
the 1
trees 1
budded 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
soon 1
the 1
green 1
branches 1
grew 1
thickly 1
intertwined 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
blossoms 1
began 1
to 1
fall 1
Once 1
again 1
the 1
wife 1
stood 1
under 1
the 1
juniper 1
tree 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
full 1
of 1
sweet 1
scent 1
that 1
her 1
heart 1
leaped 1
for 1
joy 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
overcome 1
with 1
her 1
happiness 1
that 1
she 1
fell 1
on 1
her 1
knees 1
Presently 1
the 1
fruit 1
became 1
round 1
and 1
firm 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
glad 1
and 1
at 1
peace 1
but 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
fully 1
ripe 1
she 1
picked 1
the 1
berries 1
and 1
ate 1
eagerly 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
grew 1
sad 1
and 1
ill 1
A 1
little 1
while 1
later 1
she 1
called 1
her 1
husband 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
weeping 1
If 1
I 1
die 1
bury 1
me 1
under 1
the 1
juniper 1
tree 1
Then 1
she 1
felt 1
comforted 1
and 1
happy 1
again 1
and 1
before 1
another 1
month 1
had 1
passed 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
little 1
child 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
white 1
as 1
snow 1
and 1
as 1
red 1
as 1
blood 1
her 1
joy 1
was 1
so 1
great 1
that 1
she 1
died 1
Her 1
husband 1
buried 1
her 1
under 1
the 1
juniper 1
tree 1
and 1
wept 1
bitterly 1
for 1
her 1
By 1
degrees 1
however 1
his 1
sorrow 1
grew 1
less 1
and 1
although 1
at 1
times 1
he 1
still 1
grieved 1
over 1
his 1
loss 1
he 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
go 1
about 1
as 1
usual 1
and 1
later 1
on 1
he 1
married 1
again 1
He 1
now 1
had 1
a 1
little 1
daughter 1
born 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
child 1
of 1
his 1
first 1
wife 1
was 1
a 1
boy 1
who 1
was 1
as 1
red 1
as 1
blood 1
and 1
as 1
white 1
as 1
snow 1
The 1
mother 1
loved 1
her 1
daughter 1
very 1
much 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
looked 1
at 1
her 1
and 1
then 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
boy 1
it 1
pierced 1
her 1
heart 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
always 1
stand 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
child 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
continually 1
thinking 1
how 1
she 1
could 1
get 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
the 1
property 1
for 1
her 1
This 1
evil 1
thought 1
took 1
possession 1
of 1
her 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
and 1
made 1
her 1
behave 1
very 1
unkindly 1
to 1
the 1
boy 1
She 1
drove 1
him 1
from 1
place 1
to 1
place 1
with 1
cuffings 1
and 1
buffetings 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
poor 1
child 1
went 1
about 1
in 1
fear 1
and 1
had 1
no 1
peace 1
from 1
the 1
time 1
he 1
left 1
school 1
to 1
the 1
time 1
he 1
went 1
back 1
One 1
day 1
the 1
little 1
daughter 1
came 1
running 1
to 1
her 1
mother 1
in 1
the 1
store 1
room 1
and 1
said 1
Mother 1
give 1
me 1
an 1
apple 1
Yes 1
my 1
child 1
said 1
the 1
wife 1
and 1
she 1
gave 1
her 1
a 1
beautiful 1
apple 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
chest 1
the 1
chest 1
had 1
a 1
very 1
heavy 1
lid 1
and 1
a 1
large 1
iron 1
lock 1
Mother 1
said 1
the 1
little 1
daughter 1
again 1
may 1
not 1
brother 1
have 1
one 1
too 1
The 1
mother 1
was 1
angry 1
at 1
this 1
but 1
she 1
answered 1
Yes 1
when 1
he 1
comes 1
out 1
of 1
school 1
Just 1
then 1
she 1
looked 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
saw 1
him 1
coming 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
as 1
if 1
an 1
evil 1
spirit 1
entered 1
into 1
her 1
for 1
she 1
snatched 1
the 1
apple 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
little 1
daughter 1
s 1
hand 1
and 1
said 1
You 1
shall 1
not 1
have 1
one 1
before 1
your 1
brother 1
She 1
threw 1
the 1
apple 1
into 1
the 1
chest 1
and 1
shut 1
it 1
to 1
The 1
little 1
boy 1
now 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
the 1
evil 1
spirit 1
in 1
the 1
wife 1
made 1
her 1
say 1
kindly 1
to 1
him 1
My 1
son 1
will 1
you 1
have 1
an 1
apple 1
but 1
she 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
wicked 1
look 1
Mother 1
said 1
the 1
boy 1
how 1
dreadful 1
you 1
look 1
Yes 1
give 1
me 1
an 1
apple 1
The 1
thought 1
came 1
to 1
her 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
kill 1
him 1
Come 1
with 1
me 1
she 1
said 1
and 1
she 1
lifted 1
up 1
the 1
lid 1
of 1
the 1
chest 1
take 1
one 1
out 1
for 1
yourself 1
And 1
as 1
he 1
bent 1
over 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
the 1
evil 1
spirit 1
urged 1
her 1
and 1
crash 1
down 1
went 1
the 1
lid 1
and 1
off 1
went 1
the 1
little 1
boy 1
s 1
head 1
Then 1
she 1
was 1
overwhelmed 1
with 1
fear 1
at 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
If 1
only 1
I 1
can 1
prevent 1
anyone 1
knowing 1
that 1
I 1
did 1
it 1
she 1
thought 1
So 1
she 1
went 1
upstairs 1
to 1
her 1
room 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
white 1
handkerchief 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
top 1
drawer 1
then 1
she 1
set 1
the 1
boy 1
s 1
head 1
again 1
on 1
his 1
shoulders 1
and 1
bound 1
it 1
with 1
the 1
handkerchief 1
so 1
that 1
nothing 1
could 1
be 1
seen 1
and 1
placed 1
him 1
on 1
a 1
chair 1
by 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
an 1
apple 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
Soon 1
after 1
this 1
little 1
Marleen 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
mother 1
who 1
was 1
stirring 1
a 1
pot 1
of 1
boiling 1
water 1
over 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
said 1
Mother 1
brother 1
is 1
sitting 1
by 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
an 1
apple 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
he 1
looks 1
so 1
pale 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
asked 1
him 1
to 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
apple 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
answer 1
and 1
that 1
frightened 1
me 1
Go 1
to 1
him 1
again 1
said 1
her 1
mother 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
does 1
not 1
answer 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
box 1
on 1
the 1
ear 1
So 1
little 1
Marleen 1
went 1
and 1
said 1
Brother 1
give 1
me 1
that 1
apple 1
but 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
say 1
a 1
word 1
then 1
she 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
box 1
on 1
the 1
ear 1
and 1
his 1
head 1
rolled 1
off 1
She 1
was 1
so 1
terrified 1
at 1
this 1
that 1
she 1
ran 1
crying 1
and 1
screaming 1
to 1
her 1
mother 1
Oh 1
she 1
said 1
I 1
have 1
knocked 1
off 1
brother 1
s 1
head 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
wept 1
and 1
wept 1
and 1
nothing 1
would 1
stop 1
her 1
What 1
have 1
you 1
done 1
said 1
her 1
mother 1
but 1
no 1
one 1
must 1
know 1
about 1
it 1
so 1
you 1
must 1
keep 1
silence 1
what 1
is 1
done 1
can 1
t 1
be 1
undone 1
we 1
will 1
make 1
him 1
into 1
puddings 1
And 1
she 1
took 1
the 1
little 1
boy 1
and 1
cut 1
him 1
up 1
made 1
him 1
into 1
puddings 1
and 1
put 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
pot 1
But 1
Marleen 1
stood 1
looking 1
on 1
and 1
wept 1
and 1
wept 1
and 1
her 1
tears 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
pot 1
so 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
need 1
of 1
salt 1
Presently 1
the 1
father 1
came 1
home 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
his 1
dinner 1
he 1
asked 1
Where 1
is 1
my 1
son 1
The 1
mother 1
said 1
nothing 1
but 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
large 1
dish 1
of 1
black 1
pudding 1
and 1
Marleen 1
still 1
wept 1
without 1
ceasing 1
The 1
father 1
again 1
asked 1
Where 1
is 1
my 1
son 1
Oh 1
answered 1
the 1
wife 1
he 1
is 1
gone 1
into 1
the 1
country 1
to 1
his 1
mother 1
s 1
great 1
uncle 1
he 1
is 1
going 1
to 1
stay 1
there 1
some 1
time 1
What 1
has 1
he 1
gone 1
there 1
for 1
and 1
he 1
never 1
even 1
said 1
goodbye 1
to 1
me 1
Well 1
he 1
likes 1
being 1
there 1
and 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
away 1
quite 1
six 1
weeks 1
he 1
is 1
well 1
looked 1
after 1
there 1
I 1
feel 1
very 1
unhappy 1
about 1
it 1
said 1
the 1
husband 1
in 1
case 1
it 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
he 1
ought 1
to 1
have 1
said 1
goodbye 1
to 1
me 1
With 1
this 1
he 1
went 1
on 1
with 1
his 1
dinner 1
and 1
said 1
Little 1
Marleen 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
weep 1
Brother 1
will 1
soon 1
be 1
back 1
Then 1
he 1
asked 1
his 1
wife 1
for 1
more 1
pudding 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
ate 1
he 1
threw 1
the 1
bones 1
under 1
the 1
table 1
Little 1
Marleen 1
went 1
upstairs 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
best 1
silk 1
handkerchief 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
bottom 1
drawer 1
and 1
in 1
it 1
she 1
wrapped 1
all 1
the 1
bones 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
carried 1
them 1
outside 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
she 1
did 1
nothing 1
but 1
weep 1
Then 1
she 1
laid 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
green 1
grass 1
under 1
the 1
juniper 1
tree 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
sooner 1
done 1
so 1
then 1
all 1
her 1
sadness 1
seemed 1
to 1
leave 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
wept 1
no 1
more 1
And 1
now 1
the 1
juniper 1
tree 1
began 1
to 1
move 1
and 1
the 1
branches 1
waved 1
backwards 1
and 1
forwards 1
first 1
away 1
from 1
one 1
another 1
and 1
then 1
together 1
again 1
as 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
someone 1
clapping 1
their 1
hands 1
for 1
joy 1
After 1
this 1
a 1
mist 1
came 1
round 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
it 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
burning 1
as 1
of 1
fire 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
there 1
flew 1
a 1
beautiful 1
bird 1
that 1
rose 1
high 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
singing 1
magnificently 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
could 1
no 1
more 1
be 1
seen 1
the 1
juniper 1
tree 1
stood 1
there 1
as 1
before 1
and 1
the 1
silk 1
handkerchief 1
and 1
the 1
bones 1
were 1
gone 1
Little 1
Marleen 1
now 1
felt 1
as 1
lighthearted 1
and 1
happy 1
as 1
if 1
her 1
brother 1
were 1
still 1
alive 1
and 1
she 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
cheerfully 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
ate 1
The 1
bird 1
flew 1
away 1
and 1
alighted 1
on 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
a 1
goldsmith 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
sing 1
My 1
mother 1
killed 1
her 1
little 1
son 1
My 1
father 1
grieved 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
gone 1
My 1
sister 1
loved 1
me 1
best 1
of 1
all 1
She 1
laid 1
her 1
kerchief 1
over 1
me 1
And 1
took 1
my 1
bones 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
lie 1
Underneath 1
the 1
juniper 1
tree 1
Kywitt 2
what 1

I 1
The 1
goldsmith 1
was 1
in 1
his 1
workshop 1
making 1
a 1
gold 1
chain 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
song 1
of 1
the 1
bird 1
on 1
his 1
roof 1
He 1
thought 1
it 1
so 1
beautiful 1
that 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
ran 1
out 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
crossed 1
the 1
threshold 1
he 1
lost 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
slippers 1
But 1
he 1
ran 1
on 1
into 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
with 1
a 1
slipper 1
on 1
one 1
foot 1
and 1
a 1
sock 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
he 1
still 1
had 1
on 1
his 1
apron 1
and 1
still 1
held 1
the 1
gold 1
chain 1
and 1
the 1
pincers 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
stood 1
gazing 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
bird 1
while 1
the 1
sun 1
came 1
shining 1
brightly 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
street 1
Bird 1
he 1
said 1
how 1
beautifully 1
you 1
sing 1
Sing 1
me 1
that 1
song 1
again 1
Nay 1
said 1
the 1
bird 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
sing 1
twice 1
for 1
nothing 1
Give 1
that 1
gold 1
chain 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
sing 1
it 1
you 1
again 1
Here 1
is 1
the 1
chain 1
take 1
it 1
said 1
the 1
goldsmith 1
Only 1
sing 1
me 1
that 1
again 1
The 1
bird 1
flew 1
down 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
gold 1
chain 1
in 1
his 1
right 1
claw 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
alighted 1
again 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
goldsmith 1
and 1
sang 1
My 1
mother 1
killed 1
her 1
little 1
son 1
My 1
father 1
grieved 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
gone 1
My 1
sister 1
loved 1
me 1
best 1
of 1
all 1
She 1
laid 1
her 1
kerchief 1
over 1
me 1
And 1
took 1
my 1
bones 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
lie 1
Underneath 1
the 1
juniper 1
tree 1
Kywitt 2
what 1
a 1
beautiful 1
bird 1
am 1
I 1
Then 1
he 1
flew 1
away 1
and 1
settled 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
of 1
a 1
shoemaker 1
s 1
house 1
and 1
sang 1

The 1
shoemaker 1
heard 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
jumped 1
up 1
and 1
ran 1
out 1
in 1
his 1
shirt 1
sleeves 1
and 1
stood 1
looking 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
bird 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
with 1
his 1
hand 1
over 1
his 1
eyes 1
to 1
keep 1
himself 1
from 1
being 1
blinded 1
by 1
the 1
sun 1
Bird 1
he 1
said 1
how 1
beautifully 1
you 1
sing 1
Then 1
he 1
called 1
through 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1
Wife 1

and 1

at 1

and 1

how 1
beautifully 1

Then 1
he 1
called 1
his 1
daughter 1
and 1
the 1
children 1
then 1
the 1
apprentices 1
girls 1
and 1
boys 1
and 1
they 1
all 1
ran 1
up 1
the 1
street 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
bird 1
and 1
saw 1
how 1
splendid 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
its 1
red 1
and 1
green 1
feathers 1
and 1
its 1
neck 1
like 1
burnished 1
gold 1
and 1
eyes 1
like 1
two 1
bright 1
stars 1
in 1
its 1
head 1
Bird 1
said 1
the 1
shoemaker 1
sing 1

that 1
song 1
again 1
Nay 1
answered 1
the 1
bird 1
I 1

for 1
nothing 1

me 1
something 1
Wife 1

the 1
man 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
garret 1
on 1
the 1
upper 1
shelf 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1

The 1
wife 1
went 1
in 1
and 1
fetched 1
the 1
shoes 1
There 1
bird 1
said 1
the 1
shoemaker 1
now 1
sing 1

The 1

then 1
he 1
looked 1
up 1
and 1
the 1
last 1
one 1
had 1
left 1
off 1
work 1
Bird 1
he 1
said 1
what 1
a 1
beautiful 1
song 1
that 1
is 1
you 1
sing 1
Let 1
me 1
hear 1
it 1
too 1
sing 1

Nay 1
answered 1
the 1

I 1
do 1
not 1
sing 1
twice 1
for 1
nothing 1
give 1
me 1
that 1
millstone 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
sing 1
it 1
again 1
If 1
it 1
belonged 1
to 1
me 1
alone 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
it 1
Yes 1
yes 1
said 1
the 1
others 1
if 1
he 1
will 1
sing 1
again 1
he 1
can 1
have 1
it 1
The 1
bird 1
came 1
down 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
twenty 1
millers 1
set 1
to 1
and 1
lifted 1
up 1
the 1
stone 1
with 1
a 1
beam 1
then 1
the 1
bird 1
put 1
his 1
head 1
through 1
the 1
hole 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
stone 1
round 1
his 1
neck 1
like 1
a 1
collar 1
and 1
flew 1
back 1
with 1
it 1
to 1
the 1

sang 1

And 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
finished 1
his 1
song 1
he 1
spread 1
his 1
wings 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
chain 1
in 1
his 1
right 1
claw 1
the 1
shoes 1
in 1
his 1
left 1
and 1
the 1
millstone 1
round 1
his 1
neck 1
he 1
flew 1
right 1
away 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
s 1
house 1
The 1
father 1
the 1
mother 1
and 1
little 1
Marleen 1
were 1
having 1
their 1
dinner 1
How 1
lighthearted 1
I 1
feel 1
said 1
the 1
father 1
so 1
pleased 1
and 1
cheerful 1
And 1
I 1
said 1
the 1
mother 1
I 1
feel 1
so 1
uneasy 1
as 1
if 1
a 1
heavy 1
thunderstorm 1
were 1
coming 1
But 1
little 1
Marleen 1
sat 1
and 1
wept 1
and 1
wept 1
Then 1
the 1
bird 1
came 1
flying 1
towards 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
settled 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
I 1
do 1
feel 1
so 1
happy 1
said 1
the 1
father 1
and 1
how 1
beautifully 1
the 1
sun 1
shines 1
I 1
feel 1
just 1
as 1
if 1
I 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
see 1
an 1
old 1
friend 1
again 1
Ah 1
said 1
the 1
wife 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
full 1
of 1
distress 1
and 1
uneasiness 1
that 1
my 1
teeth 1
chatter 1
and 1
I 1
feel 1
as 1
if 1
there 1
were 1
a 1
fire 1
in 1
my 1
veins 1
and 1
she 1
tore 1
open 1
her 1
dress 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
while 1
little 1
Marleen 1
sat 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
and 1
wept 1
and 1
the 1
plate 1
on 1
her 1
knees 1
was 1
wet 1
with 1
her 1
tears 1
The 1
bird 1
now 1
flew 1
to 1
the 1
juniper 1
tree 1
and 1
began 1
singing 1
My 1
mother 1
killed 1
her 1
little 1
son 1
the 1
mother 1
shut 1
her 1
eyes 1
and 1
her 1
ears 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
see 1
and 1
hear 1
nothing 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
roaring 1
sound 1
in 1
her 1
ears 1
like 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
violent 1
storm 1
and 1
in 1
her 1
eyes 1
a 1
burning 1
and 1
flashing 1
like 1
lightning 1
My 1
father 1
grieved 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
gone 1
Look 1
mother 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
at 1
the 1
beautiful 1
bird 1
that 1
is 1
singing 1
so 1
magnificently 1
and 1
how 1
warm 1
and 1
bright 1
the 1
sun 1
is 1
and 1
what 1
a 1
delicious 1
scent 1
of 1
spice 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
My 1
sister 1
loved 1
me 1
best 1
of 1
all 1
then 1
little 1
Marleen 1
laid 1
her 1
head 1
down 1
on 1
her 1
knees 1
and 1
sobbed 1
I 1
must 1
go 1
outside 1
and 1
see 1
the 1
bird 1
nearer 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
Ah 1
do 1
not 1
go 1
cried 1
the 1
wife 1
I 1
feel 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
whole 1
house 1
were 1
in 1
flames 1
But 1
the 1
man 1
went 1
out 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
bird 1
She 1
laid 1
her 1
kerchief 1
over 1
me 1
And 1
took 1
my 1
bones 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
lie 1
Underneath 1
the 1
juniper 1
tree 1
Kywitt 2
what 1
a 1
beautiful 1
bird 1
am 1
I 1
With 1
that 1
the 1
bird 1
let 1
fall 1
the 1
gold 1
chain 1
and 1
it 1
fell 1
just 1
round 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
neck 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
fitted 1
him 1
exactly 1
He 1
went 1
inside 1
and 1
said 1
See 1
what 1
a 1
splendid 1
bird 1
that 1
is 1
he 1
has 1
given 1
me 1
this 1
beautiful 1
gold 1
chain 1
and 1
looks 1
so 1
beautiful 1
himself 1
But 1
the 1
wife 1
was 1
in 1
such 1
fear 1
and 1
trouble 1
that 1
she 1
fell 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
her 1
cap 1
fell 1
from 1
her 1
head 1
Then 1
the 1
bird 1
began 1
again 1
My 1
mother 1
killed 1
her 1
little 1
son 1
Ah 1
me 1
cried 1
the 1
wife 1
if 1
I 1
were 1
but 1
a 1
thousand 1
feet 1
beneath 1
the 1
earth 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
not 1
hear 1
that 1
song 1
My 1
father 1
grieved 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
gone 1
then 1
the 1
woman 1
fell 1
down 1
again 1
as 1
if 1
dead 1
My 1
sister 1
loved 1
me 1
best 1
of 1
all 1
Well 1
said 1
little 1
Marleen 1
I 1
will 1
go 1
out 1
too 1
and 1
see 1
if 1
the 1
bird 1
will 1
give 1
me 1
anything 1
So 1
she 1
went 1
out 1
She 1
laid 1
her 1
kerchief 1
over 1
me 1
And 1
took 1
my 1
bones 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
lie 1
and 1
he 1
threw 1
down 1
the 1
shoes 1
to 1
her 1
Underneath 1
the 1
juniper 1
tree 1
Kywitt 2
what 1
a 1
beautiful 1
bird 1
am 1
I 1
And 1
she 1
now 1
felt 1
quite 1
happy 1
and 1
lighthearted 1
she 1
put 1
on 1
the 1
shoes 1
and 1
danced 1
and 1
jumped 1
about 1
in 1
them 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
miserable 1
she 1
said 1
when 1
I 1
came 1
out 1
but 1
that 1
has 1
all 1
passed 1
away 1
that 1
is 1
indeed 1
a 1
splendid 1
bird 1
and 1
he 1
has 1
given 1
me 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
red 1
shoes 1
The 1
wife 1
sprang 1
up 1
with 1
her 1
hair 1
standing 1
out 1
from 1
her 1
head 1
like 1
flames 1
of 1
fire 1
Then 1
I 1
will 1
go 1
out 1
too 1
she 1
said 1
and 1
see 1
if 1
it 1
will 1
lighten 1
my 1
misery 1
for 1
I 1
feel 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
world 1
were 1
coming 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
But 1
as 1
she 1
crossed 1
the 1
threshold 1
crash 1
the 1
bird 1
threw 1
the 1
millstone 1
down 1
on 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
crushed 1
to 1
death 1
The 1
father 1
and 1
little 1
Marleen 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
and 1
ran 1
out 1
but 1
they 1
only 1
saw 1
mist 1
and 1
flame 1
and 1
fire 1
rising 1
from 1
the 1
spot 1
and 1
when 1
these 1
had 1
passed 1
there 1
stood 1
the 1
little 1
brother 1
and 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
father 1
and 1
little 1
Marleen 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
then 1
they 1
all 1
three 1
rejoiced 1
and 1
went 1
inside 1
together 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
their 1
dinners 1
and 1
ate 1
THE 1
TURNIP 1
There 1
were 1
two 1
brothers 1
who 1
were 1
both 1
soldiers 1
the 1
one 1
was 1
rich 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
poor 1
The 1
poor 1
man 1
thought 1
he 1
would 1
try 1
to 1
better 1
himself 1
so 1
pulling 1
off 1
his 1
red 1
coat 1
he 1
became 1
a 1
gardener 1
and 1
dug 1
his 1
ground 1
well 1
and 1
sowed 1
turnips 1
When 1
the 1
seed 1
came 1
up 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
plant 1
bigger 1
than 1
all 1
the 1
rest 1
and 1
it 1
kept 1
getting 1
larger 1
and 1
larger 1
and 1
seemed 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
would 1
never 1
cease 1
growing 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
called 1
the 1
prince 1
of 1
turnips 1
for 1
there 1
never 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
one 1
seen 1
before 1
and 1
never 1
will 1
again 1
At 1
last 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
big 1
that 1
it 1
filled 1
a 1
cart 1
and 1
two 1
oxen 1
could 1
hardly 1
draw 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
gardener 1
knew 1
not 1
what 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
nor 1
whether 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
blessing 1
or 1
a 1
curse 1
to 1
him 1
One 1
day 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
What 1
shall 1
I 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
if 1
I 1
sell 1
it 2
will 1
bring 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
another 1
and 1
for 1
eating 1
the 1
little 1
turnips 1
are 1
better 1
than 1
this 1
the 1
best 1
thing 1
perhaps 1
is 1
to 1
carry 1
it 1
and 1
give 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
as 1
a 1
mark 1
of 1
respect 1
Then 1
he 1
yoked 1
his 1
oxen 1
and 1
drew 1
the 1
turnip 1
to 1
the 1
court 1
and 1
gave 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
What 1
a 1
wonderful 1
thing 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
many 1
strange 1
things 1
but 1
such 1
a 1
monster 1
as 1
this 1
I 1
never 1
saw 1
Where 1
did 1
you 1
get 1
the 1
seed 1
or 1
is 1
it 1
only 1
your 1
good 1
luck 1
If 1
so 1
you 1
are 1
a 1
true 1
child 1
of 1
fortune 1
Ah 1
no 1
answered 1
the 1
gardener 1
I 1
am 1
no 1
child 1
of 1
fortune 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
poor 1
soldier 1
who 1
never 1
could 1
get 1
enough 1
to 1
live 1
upon 1
so 1
I 1
laid 1
aside 1
my 1
red 1
coat 1
and 1
set 1
to 1
work 1
tilling 1
the 1
ground 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
brother 1
who 1
is 1
rich 1
and 1
your 1
majesty 1
knows 1
him 1
well 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
world 1
knows 1
him 1
but 1
because 1
I 1
am 1
poor 1
everybody 1
forgets 1
me 1
The 1
king 1
then 1
took 1
pity 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
You 1
shall 1
be 1
poor 1
no 1
longer 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
you 1
shall 1
be 1
even 1
richer 1
than 1
your 1
brother 1
Then 1
he 1
gave 1
him 1
gold 1
and 1
lands 1
and 1
flocks 1
and 1
made 1
him 1
so 1
rich 1
that 1
his 1
brother 1
s 1
fortune 1
could 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
be 1
compared 1
with 1
his 1
When 1
the 1
brother 1
heard 1
of 1
all 1
this 1
and 1
how 1
a 1
turnip 1
had 1
made 1
the 1
gardener 1
so 1
rich 1
he 1
envied 1
him 1
sorely 1
and 1
bethought 1
himself 1
how 1
he 1
could 1
contrive 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
same 1
good 1
fortune 1
for 1
himself 1
However 1
he 1
determined 1
to 1
manage 1
more 1
cleverly 1
than 1
his 1
brother 1
and 1
got 1
together 1
a 1
rich 1
present 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
fine 1
horses 1
for 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
thought 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
a 1
much 1
larger 1
gift 1
in 1
return 1
for 1
if 1
his 1
brother 1
had 1
received 1
so 1
much 1
for 1
only 1
a 1
turnip 1
what 1
must 1
his 1
present 1
be 1
worth 1
The 1
king 1
took 1
the 1
gift 1
very 1
graciously 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
knew 1
not 1
what 1
to 1
give 1
in 1
return 1
more 1
valuable 1
and 1
wonderful 1
than 1
the 1
great 1
turnip 1
so 1
the 1
soldier 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
a 1
cart 1
and 1
drag 1
it 1
home 1
with 1
him 1
When 1
he 1
reached 1
home 1
he 1
knew 1
not 1
upon 1
whom 1
to 1
vent 1
his 1
rage 1
and 1
spite 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
wicked 1
thoughts 1
came 1
into 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
he 1
resolved 1
to 1
kill 1
his 1
brother 1
So 1
he 1
hired 1
some 1
villains 1
to 1
murder 1
him 1
and 1
having 1
shown 1
them 1
where 1
to 1
lie 1
in 1
ambush 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
his 1
brother 1
and 1
said 1
Dear 1
brother 1
I 1
have 1
found 1
a 1
hidden 1
treasure 1
let 1
us 1
go 1
and 1
dig 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
share 1
it 1
between 1
us 1
The 1
other 1
had 1
no 1
suspicions 1
of 1
his 1
roguery 1
so 1
they 1
went 1
out 1
together 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
travelling 1
along 1
the 1
murderers 1
rushed 1
out 1
upon 1
him 1
bound 1
him 1
and 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
hang 1
him 1
on 1
a 1
tree 1
But 1
whilst 1
they 1
were 1
getting 1
all 1
ready 1
they 1
heard 1
the 1
trampling 1
of 1
a 1
horse 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
which 1
so 1
frightened 1
them 1
that 1
they 1
pushed 1
their 1
prisoner 1
neck 1
and 1
shoulders 1
together 1
into 1
a 1
sack 1
and 1
swung 1
him 1
up 1
by 1
a 1
cord 1
to 1
the 1
tree 1
where 1
they 1
left 1
him 1
dangling 1
and 1
ran 1
away 1
Meantime 1
he 1
worked 1
and 1
worked 1
away 1
till 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
hole 1
large 1
enough 1
to 1
put 1
out 1
his 1
head 1
When 1
the 1
horseman 1
came 1
up 1
he 1
proved 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
student 1
a 1
merry 1
fellow 1
who 1
was 1
journeying 1
along 1
on 1
his 1
nag 1
and 1
singing 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
sack 1
saw 1
him 1
passing 1
under 1
the 1
tree 1
he 1
cried 1
out 1
Good 1
morning 1
good 1
morning 1
to 1
thee 1
my 1
friend 1
The 1
student 1
looked 1
about 1
everywhere 1
and 1
seeing 1
no 1
one 1
and 1
not 1
knowing 1
where 1
the 1
voice 1
came 1
from 1
cried 1
out 1
Who 1
calls 1
me 1
Then 1
the 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
tree 1
answered 1
Lift 1
up 1
thine 1
eyes 1
for 1
behold 1
here 1
I 1
sit 1
in 1
the 1
sack 1
of 1
wisdom 1
here 1
have 1
I 1
in 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
learned 1
great 1
and 1
wondrous 1
things 1
Compared 1
to 1
this 1
seat 1
all 1
the 1
learning 1
of 1
the 1
schools 1
is 1
as 1
empty 1
air 1
A 1
little 1
longer 1
and 1
I 1
shall 1
know 1
all 1
that 1
man 1
can 1
know 1
and 1
shall 1
come 1
forth 1
wiser 1
than 1
the 1
wisest 1
of 1
mankind 1
Here 1
I 1
discern 1
the 1
signs 1
and 1
motions 1
of 1
the 1
heavens 1
and 1
the 1
stars 1
the 1
laws 1
that 1
control 1
the 1
winds 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
the 1
sands 1
on 1
the 1
seashore 1
the 1
healing 1
of 1
the 1
sick 1
the 1
virtues 1
of 1
all 1
simples 1
of 1
birds 1
and 1
of 1
precious 1
stones 1
Wert 1
thou 1
but 1
once 1
here 1
my 1
friend 1
though 1
wouldst 1
feel 1
and 1
own 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
knowledge 1
The 1
student 1
listened 1
to 1
all 1
this 1
and 1
wondered 1
much 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
said 1
Blessed 1
be 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
hour 1
when 1
I 1
found 1
you 1
cannot 1
you 1
contrive 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
into 1
the 1
sack 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
Then 1
the 1
other 1
answered 1
as 1
if 1
very 1
unwillingly 1
A 1
little 1
space 1
I 1
may 1
allow 1
thee 1
to 1
sit 1
here 1
if 1
thou 1
wilt 1
reward 1
me 1
well 1
and 1
entreat 1
me 1
kindly 1
but 1
thou 1
must 1
tarry 1
yet 1
an 1
hour 1
below 1
till 1
I 1
have 1
learnt 1
some 1
little 1
matters 1
that 1
are 1
yet 1
unknown 1
to 1
me 1
So 1
the 1
student 1
sat 1
himself 1
down 1
and 1
waited 1
a 1
while 1
but 1
the 1
time 1
hung 1
heavy 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
begged 1
earnestly 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
ascend 1
forthwith 1
for 1
his 1
thirst 1
for 1
knowledge 1
was 1
great 1
Then 1
the 1
other 1
pretended 1
to 1
give 1
way 1
and 1
said 1
Thou 1
must 1
let 1
the 1
sack 1
of 1
wisdom 1
descend 1
by 1
untying 1
yonder 1
cord 1
and 1
then 1
thou 1
shalt 1
enter 1
So 1
the 1
student 1
let 1
him 1
down 1
opened 1
the 1
sack 1
and 1
set 1
him 1
free 1
Now 1
then 1
cried 1
he 1
let 1
me 1
ascend 1
quickly 1
As 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
put 1
himself 1
into 1
the 1
sack 1
heels 1
first 1
Wait 1
a 1
while 1
said 1
the 1
gardener 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
way 1
Then 1
he 1
pushed 1
him 1
in 1
head 1
first 1
tied 1
up 1
the 1
sack 1
and 1
soon 1
swung 1
up 1
the 1
searcher 1
after 1
wisdom 1
dangling 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
How 1
is 1
it 1
with 1
thee 1
friend 1
said 1
he 1
dost 1
thou 1
not 1
feel 1
that 1
wisdom 1
comes 1
unto 1
thee 1
Rest 1
there 1
in 1
peace 1
till 1
thou 1
art 1
a 1
wiser 1
man 1
than 1
thou 1
wert 1
So 1
saying 1
he 1
trotted 1
off 1
on 1
the 1
student 1
s 1
nag 1
and 1
left 1
the 1
poor 1
fellow 1
to 1
gather 1
wisdom 1
till 1
somebody 1
should 1
come 1
and 1
let 1
him 1
down 1

s 1

threw 1

Then 1
Gretel 1
became 1
angry 1

THE 1
THREE 1
LANGUAGES 1
An 1
aged 1
count 1
once 1
lived 1
in 1
Switzerland 1
who 1
had 1
an 1
only 1
son 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
stupid 1
and 1
could 1
learn 1
nothing 1
Then 1
said 1
the 1
father 1
Hark 1
you 1
my 1
son 1
try 1
as 1
I 1
will 1
I 1
can 1
get 1
nothing 1
into 1
your 1
head 1
You 1
must 1
go 1
from 1
hence 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
into 1
the 1
care 1
of 1
a 1
celebrated 1
master 1
who 1
shall 1
see 1
what 1
he 1
can 1
do 1
with 1
you 1
The 1
youth 1
was 1
sent 1
into 1
a 1
strange 1
town 1
and 1
remained 1
a 1
whole 1
year 1
with 1
the 1
master 1
At 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
this 1
time 1
he 1
came 1
home 1
again 1
and 1
his 1
father 1
asked 1
Now 1
my 1
son 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
learnt 1
Father 1
I 1
have 1
learnt 1
what 1
the 1
dogs 1
say 1
when 1
they 1
bark 1
Lord 1
have 1
mercy 1
on 1
us 1
cried 1
the 1
father 1
is 1
that 1
all 1
you 1
have 1
learnt 1
I 1
will 1
send 1
you 1
into 1
another 1
town 1
to 1
another 1
master 1
The 1
youth 1
was 1
taken 1
thither 1
and 1
stayed 1
a 1
year 1
with 1
this 1
master 1
likewise 1
When 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
the 1
father 1
again 1
asked 1
My 1
son 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
learnt 1
He 1
answered 1
Father 1
I 1
have 1
learnt 1
what 1
the 1
birds 1
say 1
Then 1
the 1
father 1
fell 1
into 1
a 1
rage 1
and 1
said 1
Oh 1
you 1
lost 1
man 1
you 1
have 1
spent 1
the 1
precious 1
time 1
and 1
learnt 1
nothing 1
are 1
you 1
not 1
ashamed 1
to 1
appear 1
before 1
my 1
eyes 1
I 1
will 1
send 1
you 1
to 1
a 1
third 1
master 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
learn 1
nothing 1
this 1
time 1
also 1
I 1
will 1
no 1
longer 1
be 1
your 1
father 1
The 1
youth 1
remained 1
a 1
whole 1
year 1
with 1
the 1
third 1
master 1
also 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
home 1
again 1
and 1
his 1
father 1
inquired 1
My 1
son 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
learnt 1
he 1
answered 1
Dear 1
father 1
I 1
have 1
this 1
year 1
learnt 1
what 1
the 1
frogs 1
croak 1
Then 1
the 1
father 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
most 1
furious 1
anger 1
sprang 1
up 1
called 1
his 1
people 1
thither 1
and 1
said 1
This 1
man 1
is 1
no 1
longer 1
my 1
son 1
I 1
drive 1
him 1
forth 1
and 1
command 1
you 1
to 1
take 1
him 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
kill 1
him 1
They 1
took 1
him 1
forth 1
but 1
when 1
they 1
should 1
have 1
killed 1
him 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
for 1
pity 1
and 1
let 1
him 1
go 1
and 1
they 1
cut 1
the 1
eyes 1
and 1
tongue 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
deer 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
carry 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
as 1
a 1
token 1
The 1
youth 1
wandered 1
on 1
and 1
after 1
some 1
time 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
fortress 1
where 1
he 1
begged 1
for 1
a 1
night 1
s 1
lodging 1
Yes 1
said 1
the 1
lord 1
of 1
the 1
castle 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
pass 1
the 1
night 1
down 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
tower 1
go 1
thither 1
but 1
I 1
warn 1
you 1
it 1
is 1
at 1
the 1
peril 1
of 1
your 1
life 1
for 1
it 1
is 1
full 1
of 1
wild 1
dogs 1
which 1
bark 1
and 1
howl 1
without 1
stopping 1
and 1
at 1
certain 1
hours 1
a 1
man 1
has 1
to 1
be 1
given 1
to 1
them 1
whom 1
they 1
at 1
once 1
devour 1
The 1
whole 1
district 1
was 1
in 1
sorrow 1
and 1
dismay 1
because 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
yet 1
no 1
one 1
could 1
do 1
anything 1
to 1
stop 1
this 1
The 1
youth 1
however 1
was 1
without 1
fear 1
and 1
said 1
Just 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
barking 1
dogs 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
something 1
that 1
I 1
can 1
throw 1
to 1
them 1
they 1
will 1
do 1
nothing 1
to 1
harm 1
me 1
As 1
he 1
himself 1
would 1
have 1
it 1
so 1
they 1
gave 1
him 1
some 1
food 1
for 1
the 1
wild 1
animals 1
and 1
led 1
him 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
tower 1
When 1
he 1
went 1
inside 1
the 1
dogs 1
did 1
not 1
bark 1
at 1
him 1
but 1
wagged 1
their 1
tails 1
quite 1
amicably 1
around 1
him 1
ate 1
what 1
he 1
set 1
before 1
them 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
hurt 1
one 1
hair 1
of 1
his 1
head 1
Next 1
morning 1
to 1
the 1
astonishment 1
of 1
everyone 1
he 1
came 1
out 1
again 1
safe 1
and 1
unharmed 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
lord 1
of 1
the 1
castle 1
The 1
dogs 1
have 1
revealed 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
their 1
own 1
language 1
why 1
they 1
dwell 1
there 1
and 1
bring 1
evil 1
on 1
the 1
land 1
They 1
are 1
bewitched 1
and 1
are 1
obliged 1
to 1
watch 1
over 1
a 1
great 1
treasure 1
which 1
is 1
below 1
in 1
the 1
tower 1
and 1
they 1
can 1
have 1
no 1
rest 1
until 1
it 1
is 1
taken 1
away 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
likewise 1
learnt 1
from 1
their 1
discourse 1
how 1
that 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
Then 1
all 1
who 1
heard 1
this 1
rejoiced 1
and 1
the 1
lord 1
of 1
the 1
castle 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
adopt 1
him 1
as 1
a 1
son 1
if 1
he 1
accomplished 1
it 1
successfully 1
He 1
went 1
down 1
again 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
knew 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
he 1
did 1
it 1
thoroughly 1
and 1
brought 1
a 1
chest 1
full 1
of 1
gold 1
out 1
with 1
him 1
The 1
howling 1
of 1
the 1
wild 1
dogs 1
was 1
henceforth 1
heard 1
no 1
more 1
they 1
had 1
disappeared 1
and 1
the 1
country 1
was 1
freed 1
from 1
the 1
trouble 1
After 1
some 1
time 1
he 1
took 1
it 1
in 1
his 1
head 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
travel 1
to 1
Rome 1
On 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
passed 1
by 1
a 1
marsh 1
in 1
which 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
frogs 1
were 1
sitting 1
croaking 1
He 1
listened 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
became 1
aware 1
of 1
what 1
they 1
were 1
saying 1
he 1
grew 1
very 1
thoughtful 1
and 1
sad 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
arrived 1
in 1
Rome 1
where 1
the 1
Pope 1
had 1
just 1
died 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
great 1
doubt 1
among 1
the 1
cardinals 1
as 1
to 1
whom 1
they 1
should 1
appoint 1
as 1
his 1
successor 1
They 1
at 1
length 1
agreed 1
that 1
the 1
person 1
should 1
be 1
chosen 1
as 1
pope 1
who 1
should 1
be 1
distinguished 1
by 1
some 1
divine 1
and 1
miraculous 1
token 1
And 1
just 1
as 1
that 1
was 1
decided 1
on 1
the 1
young 1
count 1
entered 1
into 1
the 1
church 1
and 1
suddenly 1
two 1
snow 1
white 1
doves 1
flew 1
on 1
his 1
shoulders 1
and 1
remained 1
sitting 1
there 1
The 1
ecclesiastics 1
recognized 1
therein 1
the 1
token 1
from 1
above 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
spot 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
pope 1
He 1
was 1
undecided 1
and 1
knew 1
not 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
worthy 1
of 1
this 1
but 1
the 1
doves 1
counselled 1
him 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
he 1
said 1
yes 1
Then 1
was 1
he 1
anointed 1
and 1
consecrated 1
and 1
thus 1
was 1
fulfilled 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
from 1
the 1
frogs 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
which 1
had 1
so 1
affected 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
his 1
Holiness 1
the 1
Pope 1
Then 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
sing 1
a 1
mass 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
one 1
word 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
two 1
doves 1
sat 1
continually 1
on 1
his 1
shoulders 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
all 1
in 1
his 1
ear 1
THE 1
FOX 1
AND 1
THE 1
CAT 1
It 1
happened 1
that 1
the 1
cat 1
met 1
the 1
fox 1
in 1
a 1
forest 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
thought 1
to 1
herself 1
He 1
is 1
clever 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
experience 1
and 1
much 1
esteemed 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
she 1
spoke 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
friendly 1
way 1
Good 1
day 1
dear 1
Mr 1
Fox 1
how 1
are 1
you 1
How 1
is 1
all 1
with 1
you 1
How 1
are 1
you 1
getting 1
on 1
in 1
these 1
hard 1
times 1
The 1
fox 1
full 1
of 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
arrogance 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
cat 1
from 1
head 1
to 1
foot 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
whether 1
he 1
would 1
give 1
any 1
answer 1
or 1
not 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
said 1
Oh 1
you 1
wretched 1
beard 1
cleaner 1
you 1
piebald 1
fool 1
you 1
hungry 1
mouse 1
hunter 1
what 1
can 1
you 1
be 1
thinking 1
of 1
Have 1
you 1
the 1
cheek 1
to 1
ask 1
how 1
I 1
am 1
getting 1
on 1
What 1
have 1
you 1
learnt 1
How 1
many 1
arts 1
do 1
you 1
understand 1
I 1
understand 1
but 1
one 1
replied 1
the 1
cat 1
modestly 1
What 1
art 1
is 1
that 1
asked 1
the 1
fox 1
When 1
the 1
hounds 1
are 1
following 1
me 1
I 1
can 1
spring 1
into 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
save 1
myself 1
Is 1
that 1
all 1
said 1
the 1
fox 1
I 1
am 1
master 1
of 1
a 1
hundred 1
arts 1
and 1
have 1
into 1
the 1
bargain 1
a 1
sackful 1
of 1
cunning 1
You 1
make 1
me 1
sorry 1
for 1
you 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
I 1
will 1
teach 1
you 1
how 1
people 1
get 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
hounds 1
Just 1
then 1
came 1
a 1
hunter 1
with 1
four 1
dogs 1
The 1
cat 1
sprang 1
nimbly 1
up 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
it 1
where 1
the 1
branches 1
and 1
foliage 1
quite 1
concealed 1
her 1
Open 1
your 1
sack 1
Mr 1
Fox 1
open 1
your 1
sack 1
cried 1
the 1
cat 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
the 1
dogs 1
had 1
already 1
seized 1
him 1
and 1
were 1
holding 1
him 1
fast 1
Ah 1
Mr 1
Fox 1
cried 1
the 1
cat 1
You 1
with 1
your 1
hundred 1
arts 1
are 1
left 1
in 1
the 1
lurch 1
Had 1
you 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
climb 1
like 1
me 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
lost 1
your 1
life 1
THE 1
FOUR 1
CLEVER 1
BROTHERS 1
Dear 1
children 1
said 1
a 1
poor 1
man 1
to 1
his 1
four 1
sons 1
I 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
give 1
you 2
must 1
go 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
wide 1
world 1
and 1
try 1
your 1
luck 1
Begin 1
by 1
learning 1
some 1
craft 1
or 1
another 1
and 1
see 1
how 1
you 1
can 1
get 1
on 1
So 1
the 1
four 1
brothers 1
took 1
their 1
walking 1
sticks 1
in 1
their 1
hands 1
and 1
their 1
little 1
bundles 1
on 1
their 1
shoulders 1
and 1
after 1
bidding 1
their 1
father 1
goodbye 1
went 1
all 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
gate 1
together 1
When 1
they 1
had 1
got 1
on 1
some 1
way 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
four 1
crossways 1
each 1
leading 1
to 1
a 1
different 1
country 1
Then 1
the 1
eldest 1
said 1
Here 1
we 1
must 1
part 1
but 1
this 1
day 1
four 1
years 1
we 1
will 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
this 1
spot 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
each 1
must 1
try 1
what 1
he 1
can 1
do 1
for 1
himself 1
So 1
each 1
brother 1
went 1
his 1
way 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
eldest 1
was 1
hastening 1
on 1
a 1
man 1
met 1
him 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
and 1
what 1
he 1
wanted 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
try 1
my 1
luck 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
begin 1
by 1
learning 1
some 1
art 1
or 1
trade 1
answered 1
he 1
Then 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
go 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
teach 1
you 1
to 1
become 1
the 1
cunningest 1
thief 1
that 1
ever 1
was 1
No 1
said 1
the 1
other 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
an 1
honest 1
calling 1
and 1
what 1
can 1
one 1
look 1
to 1
earn 1
by 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
end 1
but 1
the 1
gallows 1
Oh 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
you 1
need 1
not 1
fear 1
the 1
gallows 1
for 1
I 1
will 1
only 1
teach 1
you 1
to 1
steal 1
what 1
will 1
be 1
fair 1
game 1
I 1
meddle 1
with 1
nothing 1
but 1
what 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
can 1
get 1
or 1
care 1
anything 1
about 1
and 1
where 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
find 1
you 1
out 1
So 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
agreed 1
to 1
follow 1
his 1
trade 1
and 1
he 1
soon 1
showed 1
himself 1
so 1
clever 1
that 1
nothing 1
could 1
escape 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
once 1
set 1
his 1
mind 1
upon 1
The 1
second 1
brother 1
also 1
met 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
when 1
he 1
found 1
out 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
setting 1
out 1
upon 1
asked 1
him 1
what 1
craft 1
he 1
meant 1
to 1
follow 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
yet 1
said 1
he 1
Then 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
be 1
a 1
star 1
gazer 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
noble 1
art 1
for 1
nothing 1
can 1
be 1
hidden 1
from 1
you 1
when 1
once 1
you 1
understand 1
the 1
stars 1
The 1
plan 1
pleased 1
him 1
much 1
and 1
he 1
soon 1
became 1
such 1
a 1
skilful 1
star 1
gazer 1
that 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
served 1
out 1
his 1
time 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
leave 1
his 1
master 1
he 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
glass 1
and 1
said 1
With 1
this 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
passing 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
and 1
on 1
earth 1
and 1
nothing 1
can 1
be 1
hidden 1
from 1
you 1
The 1
third 1
brother 1
met 1
a 1
huntsman 1
who 1
took 1
him 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
taught 1
him 1
so 1
well 1
all 1
that 1
belonged 1
to 1
hunting 1
that 1
he 1
became 1
very 1
clever 1
in 1
the 1
craft 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
left 1
his 1
master 1
he 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
bow 1
and 1
said 1
Whatever 1
you 1
shoot 1
at 1
with 1
this 1
bow 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
sure 1
to 1
hit 1
The 1
youngest 1
brother 1
likewise 1
met 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
asked 1
him 1
what 1
he 1
wished 1
to 1
do 1
Would 1
not 1
you 1
like 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
tailor 1
Oh 1
no 1
said 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
sitting 1
cross 1
legged 1
from 1
morning 1
to 1
night 1
working 1
backwards 1
and 1
forwards 1
with 1
a 1
needle 1
and 1
goose 1
will 1
never 1
suit 1
me 1
Oh 1
answered 1
the 1
man 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
my 1
sort 1
of 1
tailoring 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
learn 1
quite 1
another 1
kind 1
of 1
craft 1
from 1
that 1
Not 1
knowing 1
what 1
better 1
to 1
do 1
he 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
plan 1
and 1
learnt 1
tailoring 1
from 1
the 1
beginning 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
left 1
his 1
master 1
he 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
needle 1
and 1
said 1
You 1
can 1
sew 1
anything 1
with 1
this 1
be 1
it 1
as 1
soft 1
as 1
an 1
egg 1
or 1
as 1
hard 1
as 1
steel 1
and 1
the 1
joint 1
will 1
be 1
so 1
fine 1
that 1
no 1
seam 1
will 1
be 1
seen 1
After 1
the 1
space 1
of 1
four 1
years 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
agreed 1
upon 1
the 1
four 1
brothers 1
met 1
at 1
the 1
four 1
cross 1
roads 1
and 1
having 1
welcomed 1
each 1
other 1
set 1
off 1
towards 1
their 1
father 1
s 1
home 1
where 1
they 1
told 1
him 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
happened 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
how 1
each 1
had 1
learned 1
some 1
craft 1
Then 1
one 1
day 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
sitting 1
before 1
the 1
house 1
under 1
a 1
very 1
high 1
tree 1
the 1
father 1
said 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
try 1
what 1
each 1
of 1
you 1
can 1
do 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
So 1
he 1
looked 1
up 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
second 1
son 1
At 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
this 1
tree 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
chaffinch 1
s 1
nest 1
tell 1
me 1
how 1
many 1
eggs 1
there 1
are 1
in 1
it 1
The 1
star 1
gazer 1
took 1
his 1
glass 1
looked 1
up 1
and 1
said 1
Five 1
Now 1
said 1
the 1
father 1
to 1
the 1
eldest 1
son 1
take 1
away 1
the 1
eggs 1
without 1
letting 1
the 1
bird 1
that 1
is 1
sitting 1
upon 1
them 1
and 1
hatching 1
them 1
know 1
anything 1
of 1
what 1
you 1
are 1
doing 1
So 1
the 1
cunning 1
thief 1
climbed 1
up 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
brought 1
away 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
the 1
five 1
eggs 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
bird 1
and 1
it 1
never 1
saw 1
or 1
felt 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
doing 1
but 1
kept 1
sitting 1
on 1
at 1
its 1
ease 1
Then 1
the 1
father 1
took 1
the 1
eggs 1
and 1
put 1
one 1
on 1
each 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
the 1
fifth 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
huntsman 1
Cut 1
all 1
the 1
eggs 1
in 1
two 1
pieces 1
at 1
one 1
shot 1
The 1
huntsman 1
took 1
up 1
his 1
bow 1
and 1
at 1
one 1
shot 1
struck 1
all 1
the 1
five 1
eggs 1
as 1
his 1
father 1
wished 1
Now 1
comes 1
your 1
turn 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
the 1
young 1
tailor 1
sew 1
the 1
eggs 1
and 1
the 1
young 1
birds 1
in 1
them 1
together 1
again 1
so 1
neatly 1
that 1
the 1
shot 1
shall 1
have 1
done 1
them 1
no 1
harm 1
Then 1
the 1
tailor 1
took 1
his 1
needle 1
and 1
sewed 1
the 1
eggs 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
told 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
the 1
thief 1
was 1
sent 1
to 1
take 1
them 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
nest 1
and 1
put 1
them 1
under 1
the 1
bird 1
without 1
its 1
knowing 1
it 1
Then 1
she 1
went 1
on 1
sitting 1
and 1
hatched 1
them 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
they 1
crawled 1
out 1
and 1
had 1
only 1
a 1
little 1
red 1
streak 1
across 1
their 1
necks 1
where 1
the 1
tailor 1
had 1
sewn 1
them 1
together 1
Well 1
done 1
sons 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
good 1
use 1
of 1
your 1
time 1
and 1
learnt 1
something 1
worth 1
the 1
knowing 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
which 1
ought 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
prize 1
Oh 1
that 1
a 1
time 1
might 1
soon 1
come 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
turn 1
your 1
skill 1
to 1
some 1
account 1
Not 1
long 1
after 1
this 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
bustle 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
for 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
had 1
been 1
carried 1
off 1
by 1
a 1
mighty 1
dragon 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
mourned 1
over 1
his 1
loss 1
day 1
and 1
night 1
and 1
made 1
it 1
known 1
that 1
whoever 1
brought 1
her 1
back 1
to 1
him 1
should 1
have 1
her 1
for 1
a 1
wife 1
Then 1
the 1
four 1
brothers 1
said 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
Here 1
is 1
a 1
chance 1
for 1
us 1
let 1
us 1
try 1
what 1
we 1
can 1
do 1
And 1
they 1
agreed 1
to 1
see 1
whether 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
set 1
the 1
princess 1
free 1
I 1
will 1
soon 1
find 1
out 1
where 1
she 1
is 1
however 1
said 1
the 1
star 1
gazer 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
through 1
his 1
glass 1
and 1
he 1
soon 1
cried 1
out 1
I 1
see 1
her 1
afar 1
off 1
sitting 1
upon 1
a 1
rock 1
in 1
the 1
sea 1
and 1
I 1
can 1
spy 1
the 1
dragon 1
close 1
by 1
guarding 1
her 1
Then 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
asked 1
for 1
a 1
ship 1
for 1
himself 1
and 1
his 1
brothers 1
and 1
they 1
sailed 1
together 1
over 1
the 1
sea 1
till 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
place 1
There 1
they 1
found 1
the 1
princess 1
sitting 1
as 1
the 1
star 1
gazer 1
had 1
said 1
on 1
the 1
rock 1
and 1
the 1
dragon 1
was 1
lying 1
asleep 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
upon 1
her 1
lap 1
I 1
dare 1
not 1
shoot 1
at 1
him 1
said 1
the 1
huntsman 1
for 1
I 1
should 1
kill 1
the 1
beautiful 1
young 1
lady 1
also 1
Then 1
I 1
will 1
try 1
my 1
skill 1
said 1
the 1
thief 1
and 1
went 1
and 1
stole 1
her 1
away 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
dragon 1
so 1
quietly 1
and 1
gently 1
that 1
the 1
beast 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
it 1
but 1
went 1
on 1
snoring 1
Then 1
away 1
they 1
hastened 1
with 1
her 1
full 1
of 1
joy 1
in 1
their 1
boat 1
towards 1
the 1
ship 1
but 1
soon 1
came 1
the 1
dragon 1
roaring 1
behind 1
them 1
through 1
the 1
air 1
for 1
he 1
awoke 1
and 1
missed 1
the 1
princess 1
But 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
over 1
the 1
boat 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
pounce 1
upon 1
them 1
and 1
carry 1
off 1
the 1
princess 1
the 1
huntsman 1
took 1
up 1
his 1
bow 1
and 1
shot 1
him 1
straight 1
through 1
the 1
heart 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
fell 1
down 1
dead 1
They 1
were 1
still 1
not 1
safe 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
great 1
beast 1
that 1
in 1
his 1
fall 1
he 1
overset 1
the 1
boat 1
and 1
they 1
had 1
to 1
swim 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
sea 1
upon 1
a 1
few 1
planks 1
So 1
the 1
tailor 1
took 1
his 1
needle 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
few 1
large 1
stitches 1
put 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
planks 1
together 1
and 1
he 1
sat 1
down 1
upon 1
these 1
and 1
sailed 1
about 1
and 1
gathered 1
up 1
all 1
pieces 1
of 1
the 1
boat 1
and 1
then 1
tacked 1
them 1
together 1
so 1
quickly 1
that 1
the 1
boat 1
was 1
soon 1
ready 1
and 1
they 1
then 1
reached 1
the 1
ship 1
and 1
got 1
home 1
safe 1
When 1
they 1
had 1
brought 1
home 1
the 1
princess 1
to 1
her 1
father 1
there 1
was 1
great 1
rejoicing 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
four 1
brothers 1
One 1
of 1
you 1
shall 1
marry 1
her 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
settle 1
amongst 1
yourselves 1
which 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
Then 1
there 1
arose 1
a 1
quarrel 1
between 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
star 1
gazer 1
said 1
If 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
found 1
the 1
princess 1
out 1
all 1
your 1
skill 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
therefore 1
she 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
mine 1
Your 1
seeing 1
her 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
said 1
the 1
thief 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
taken 1
her 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
dragon 1
therefore 1
she 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
mine 1
No 1
she 1
is 1
mine 1
said 1
the 1
huntsman 1
for 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
killed 1
the 1
dragon 1
he 1
would 1
after 1
all 1
have 1
torn 1
you 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
into 1
pieces 1
And 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
sewn 1
the 1
boat 1
together 1
again 1
said 1
the 1
tailor 1
you 1
would 1
all 1
have 1
been 1
drowned 1
therefore 1
she 1
is 1
mine 1
Then 1
the 1
king 1
put 1
in 1
a 1
word 1
and 1
said 1
Each 1
of 1
you 1
is 1
right 1
and 1
as 1
all 1
cannot 1
have 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
the 1
best 1
way 1
is 1
for 1
neither 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
have 1
her 1
for 1
the 1
truth 1
is 1
there 1
is 1
somebody 1
she 1
likes 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
better 1
But 1
to 1
make 1
up 1
for 1
your 1
loss 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
each 1
of 1
you 1
as 1
a 1
reward 1
for 1
his 1
skill 1
half 1
a 1
kingdom 1
So 1
the 1
brothers 1
agreed 1
that 1
this 1
plan 1
would 1
be 1
much 1
better 1
than 1
either 1
quarrelling 1
or 1
marrying 1
a 1
lady 1
who 1
had 1
no 1
mind 1
to 1
have 1
them 1
And 1
the 1
king 1
then 1
gave 1
to 1
each 1
half 1
a 1
kingdom 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
said 1
and 1
they 1
lived 1
very 1
happily 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
their 1
days 1
and 1
took 1
good 1
care 1
of 1
their 1
father 1
and 1
somebody 1
took 1
better 1
care 1
of 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
than 1
to 1
let 1
either 1
the 1
dragon 1
or 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
craftsmen 1
have 1
her 1
again 1
LILY 1
AND 1
THE 1
LION 1
A 1
merchant 1
who 1
had 1
three 1
daughters 1
was 1
once 1
setting 1
out 1
upon 1
a 1
journey 1
but 1
before 1
he 1
went 1
he 1
asked 1
each 1
daughter 1
what 1
gift 1
he 1
should 1
bring 1
back 1
for 1
her 1
The 1
eldest 1
wished 1
for 1
pearls 1
the 1
second 1
for 1
jewels 1
but 1
the 1
third 1
who 1
was 1
called 1
Lily 1
said 1
Dear 1
father 1
bring 1
me 1
a 1
rose 1
Now 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
easy 1
task 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
rose 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
winter 1
yet 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
his 1
prettiest 1
daughter 1
and 1
was 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
flowers 1
her 1
father 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
try 1
what 1
he 1
could 1
do 1
So 1
he 1
kissed 1
all 1
three 1
and 1
bid 1
them 1
goodbye 1
And 1
when 1
the 1
time 1
came 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
he 1
had 1
bought 1
pearls 1
and 1
jewels 1
for 1
the 1
two 1
eldest 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
sought 1
everywhere 1
in 1
vain 1
for 1
the 1
rose 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
any 1
garden 1
and 1
asked 1
for 1
such 1
a 1
thing 1
the 1
people 1
laughed 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
whether 1
he 1
thought 1
roses 1
grew 1
in 1
snow 1
This 1
grieved 1
him 1
very 1
much 1
for 1
Lily 1
was 1
his 1
dearest 1
child 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
journeying 1
home 1
thinking 1
what 1
he 1
should 1
bring 1
her 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
fine 1
castle 1
and 1
around 1
the 1
castle 1
was 1
a 1
garden 1
in 1
one 1
half 1
of 1
which 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
summer 1
time 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
half 1
winter 1
On 1
one 1
side 1
the 1
finest 1
flowers 1
were 1
in 1
full 1
bloom 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
everything 1
looked 1
dreary 1
and 1
buried 1
in 1
the 1
snow 1
A 1
lucky 1
hit 1
said 1
he 1
as 1
he 1
called 1
to 1
his 1
servant 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
a 1
beautiful 1
bed 1
of 1
roses 1
that 1
was 1
there 1
and 1
bring 1
him 1
away 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
finest 1
flowers 1
This 1
done 1
they 1
were 1
riding 1
away 1
well 1
pleased 1
when 1
up 1
sprang 1
a 1
fierce 1
lion 1
and 1
roared 1
out 1
Whoever 1
has 1
stolen 1
my 1
roses 1
shall 1
be 1
eaten 1
up 1
alive 1
Then 1
the 1
man 1
said 1
I 1
knew 1
not 1
that 1
the 1
garden 1
belonged 1
to 1
you 1
can 1
nothing 1
save 1
my 1
life 1
No 1
said 1
the 1
lion 1
nothing 1
unless 1
you 1
undertake 1
to 1
give 1
me 1
whatever 1
meets 1
you 1
on 1
your 1
return 1
home 1
if 1
you 1
agree 1
to 1
this 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
your 1
life 1
and 1
the 1
rose 1
too 1
for 1
your 1
daughter 1
But 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
unwilling 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
and 1
said 1
It 1
may 1
be 1
my 1
youngest 1
daughter 1
who 1
loves 1
me 1
most 1
and 1
always 1
runs 1
to 1
meet 1
me 1
when 1
I 1
go 1
home 1
Then 1
the 1
servant 1
was 1
greatly 1
frightened 1
and 1
said 1
It 1
may 1
perhaps 1
be 1
only 1
a 1
cat 1
or 1
a 1
dog 1
And 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
man 1
yielded 1
with 1
a 1
heavy 1
heart 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
rose 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
give 1
the 1
lion 1
whatever 1
should 1
meet 1
him 1
first 1
on 1
his 1
return 1
And 1
as 1
he 1
came 1
near 1
home 1
it 1
was 1
Lily 1
his 1
youngest 1
and 1
dearest 1
daughter 1
that 1
met 1
him 1
she 1
came 1
running 1
and 1
kissed 1
him 1
and 1
welcomed 1
him 1
home 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
brought 1
her 1
the 1
rose 1
she 1
was 1
still 1
more 1
glad 1
But 1
her 1
father 1
began 1
to 1
be 1
very 1
sorrowful 1
and 1
to 1
weep 1
saying 1
Alas 1
my 1
dearest 1
child 1
I 1
have 1
bought 1
this 1
flower 1
at 1
a 1
high 1
price 1
for 1
I 1
have 1
said 1
I 1
would 1
give 1
you 1
to 1
a 1
wild 1
lion 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
has 1
you 1
he 1
will 1
tear 1
you 1
in 1
pieces 1
and 1
eat 1
you 1
Then 1
he 1
told 1
her 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
happened 1
and 1
said 1
she 1
should 1
not 1
go 1
let 1
what 1
would 1
happen 1
But 1
she 1
comforted 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
Dear 1
father 1
the 1
word 1
you 1
have 1
given 1
must 1
be 1
kept 1
I 1
will 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
lion 1
and 1
soothe 1
him 1
perhaps 1
he 1
will 1
let 1
me 1
come 1
safe 1
home 1
again 1
The 1
next 1
morning 1
she 1
asked 1
the 1
way 1
she 1
was 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
took 1
leave 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
went 1
forth 1
with 1
a 1
bold 1
heart 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
But 1
the 1
lion 1
was 1
an 1
enchanted 1
prince 1
By 1
day 1
he 1
and 1
all 1
his 1
court 1
were 1
lions 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
they 1
took 1
their 1
right 1
forms 1
again 1
And 1
when 1
Lily 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
castle 1
he 1
welcomed 1
her 1
so 1
courteously 1
that 1
she 1
agreed 1
to 1
marry 1
him 1
The 1
wedding 1
feast 1
was 1
held 1
and 1
they 1
lived 1
happily 1
together 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
The 1
prince 1
was 1
only 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
evening 1
came 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
held 1
his 1
court 1
but 1
every 1
morning 1
he 1
left 1
his 1
bride 1
and 1
went 1
away 1
by 1
himself 1
she 1
knew 1
not 1
whither 1
till 1
the 1
night 1
came 1
again 1
After 1
some 1
time 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
Tomorrow 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
great 1
feast 1
in 1
your 1
father 1
s 1
house 1
for 1
your 1
eldest 1
sister 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
wish 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
visit 1
her 1
my 1
lions 1
shall 1
lead 1
you 1
thither 1
Then 1
she 1
rejoiced 1
much 1
at 1
the 1
thoughts 1
of 1
seeing 1
her 1
father 1
once 1
more 1
and 1
set 1
out 1
with 1
the 1
lions 1
and 1
everyone 1
was 1
overjoyed 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
thought 1
her 1
dead 1
long 1
since 1
But 1
she 1
told 1
them 1
how 1
happy 1
she 1
was 1
and 1
stayed 1
till 1
the 1
feast 1
was 1
over 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
wood 1
Her 1
second 1
sister 1
was 1
soon 1
after 1
married 1
and 1
when 1
Lily 1
was 1
asked 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
wedding 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
prince 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
go 1
alone 1
this 1
time 1
you 1
must 1
go 1
with 1
me 1
But 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
very 1
hazardous 1
thing 1
for 1
if 1
the 1
least 1
ray 1
of 1
the 1
torch 1
light 1
should 1
fall 1
upon 1
him 1
his 1
enchantment 1
would 1
become 1
still 1
worse 1
for 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
changed 1
into 1
a 1
dove 1
and 1
be 1
forced 1
to 1
wander 1
about 1
the 1
world 1
for 1
seven 1
long 1
years 1
However 1
she 1
gave 1
him 1
no 1
rest 1
and 1
said 1
she 1
would 1
take 1
care 1
no 1
light 1
should 1
fall 1
upon 1
him 1
So 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
set 1
out 1
together 1
and 1
took 1
with 1
them 1
their 1
little 1
child 1
and 1
she 1
chose 1
a 1
large 1
hall 1
with 1
thick 1
walls 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
sit 1
in 1
while 1
the 1
wedding 1
torches 1
were 1
lighted 1
but 1
unluckily 1
no 1
one 1
saw 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
crack 1
in 1
the 1
door 1
Then 1
the 1
wedding 1
was 1
held 1
with 1
great 1
pomp 1
but 1
as 1
the 1
train 1
came 1
from 1
the 1
church 1
and 1
passed 1
with 1
the 1
torches 1
before 1
the 1
hall 1
a 1
very 1
small 1
ray 1
of 1
light 1
fell 1
upon 1
the 1
prince 1
In 1
a 1
moment 1
he 1
disappeared 1
and 1
when 1
his 1
wife 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
looked 1
for 1
him 1
she 1
found 1
only 1
a 1
white 1
dove 1
and 1
it 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
Seven 1
years 1
must 1
I 1
fly 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
over 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
but 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
will 1
let 1
fall 1
a 1
white 1
feather 1
that 1
will 1
show 1
you 1
the 1
way 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
follow 1
it 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
you 1
may 1
overtake 1
and 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
This 1
said 1
he 1
flew 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
poor 1
Lily 1
followed 1
and 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
white 1
feather 1
fell 1
and 1
showed 1
her 1
the 1
way 1
she 1
was 1
to 1
journey 1
Thus 1
she 1
went 1
roving 1
on 1
through 1
the 1
wide 1
world 1
and 1
looked 1
neither 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
hand 1
nor 1
to 1
the 1
left 1
nor 1
took 1
any 1
rest 1
for 1
seven 1
years 1
Then 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
be 1
glad 1
and 1
thought 1
to 1
herself 1
that 1
the 1
time 1
was 1
fast 1
coming 1
when 1
all 1
her 1
troubles 1
should 1
end 1
yet 1
repose 1
was 1
still 1
far 1
off 1
for 1
one 1
day 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
travelling 1
on 1
she 1
missed 1
the 1
white 1
feather 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
lifted 1
up 1
her 1
eyes 1
she 1
could 1
nowhere 1
see 1
the 1
dove 1
Now 1
thought 1
she 1
to 1
herself 1
no 1
aid 1
of 1
man 1
can 1
be 1
of 1
use 1
to 1
me 1
So 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
said 1
Thou 1
shinest 1
everywhere 1
on 1
the 1
hill 1
s 1
top 1
and 1
the 1
valley 1
s 1
depth 1
hast 1
thou 1
anywhere 1
seen 1
my 1
white 1
dove 1
No 1
said 1
the 1
sun 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
seen 1
it 1
but 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
thee 1
a 1
casket 1
open 1
it 1
when 1
thy 1
hour 1
of 1
need 1
comes 1
So 1
she 1
thanked 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
her 1
way 1
till 1
eventide 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
moon 1
arose 1
she 1
cried 1
unto 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
Thou 1
shinest 1
through 1
the 1
night 1
over 1
field 1
and 1
grove 1
hast 1
thou 1
nowhere 1
seen 1
my 1
white 1
dove 1
No 1
said 1
the 1
moon 1
I 1
cannot 1
help 1
thee 1
but 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
thee 1
an 1
egg 1
break 1
it 1
when 1
need 1
comes 1
Then 1
she 1
thanked 1
the 1
moon 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
till 1
the 1
night 1
wind 1
blew 1
and 1
she 1
raised 1
up 1
her 1
voice 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
Thou 1
blowest 1
through 1
every 1
tree 1
and 1
under 1
every 1
leaf 1
hast 1
thou 1
not 1
seen 1
my 1
white 1
dove 1
No 1
said 1
the 1
night 1
wind 1
but 1
I 1
will 1
ask 1
three 1
other 1
winds 1
perhaps 1
they 1
have 1
seen 1
it 1
Then 1
the 1
east 1
wind 1
and 1
the 1
west 1
wind 1
came 1
and 1
said 1
they 1
too 1
had 1
not 1
seen 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
south 1
wind 1
said 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
the 1
white 1
dove 1
he 1
has 1
fled 1
to 1
the 1
Red 1
Sea 1
and 1
is 1
changed 1
once 1
more 1
into 1
a 1
lion 1
for 1
the 1
seven 1
years 1
are 1
passed 1
away 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
is 1
fighting 1
with 1
a 1
dragon 1
and 1
the 1
dragon 1
is 1
an 1
enchanted 1
princess 1
who 1
seeks 1
to 1
separate 1
him 1
from 1
you 1
Then 1
the 1
night 1
wind 1
said 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
thee 1
counsel 1
Go 1
to 1
the 1
Red 1
Sea 1
on 1
the 1
right 1
shore 1
stand 1
many 1
rods 1
count 1
them 1
and 1
when 1
thou 1
comest 1
to 1
the 1
eleventh 1
break 1
it 1
off 1
and 1
smite 1
the 1
dragon 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
lion 1
will 1
have 1
the 1
victory 1
and 1
both 1
of 1
them 1
will 1
appear 1
to 1
you 1
in 1
their 1
own 1
forms 1
Then 1
look 1
round 1
and 1
thou 1
wilt 1
see 1
a 1
griffin 1
winged 1
like 1
bird 1
sitting 1
by 1
the 1
Red 1
Sea 1
jump 1
on 1
to 1
his 1
back 1
with 1
thy 1
beloved 1
one 1
as 1
quickly 1
as 1
possible 1
and 1
he 1
will 1
carry 1
you 1
over 1
the 1
waters 1
to 1
your 1
home 1
I 1
will 1
also 1
give 1
thee 1
this 1
nut 1
continued 1
the 1
night 1
wind 1
When 1
you 1
are 1
half 1
way 1
over 1
throw 1
it 1
down 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
waters 1
will 1
immediately 1
spring 1
up 1
a 1
high 1
nut 1
tree 1
on 1
which 1
the 1
griffin 1
will 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
rest 1
otherwise 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
the 1
strength 1
to 1
bear 1
you 1
the 1
whole 1
way 1
if 1
therefore 1
thou 1
dost 1
forget 1
to 1
throw 1
down 1
the 1
nut 1
he 1
will 1
let 1
you 1
both 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
sea 1
So 1
our 1
poor 1
wanderer 1
went 1
forth 1
and 1
found 1
all 1
as 1
the 1
night 1
wind 1
had 1
said 1
and 1
she 1
plucked 1
the 1
eleventh 1
rod 1
and 1
smote 1
the 1
dragon 1
and 1
the 1
lion 1
forthwith 1
became 1
a 1
prince 1
and 1
the 1
dragon 1
a 1
princess 1
again 1
But 1
no 1
sooner 1
was 1
the 1
princess 1
released 1
from 1
the 1
spell 1
than 1
she 1
seized 1
the 1
prince 1
by 1
the 1
arm 1
and 1
sprang 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
griffin 1
s 1
back 1
and 1
went 1
off 1
carrying 1
the 1
prince 1
away 1
with 1
her 1
Thus 1
the 1
unhappy 1
traveller 1
was 1
again 1
forsaken 1
and 1
forlorn 1
but 1
she 1
took 1
heart 1
and 1
said 1
As 1
far 1
as 1
the 1
wind 1
blows 1
and 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
the 1
cock 1
crows 1
I 1
will 1
journey 1
on 1
till 1
I 1
find 1
him 1
once 1
again 1
She 1
went 1
on 1
for 1
a 1
long 2
way 1
till 1
at 1
length 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
castle 1
whither 1
the 1
princess 1
had 1
carried 1
the 1
prince 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
feast 1
got 1
ready 1
and 1
she 1
heard 1
that 1
the 1
wedding 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
be 1
held 1
Heaven 1
aid 1
me 1
now 1
said 1
she 1
and 1
she 1
took 1
the 1
casket 1
that 1
the 1
sun 1
had 1
given 1
her 1
and 1
found 1
that 1
within 1
it 1
lay 1
a 1
dress 1
as 1
dazzling 1
as 1
the 1
sun 1
itself 1
So 1
she 1
put 1
it 1
on 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
palace 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
people 1
gazed 1
upon 1
her 1
and 1
the 1
dress 1
pleased 1
the 1
bride 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
she 1
asked 1
whether 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
sold 1
Not 1
for 1
gold 1
and 1
silver 1
said 1
she 1
but 1
for 1
flesh 1
and 1
blood 1
The 1
princess 1
asked 1
what 1
she 1
meant 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
Let 1
me 1
speak 1
with 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
this 1
night 1
in 1
his 1
chamber 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
thee 1
the 1
dress 1
At 1
last 1
the 1
princess 1
agreed 1
but 1
she 1
told 1
her 1
chamberlain 1
to 1
give 1
the 1
prince 1
a 1
sleeping 1
draught 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
not 1
hear 1
or 1
see 1
her 1
When 1
evening 1
came 1
and 1
the 1
prince 1
had 1
fallen 1
asleep 1
she 1
was 1
led 1
into 1
his 1
chamber 1
and 1
she 1
sat 1
herself 1
down 1
at 1
his 1
feet 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
have 1
followed 1
thee 1
seven 1
years 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
to 1
the 1
sun 1
the 1
moon 1
and 1
the 1
night 1
wind 1
to 1
seek 1
thee 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
I 1
have 1
helped 1
thee 1
to 1
overcome 1
the 1
dragon 1
Wilt 1
thou 1
then 1
forget 1
me 1
quite 1
But 1
the 1
prince 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
slept 1
so 1
soundly 1
that 1
her 1
voice 1
only 1
passed 1
over 1
him 1
and 1
seemed 1
like 1
the 1
whistling 1
of 1
the 1
wind 1
among 1
the 1
fir 1
trees 1
Then 1
poor 1
Lily 1
was 1
led 1
away 1
and 1
forced 1
to 1
give 1
up 1
the 1
golden 1
dress 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
help 1
for 1
her 1
she 1
went 1
out 1
into 1
a 1
meadow 1
and 1
sat 1
herself 1
down 1
and 1
wept 1
But 1
as 1
she 1
sat 1
she 1
bethought 1
herself 1
of 1
the 1
egg 1
that 1
the 1
moon 1
had 1
given 1
her 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
broke 1
it 1
there 1
ran 1
out 1
a 1
hen 1
and 1
twelve 1
chickens 1
of 1
pure 1
gold 1
that 1
played 1
about 1
and 1
then 1
nestled 1
under 1
the 1
old 1
one 1
s 1
wings 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
form 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
sight 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
And 1
she 1
rose 1
up 1
and 1
drove 1
them 1
before 1
her 1
till 1
the 1
bride 1
saw 1
them 1
from 1
her 1
window 1
and 1
was 1
so 1
pleased 1
that 1
she 1
came 1
forth 1
and 1
asked 1
her 1
if 1
she 1
would 1
sell 1
the 1
brood 1
Not 1
for 1
gold 1
or 1
silver 1
but 1
for 1
flesh 1
and 1
blood 1
let 1
me 1
again 1
this 1
evening 1
speak 1
with 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
in 1
his 1
chamber 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
thee 1
the 1
whole 1
brood 1
Then 1
the 1
princess 1
thought 1
to 1
betray 1
her 1
as 1
before 1
and 1
agreed 1
to 1
what 1
she 1
asked 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
prince 1
went 1
to 1
his 1
chamber 1
he 1
asked 1
the 1
chamberlain 1
why 1
the 1
wind 1
had 1
whistled 1
so 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
And 1
the 1
chamberlain 1
told 1
him 1
all 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
given 1
him 1
a 1
sleeping 1
draught 1
and 1
how 1
a 1
poor 1
maiden 1
had 1
come 1
and 1
spoken 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
chamber 1
and 1
was 1
to 1
come 1
again 1
that 1
night 1
Then 1
the 1
prince 1
took 1
care 1
to 1
throw 1
away 1
the 1
sleeping 1
draught 1
and 1
when 1
Lily 1
came 1
and 1
began 1
again 1
to 1
tell 1
him 1
what 1
woes 1
had 1
befallen 1
her 1
and 1
how 1
faithful 1
and 1
true 1
to 1
him 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
he 1
knew 1
his 1
beloved 1
wife 1
s 1
voice 1
and 1
sprang 1
up 1
and 1
said 1
You 1
have 1
awakened 1
me 1
as 1
from 1
a 1
dream 1
for 1
the 1
strange 1
princess 1
had 1
thrown 1
a 1
spell 1
around 1
me 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
altogether 1
forgotten 1
you 1
but 1
Heaven 1
hath 1
sent 1
you 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
a 1
lucky 1
hour 1
And 1
they 1
stole 1
away 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
palace 1
by 1
night 1
unawares 1
and 1
seated 1
themselves 1
on 1
the 1
griffin 1
who 1
flew 1
back 1
with 1
them 1
over 1
the 1
Red 1
Sea 1
When 1
they 1
were 1
half 1
way 1
across 1
Lily 1
let 1
the 1
nut 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
immediately 1
a 1
large 1
nut 1
tree 1
arose 1
from 1
the 1
sea 1
whereon 1
the 1
griffin 1
rested 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
then 1
carried 1
them 1
safely 1
home 1
There 1
they 1
found 1
their 1
child 1
now 1
grown 1
up 1
to 1
be 1
comely 1
and 1
fair 1
and 1
after 1
all 1
their 1
troubles 1
they 1
lived 1
happily 1
together 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
their 1
days 1
THE 1
FOX 1
AND 1
THE 1
HORSE 1
A 1
farmer 1
had 1
a 1
horse 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
an 1
excellent 1
faithful 1
servant 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
now 1
grown 1
too 1
old 1
to 1
work 1
so 1
the 1
farmer 1
would 1
give 1
him 1
nothing 1
more 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
want 1
you 1
no 1
longer 1
so 1
take 1
yourself 1
off 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
stable 1
I 1
shall 1
not 1
take 1
you 1
back 1
again 1
until 1
you 1
are 1
stronger 1
than 1
a 1
lion 1
Then 1
he 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
turned 1
him 1
adrift 1
The 1
poor 1
horse 1
was 1
very 1
melancholy 1
and 1
wandered 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
seeking 1
some 1
little 1
shelter 1
from 1
the 1
cold 1
wind 1
and 1
rain 1
Presently 1
a 1
fox 1
met 1
him 1
What 1
s 1
the 1
matter 1
my 1
friend 1
said 1
he 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
hang 1
down 1
your 1
head 1
and 1
look 1
so 1
lonely 1
and 1
woe 1
begone 1
Ah 1
replied 1
the 1
horse 1
justice 1
and 1
avarice 1
never 1
dwell 1
in 1
one 1
house 1
my 1
master 1
has 1
forgotten 1
all 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
done 1
for 1
him 1
so 1
many 1
years 1
and 1
because 1
I 1
can 1
no 1
longer 1
work 1
he 1
has 1
turned 1
me 1
adrift 1
and 1
says 1
unless 1
I 1
become 1
stronger 1
than 1
a 1
lion 1
he 1
will 1
not 1
take 1
me 1
back 1
again 1
what 1
chance 1
can 1
I 1
have 1
of 1
that 1
he 1
knows 1
I 1
have 1
none 1
or 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
talk 1
so 1
However 1
the 1
fox 1
bid 1
him 1
be 1
of 1
good 1
cheer 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
will 1
help 1
you 1
lie 1
down 1
there 1
stretch 1
yourself 1
out 1
quite 1
stiff 1
and 1
pretend 1
to 1
be 1
dead 1
The 1
horse 1
did 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
told 1
and 1
the 1
fox 1
went 1
straight 1
to 1
the 1
lion 1
who 1
lived 1
in 1
a 1
cave 1
close 1
by 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
A 1
little 1
way 1
off 1
lies 1
a 1
dead 1
horse 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
you 1
may 1
make 1
an 1
excellent 1
meal 1
of 1
his 1
carcase 1
The 1
lion 1
was 1
greatly 1
pleased 1
and 1
set 1
off 1
immediately 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
horse 1
the 1
fox 1
said 1
You 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
eat 1
him 1
comfortably 1
here 1
I 1
ll 1
tell 1
you 1
what 1
I 1
will 1
tie 1
you 1
fast 1
to 1
his 1
tail 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
can 1
draw 1
him 1
to 1
your 1
den 1
and 1
eat 1
him 1
at 1
your 1
leisure 1
This 1
advice 1
pleased 1
the 1
lion 1
so 1
he 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
quietly 1
for 1
the 1
fox 1
to 1
make 1
him 1
fast 1
to 1
the 1
horse 1
But 1
the 1
fox 1
managed 1
to 1
tie 1
his 1
legs 1
together 1
and 1
bound 1
all 1
so 1
hard 1
and 1
fast 1
that 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
strength 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
set 1
himself 1
free 1
When 1
the 1
work 1
was 1
done 1
the 1
fox 1
clapped 1
the 1
horse 1
on 1
the 1
shoulder 1
and 1
said 1
Jip 1
Dobbin 1
Jip 1
Then 1
up 1
he 1
sprang 1
and 1
moved 1
off 1
dragging 1
the 1
lion 1
behind 1
him 1
The 1
beast 1
began 1
to 1
roar 1
and 1
bellow 1
till 1
all 1
the 1
birds 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
flew 1
away 1
for 1
fright 1
but 1
the 1
horse 1
let 1
him 1
sing 1
on 1
and 1
made 1
his 1
way 1
quietly 1
over 1
the 1
fields 1
to 1
his 1
master 1
s 1
house 1
Here 1
he 1
is 1
master 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
have 1
got 1
the 1
better 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
farmer 1
saw 1
his 1
old 1
servant 1
his 1
heart 1
relented 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
Thou 1
shalt 1
stay 1
in 1
thy 1
stable 1
and 1
be 1
well 1
taken 1
care 1
of 1
And 1
so 1
the 1
poor 1
old 1
horse 1
had 1
plenty 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
lived 1
till 1
he 1
died 1
THE 1
BLUE 1
LIGHT 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
a 1
soldier 1
who 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
had 1
served 1
the 1
king 1
faithfully 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
war 1
came 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
could 1
serve 1
no 1
longer 1
because 1
of 1
the 1
many 1
wounds 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
received 1
The 1
king 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
You 1
may 1
return 1
to 1
your 1
home 1
I 1
need 1
you 1
no 1
longer 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
receive 1
any 1
more 1
money 1
for 1
he 1
only 1
receives 1
wages 1
who 1
renders 1
me 1
service 1
for 1
them 1
Then 1
the 1
soldier 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
earn 1
a 1
living 1
went 1
away 1
greatly 1
troubled 1
and 1
walked 1
the 1
whole 1
day 1
until 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
he 1
entered 1
a 1
forest 1
When 1
darkness 1
came 1
on 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
light 1
which 1
he 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
and 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
house 1
wherein 1
lived 1
a 1
witch 1
Do 1
give 1
me 1
one 1
night 1
s 1
lodging 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
drink 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
her 1
or 1
I 1
shall 1
starve 1
Oho 1
she 1
answered 1
who 1
gives 1
anything 1
to 1
a 1
run 1
away 1
soldier 1
Yet 1
will 1
I 1
be 1
compassionate 1
and 1
take 1
you 1
in 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
do 1
what 1
I 1
wish 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
wish 1
said 1
the 1
soldier 1
That 1
you 1
should 1
dig 1
all 1
round 1
my 1
garden 1
for 1
me 1
tomorrow 1
The 1
soldier 1
consented 1
and 1
next 1
day 1
laboured 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
strength 1
but 1
could 1
not 1
finish 1
it 1
by 1
the 1
evening 1
I 1
see 1
well 1
enough 1
said 1
the 1
witch 1
that 1
you 1
can 1
do 1
no 1
more 1
today 1
but 1
I 1
will 1
keep 1
you 1
yet 1
another 1
night 1
in 1
payment 1
for 1
which 1
you 1
must 1
tomorrow 1
chop 1
me 1
a 1
load 1
of 1
wood 1
and 1
chop 1
it 1
small 1
The 1
soldier 1
spent 1
the 1
whole 1
day 1
in 1
doing 1
it 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
the 1
witch 1
proposed 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
stay 1
one 1
night 1
more 1
Tomorrow 1
you 1
shall 1
only 1
do 1
me 1
a 1
very 1
trifling 1
piece 1
of 1
work 1
Behind 1
my 1
house 1
there 1
is 1
an 1
old 1
dry 1
well 1
into 1
which 1
my 1
light 1
has 1
fallen 1
it 1
burns 1
blue 1
and 1
never 1
goes 1
out 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
bring 1
it 1
up 1
again 1
Next 1
day 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
took 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
let 1
him 1
down 1
in 1
a 1
basket 1
He 1
found 1
the 1
blue 1
light 1
and 1
made 1
her 1
a 1
signal 1
to 1
draw 1
him 1
up 1
again 1
She 1
did 1
draw 1
him 1
up 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
near 1
the 1
edge 1
she 1
stretched 1
down 1
her 1
hand 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
blue 1
light 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
No 1
said 1
he 1
perceiving 1
her 1
evil 1
intention 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
give 1
you 1
the 1
light 1
until 1
I 1
am 1
standing 1
with 1
both 1
feet 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
The 1
witch 1
fell 1
into 1
a 1
passion 1
let 1
him 1
fall 1
again 1
into 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
went 1
away 1
The 1
poor 1
soldier 1
fell 1
without 1
injury 1
on 1
the 1
moist 1
ground 1
and 1
the 1
blue 1
light 1
went 1
on 1
burning 1
but 1
of 1
what 1
use 1
was 1
that 1
to 1
him 1
He 1
saw 1
very 1
well 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
escape 1
death 1
He 1
sat 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
very 1
sorrowfully 1
then 1
suddenly 1
he 1
felt 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
found 1
his 1
tobacco 1
pipe 1
which 1
was 1
still 1
half 1
full 1
This 1
shall 1
be 1
my 1
last 1
pleasure 1
thought 1
he 1
pulled 1
it 1
out 1
lit 1
it 1
at 1
the 1
blue 1
light 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
smoke 1
When 1
the 1
smoke 1
had 1
circled 1
about 1
the 1
cavern 1
suddenly 1
a 1
little 1
black 1
dwarf 1
stood 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
Lord 1
what 1
are 1
your 1
commands 1
What 1
my 1
commands 1
are 1
replied 1
the 1
soldier 1
quite 1
astonished 1
I 1
must 1
do 1
everything 1
you 1
bid 1
me 1
said 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
Good 1
said 1
the 1
soldier 1
then 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
place 1
help 1
me 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
well 1
The 1
little 1
man 1
took 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
led 1
him 1
through 1
an 1
underground 1
passage 1
but 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
forget 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
blue 1
light 1
with 1
him 1
On 1
the 1
way 1
the 1
dwarf 1
showed 1
him 1
the 1
treasures 1
which 1
the 1
witch 1
had 1
collected 1
and 1
hidden 1
there 1
and 1
the 1
soldier 1
took 1
as 1
much 1
gold 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
carry 1
When 1
he 1
was 1
above 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
Now 1
go 1
and 1
bind 1
the 1
old 1
witch 1
and 1
carry 1
her 1
before 1
the 1
judge 1
In 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
she 1
came 1
by 1
like 1
the 1
wind 1
riding 1
on 1
a 1
wild 1
tom 1
cat 1
and 1
screaming 1
frightfully 1
Nor 1
was 1
it 1
long 1
before 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
reappeared 1
It 1
is 1
all 1
done 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
the 1
witch 1
is 1
already 1
hanging 1
on 1
the 1
gallows 1
What 1
further 1
commands 1
has 1
my 1
lord 1
inquired 1
the 1
dwarf 1
At 1
this 1
moment 1
none 1
answered 1
the 1
soldier 1
you 1
can 1
return 1
home 1
only 1
be 1
at 1
hand 1
immediately 1
if 1
I 1
summon 1
you 1
Nothing 1
more 1
is 1
needed 1
than 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
light 1
your 1
pipe 1
at 1
the 1
blue 1
light 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
appear 1
before 1
you 1
at 1
once 1
Thereupon 1
he 1
vanished 1
from 1
his 1
sight 1
The 1
soldier 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
town 1
from 1
which 1
he 1
came 1
He 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
best 1
inn 1
ordered 1
himself 1
handsome 1
clothes 1
and 1
then 1
bade 1
the 1
landlord 1
furnish 1
him 1
a 1
room 1
as 1
handsome 1
as 1
possible 1
When 1
it 1
was 1
ready 1
and 1
the 1
soldier 1
had 1
taken 1
possession 1
of 1
it 1
he 1
summoned 1
the 1
little 1
black 1
manikin 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
have 1
served 1
the 1
king 1
faithfully 1
but 1
he 1
has 1
dismissed 1
me 1
and 1
left 1
me 1
to 1
hunger 1
and 1
now 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
take 1
my 1
revenge 1
What 1
am 1
I 1
to 1
do 1
asked 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
Late 1
at 1
night 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
is 1
in 1
bed 1
bring 1
her 1
here 1
in 1
her 1
sleep 1
she 1
shall 1
do 1
servant 1
s 1
work 1
for 1
me 1
The 1
manikin 1
said 1
That 1
is 1
an 1
easy 1
thing 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
a 1
very 1
dangerous 1
thing 1
for 1
you 1
for 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
discovered 1
you 1
will 1
fare 1
ill 1
When 1
twelve 1
o 1
clock 1
had 1
struck 1
the 1
door 1
sprang 1
open 1
and 1
the 1
manikin 1
carried 1
in 1
the 1
princess 1
Aha 1
are 1
you 1
there 1
cried 1
the 1
soldier 1
get 1
to 1
your 1
work 1
at 1
once 1
Fetch 1
the 1
broom 1
and 1
sweep 1
the 1
chamber 1
When 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
this 1
he 1
ordered 1
her 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
stretched 1
out 1
his 1
feet 1
and 1
said 1
Pull 1
off 1
my 1
boots 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
threw 1
them 1
in 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
made 1
her 1
pick 1
them 1
up 1
again 1
and 1
clean 1
and 1
brighten 1
them 1
She 1
however 1
did 1
everything 1
he 1
bade 1
her 1
without 1
opposition 1
silently 1
and 1
with 1
half 1
shut 1
eyes 1
When 1
the 1
first 1
cock 1
crowed 1
the 1
manikin 1
carried 1
her 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
royal 1
palace 1
and 1
laid 1
her 1
in 1
her 1
bed 1
Next 1
morning 1
when 1
the 1
princess 1
arose 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
she 1
had 2
a 1
very 1
strange 1
dream 1
I 1
was 1
carried 1
through 1
the 1
streets 1
with 1
the 1
rapidity 1
of 1
lightning 1
said 1
she 1
and 1
taken 1
into 1
a 1
soldier 1
s 1
room 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
wait 1
upon 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
servant 1
sweep 1
his 1
room 1
clean 1
his 1
boots 1
and 1
do 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
menial 1
work 1
It 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
dream 1
and 1
yet 1
I 1
am 1
just 1
as 1
tired 1
as 1
if 1
I 1
really 1
had 1
done 1
everything 1
The 1
dream 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
true 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
advice 1
Fill 1
your 1
pocket 1
full 1
of 1
peas 1
and 1
make 1
a 1
small 1
hole 1
in 1
the 1
pocket 1
and 1
then 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
carried 1
away 1
again 1
they 1
will 1
fall 1
out 1
and 1
leave 1
a 1
track 1
in 1
the 1
streets 1
But 1
unseen 1
by 1
the 1
king 1
the 1
manikin 1
was 1
standing 1
beside 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
and 1
heard 1
all 1
At 1
night 1
when 1
the 1
sleeping 1
princess 1
was 1
again 1
carried 1
through 1
the 1
streets 1
some 1
peas 1
certainly 1
did 1
fall 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
pocket 1
but 1
they 1
made 1
no 1
track 1
for 1
the 1
crafty 1
manikin 1
had 1
just 1
before 1
scattered 1
peas 1
in 1
every 1
street 1
there 1
was 1
And 1
again 1
the 1
princess 1
was 1
compelled 1
to 1
do 1
servant 1
s 1
work 1
until 1
cock 1
crow 1
Next 1
morning 1
the 1
king 1
sent 1
his 1
people 1
out 1
to 1
seek 1
the 1
track 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
in 1
vain 1
for 1
in 1
every 1
street 1
poor 1
children 1
were 1
sitting 1
picking 1
up 1
peas 1
and 1
saying 1
It 1
must 1
have 1
rained 1
peas 1
last 1
night 1
We 1
must 1
think 1
of 1
something 1
else 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
keep 1
your 1
shoes 1
on 1
when 1
you 1
go 1
to 1
bed 1
and 1
before 1
you 1
come 1
back 1
from 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
you 1
are 1
taken 1
hide 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
there 1
I 1
will 1
soon 1
contrive 1
to 1
find 1
it 1
The 1
black 1
manikin 1
heard 1
this 1
plot 1
and 1
at 1
night 1
when 1
the 1
soldier 1
again 1
ordered 1
him 1
to 1
bring 1
the 1
princess 1
revealed 1
it 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
knew 1
of 1
no 1
expedient 1
to 1
counteract 1
this 1
stratagem 1
and 1
that 1
if 1
the 1
shoe 1
were 1
found 1
in 1
the 1
soldier 1
s 1
house 1
it 1
would 1
go 1
badly 1
with 1
him 1
Do 1
what 1
I 1
bid 1
you 1
replied 1
the 1
soldier 1
and 1
again 1
this 1
third 1
night 1
the 1
princess 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
work 1
like 1
a 1
servant 1
but 1
before 1
she 1
went 1
away 1
she 1
hid 1
her 1
shoe 1
under 1
the 1
bed 1
Next 1
morning 1
the 1
king 1
had 1
the 1
entire 1
town 1
searched 1
for 1
his 1
daughter 1
s 1
shoe 1
It 1
was 1
found 1
at 1
the 1
soldier 1
s 1
and 1
the 1
soldier 1
himself 1
who 1
at 1
the 1
entreaty 1
of 1
the 1
dwarf 1
had 1
gone 1
outside 1
the 1
gate 1
was 1
soon 1
brought 1
back 1
and 1
thrown 1
into 1
prison 1
In 1
his 1
flight 1
he 1
had 1
forgotten 1
the 1
most 1
valuable 1
things 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
blue 1
light 1
and 1
the 1
gold 1
and 1
had 1
only 1
one 1
ducat 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
And 1
now 1
loaded 1
with 1
chains 1
he 1
was 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
of 1
his 1
dungeon 1
when 1
he 1
chanced 1
to 1
see 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
comrades 1
passing 1
by 1
The 1
soldier 1
tapped 1
at 1
the 1
pane 1
of 1
glass 1
and 1
when 1
this 1
man 1
came 1
up 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
Be 1
so 1
kind 1
as 1
to 1
fetch 1
me 1
the 1
small 1
bundle 1
I 1
have 1
left 1
lying 1
in 1
the 1
inn 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
a 1
ducat 1
for 1
doing 1
it 1
His 1
comrade 1
ran 1
thither 1
and 1
brought 1
him 1
what 1
he 1
wanted 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
soldier 1
was 1
alone 1
again 1
he 1
lighted 1
his 1
pipe 1
and 1
summoned 1
the 1
black 1
manikin 1
Have 1
no 1
fear 1
said 1
the 1
latter 1
to 1
his 1
master 1
Go 1
wheresoever 1
they 1
take 1
you 1
and 1
let 1
them 1
do 1
what 1
they 1
will 1
only 1
take 1
the 1
blue 1
light 1
with 1
you 1
Next 1
day 1
the 1
soldier 1
was 1
tried 1
and 1
though 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
nothing 1
wicked 1
the 1
judge 1
condemned 1
him 1
to 1
death 1
When 1
he 1
was 1
led 1
forth 1
to 1
die 1
he 1
begged 1
a 1
last 1
favour 1
of 1
the 1
king 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
asked 1
the 1
king 1
That 1
I 1
may 1
smoke 1
one 1
more 1
pipe 1
on 1
my 1
way 1
You 1
may 1
smoke 1
three 1
answered 1
the 1
king 1
but 1
do 1
not 1
imagine 1
that 1
I 1
will 1
spare 1
your 1
life 1
Then 1
the 1
soldier 1
pulled 1
out 1
his 1
pipe 1
and 1
lighted 1
it 1
at 1
the 1
blue 1
light 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
a 1
few 1
wreaths 1
of 1
smoke 1
had 1
ascended 1
the 1
manikin 1
was 1
there 1
with 1
a 1
small 1
cudgel 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
said 1
What 1
does 1
my 1
lord 1
command 1
Strike 1
down 1
to 1
earth 1
that 1
false 1
judge 1
there 1
and 1
his 1
constable 1
and 1
spare 1
not 1
the 1
king 1
who 1
has 1
treated 1
me 1
so 1
ill 1
Then 1
the 1
manikin 1
fell 1
on 1
them 1
like 1
lightning 1
darting 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
that 1
way 1
and 1
whosoever 1
was 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
touched 1
by 1
his 1
cudgel 1
fell 1
to 1
earth 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
venture 1
to 1
stir 1
again 1
The 1
king 1
was 1
terrified 1
he 1
threw 1
himself 1
on 1
the 1
soldier 1
s 1
mercy 1
and 1
merely 1
to 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
live 1
at 1
all 1
gave 1
him 1
his 1
kingdom 1
for 1
his 1
own 1
and 1
his 1
daughter 1
to 1
wife 1
THE 1
RAVEN 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
queen 1
who 1
had 1
a 1
little 1
daughter 1
still 1
too 1
young 1
to 1
run 1
alone 1
One 1
day 1
the 1
child 1
was 1
very 1
troublesome 1
and 1
the 1
mother 1
could 1
not 1
quiet 1
it 1
do 1
what 1
she 1
would 1
She 1
grew 1
impatient 1
and 1
seeing 1
the 1
ravens 1
flying 1
round 1
the 1
castle 1
she 1
opened 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
wish 1
you 1
were 1
a 1
raven 1
and 1
would 1
fly 1
away 1
then 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
a 1
little 1
peace 1
Scarcely 1
were 1
the 1
words 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
mouth 1
when 1
the 1
child 1
in 1
her 1
arms 1
was 1
turned 1
into 1
a 1
raven 1
and 1
flew 1
away 1
from 1
her 1
through 1
the 1
open 1
window 1
The 1
bird 1
took 1
its 1
flight 1
to 1
a 1
dark 1
wood 1
and 1
remained 1
there 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
and 1
meanwhile 1
the 1
parents 1
could 1
hear 1
nothing 1
of 1
their 1
child 1
Long 1
after 1
this 1
a 1
man 1
was 1
making 1
his 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
wood 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
raven 1
calling 1
and 1
he 1
followed 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
voice 1
As 1
he 1
drew 1
near 1
the 1
raven 1
said 1
I 1
am 1
by 1
birth 1
a 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
but 1
am 1
now 1
under 1
the 1
spell 1
of 1
some 1
enchantment 1
you 1
can 1
however 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
What 1
am 1
I 1
to 1
do 1
he 1
asked 1
She 1
replied 1
Go 1
farther 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
until 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
house 1
wherein 1
lives 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
she 1
will 1
offer 1
you 1
food 1
and 1
drink 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
take 1
of 1
either 1
if 1
you 1
do 1
you 1
will 1
fall 1
into 1
a 1
deep 1
sleep 1
and 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
help 1
me 1
In 1
the 1
garden 1
behind 1
the 1
house 1
is 1
a 1
large 1
tan 1
heap 1
and 1
on 1
that 1
you 1
must 1
stand 1
and 1
watch 1
for 1
me 1
I 1
shall 1
drive 1
there 1
in 1
my 1
carriage 1
at 1
two 1
o 1
clock 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
for 1
three 1
successive 1
days 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
drawn 1
by 1
four 1
white 1
the 1
second 1
by 1
four 1
chestnut 1
and 1
the 1
last 1
by 1
four 1
black 1
horses 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
fail 1
to 1
keep 1
awake 1
and 1
I 1
find 1
you 1
sleeping 1
I 1
shall 1
not 1
be 1
set 1
free 1
The 1
man 1
promised 1
to 1
do 1
all 1
that 1
she 1
wished 1
but 1
the 1
raven 1
said 1
Alas 1
I 1
know 1
even 1
now 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
take 1
something 1
from 1
the 1
woman 1
and 1
be 1
unable 1
to 1
save 1
me 1
The 1
man 1
assured 1
her 1
again 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
on 1
no 1
account 1
touch 1
a 1
thing 1
to 1
eat 1
or 1
drink 1
When 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
went 1
inside 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
met 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
Poor 1
man 1
how 1
tired 1
you 1
are 1
Come 1
in 1
and 1
rest 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
give 1
you 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
drink 1
No 1
answered 1
the 1
man 1
I 1
will 1
neither 1
eat 1
not 1
drink 1
But 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
leave 1
him 1
alone 1
and 1
urged 1
him 1
saying 1
If 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
eat 1
anything 1
at 1
least 1
you 1
might 1
take 1
a 1
draught 1
of 1
wine 1
one 1
drink 1
counts 1
for 1
nothing 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
allowed 1
himself 1
to 1
be 1
persuaded 1
and 1
drank 1
As 1
it 1
drew 1
towards 1
the 1
appointed 1
hour 1
he 1
went 1
outside 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
mounted 1
the 1
tan 1
heap 1
to 1
await 1
the 1
raven 1
Suddenly 1
a 1
feeling 1
of 1
fatigue 1
came 1
over 1
him 1
and 1
unable 1
to 1
resist 1
it 1
he 1
lay 1
down 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
fully 1
determined 1
however 1
to 1
keep 1
awake 1
but 1
in 1
another 1
minute 1
his 1
eyes 1
closed 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
accord 1
and 1
he 1
fell 1
into 1
such 1
a 1
deep 1
sleep 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
noises 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
awakened 1
him 1
At 1
two 1
o 1
clock 1
the 1
raven 1
came 1
driving 1
along 1
drawn 1
by 1
her 1
four 1
white 1
horses 1
but 1
even 1
before 1
she 1
reached 1
the 1
spot 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
herself 1
sighing 1
I 1
know 1
he 1
has 1
fallen 1
asleep 1
When 1
she 1
entered 1
the 1
garden 1
there 1
she 1
found 1
him 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
feared 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
tan 1
heap 1
fast 1
asleep 1
She 1
got 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
carriage 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
him 1
she 1
called 1
him 1
and 1
shook 1
him 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
in 1
vain 1
he 1
still 1
continued 1
sleeping 1
The 1
next 1
day 1
at 1
noon 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
came 1
to 1
him 1
again 1
with 1
food 1
and 1
drink 1
which 1
he 1
at 1
first 1
refused 1
At 1
last 1
overcome 1
by 1
her 1
persistent 1
entreaties 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
take 1
something 1
he 1
lifted 1
the 1
glass 1
and 1
drank 1
again 1
Towards 1
two 1
o 1
clock 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
tan 1
heap 1
to 1
watch 1
for 1
the 1
raven 1
He 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
there 1
long 1
before 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
so 1
tired 1
that 1
his 1
limbs 1
seemed 1
hardly 1
able 1
to 1
support 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
stand 1
upright 1
any 1
longer 1
so 1
again 1
he 1
lay 1
down 1
and 1
fell 1
fast 1
asleep 1
As 1
the 1
raven 1
drove 1
along 1
her 1
four 1
chestnut 1
horses 1
she 1
said 1
sorrowfully 1
to 1
herself 1
I 1
know 1
he 1
has 1
fallen 1
asleep 1
She 1
went 1
as 1
before 1
to 1
look 1
for 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
slept 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
to 1
awaken 1
him 1
The 1
following 1
day 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
What 1
is 1
this 1
You 1
are 1
not 1
eating 1
or 1
drinking 1
anything 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
kill 1
yourself 1
He 1
answered 1
I 1
may 1
not 1
and 1
will 1
not 1
either 1
eat 1
or 1
drink 1
But 1
she 1
put 1
down 1
the 1
dish 1
of 1
food 1
and 1
the 1
glass 1
of 1
wine 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
smelt 1
the 1
wine 1
he 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
resist 1
the 1
temptation 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
deep 1
draught 1
When 1
the 1
hour 1
came 1
round 1
again 1
he 1
went 1
as 1
usual 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
tan 1
heap 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
to 1
await 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
but 1
he 1
felt 1
even 1
more 1
overcome 1
with 1
weariness 1
than 1
on 1
the 1
two 1
previous 1
days 1
and 1
throwing 1
himself 1
down 1
he 1
slept 1
like 1
a 1
log 1
At 1
two 1
o 1
clock 1
the 1
raven 1
could 1
be 1
seen 1
approaching 1
and 1
this 1
time 1
her 1
coachman 1
and 1
everything 1
about 1
her 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
her 1
horses 1
were 1
black 1
She 1
was 1
sadder 1
than 1
ever 1
as 1
she 1
drove 1
along 1
and 1
said 1
mournfully 1
I 1
know 1
he 1
has 1
fallen 1
asleep 1
and 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
She 1
found 1
him 1
sleeping 1
heavily 1
and 1
all 1
her 1
efforts 1
to 1
awaken 1
him 1
were 1
of 1
no 1
avail 1
Then 1
she 1
placed 1
beside 1
him 1
a 1
loaf 1
and 1
some 1
meat 1
and 1
a 1
flask 1
of 1
wine 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
kind 1
that 1
however 1
much 1
he 1
took 1
of 1
them 1
they 1
would 1
never 1
grow 1
less 1
After 1
that 1
she 1
drew 1
a 1
gold 1
ring 1
on 1
which 1
her 1
name 1
was 1
engraved 1
off 1
her 1
finger 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
upon 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
Finally 1
she 1
laid 1
a 1
letter 1
near 1
him 1
in 1
which 1
after 1
giving 1
him 1
particulars 1
of 1
the 1
food 1
and 1
drink 1
she 1
had 1
left 1
for 1
him 1
she 1
finished 1
with 1
the 1
following 1
words 1
I 1
see 1
that 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
you 1
remain 1
here 1
you 1
will 1
never 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
if 1
however 1
you 1
still 1
wish 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
golden 1
castle 1
of 1
Stromberg 1
this 1
is 1
well 1
within 1
your 1
power 1
to 1
accomplish 1
She 1
then 1
returned 1
to 1
her 1
carriage 1
and 1
drove 1
to 1
the 1
golden 1
castle 1
of 1
Stromberg 1
When 1
the 1
man 1
awoke 1
and 1
found 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
sleeping 1
he 1
was 1
grieved 1
at 1
heart 1
and 1
said 1
She 1
has 1
no 1
doubt 1
been 1
here 1
and 1
driven 1
away 1
again 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
now 1
too 1
late 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
save 1
her 1
Then 1
his 1
eyes 1
fell 1
on 1
the 1
things 1
which 1
were 1
lying 1
beside 1
him 1
he 1
read 1
the 1
letter 1
and 1
knew 1
from 1
it 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
happened 1
He 1
rose 1
up 1
without 1
delay 1
eager 1
to 1
start 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
and 1
to 1
reach 1
the 1
castle 1
of 1
Stromberg 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
in 1
which 1
direction 1
he 1
ought 1
to 1
go 1
He 1
travelled 1
about 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
came 1
at 1
last 1
to 1
a 1
dark 1
forest 1
through 1
which 1
he 1
went 1
on 1
walking 1
for 1
fourteen 1
days 1
and 1
still 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
a 1
way 1
out 1
Once 1
more 1
the 1
night 1
came 1
on 1
and 1
worn 1
out 1
he 1
lay 1
down 1
under 1
a 1
bush 1
and 1
fell 1
asleep 1
Again 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
he 1
pursued 1
his 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
that 1
evening 1
thinking 1
to 1
rest 1
again 1
he 1
lay 1
down 1
as 1
before 1
but 1
he 1
heard 1
such 1
a 1
howling 1
and 1
wailing 1
that 1
he 1
found 1
it 1
impossible 1
to 1
sleep 1
He 1
waited 1
till 1
it 1
was 1
darker 1
and 1
people 1
had 1
begun 1
to 1
light 1
up 1
their 1
houses 1
and 1
then 1
seeing 1
a 1
little 1
glimmer 1
ahead 1
of 1
him 1
he 1
went 1
towards 1
it 1
He 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
light 1
came 1
from 1
a 1
house 1
which 1
looked 1
smaller 1
than 1
it 1
really 1
was 1
from 1
the 1
contrast 1
of 1
its 1
height 1
with 1
that 1
of 1
an 1
immense 1
giant 1
who 1
stood 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
it 1
He 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
If 1
the 1
giant 1
sees 1
me 1
going 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
worth 1
much 1
However 1
after 1
a 1
while 1
he 1
summoned 1
up 1
courage 1
and 1
went 1
forward 1
When 1
the 1
giant 1
saw 1
him 1
he 1
called 1
out 1
It 1
is 1
lucky 1
for 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
come 1
for 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
had 1
anything 1
to 1
eat 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
I 1
can 1
have 1
you 1
now 1
for 1
my 1
supper 1
I 1
would 1
rather 1
you 1
let 1
that 1
alone 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
for 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
willingly 1
give 1
myself 1
up 1
to 1
be 1
eaten 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
wanting 1
food 1
I 1
have 1
enough 1
to 1
satisfy 1
your 1
hunger 1
If 1
that 1
is 1
so 1
replied 1
the 1
giant 1
I 1
will 1
leave 1
you 1
in 1
peace 1
I 1
only 1
thought 1
of 1
eating 1
you 1
because 1
I 1
had 1
nothing 1
else 1
So 1
they 1
went 1
indoors 1
together 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
the 1
man 1
brought 1
out 1
the 1
bread 1
meat 1
and 1
wine 1
which 1
although 1
he 1
had 1
eaten 1
and 1
drunk 1
of 1
them 1
were 1
still 1
unconsumed 1
The 1
giant 1
was 1
pleased 1
with 1
the 1
good 1
cheer 1
and 1
ate 1
and 1
drank 1
to 1
his 1
heart 1
s 1
content 1
When 1
he 1
had 1
finished 1
his 1
supper 1
the 1
man 1
asked 1
him 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
direct 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
castle 1
of 1
Stromberg 1
The 1
giant 1
said 1
I 1
will 1
look 1
on 1
my 1
map 1
on 1
it 1
are 1
marked 1
all 1
the 1
towns 1
villages 1
and 1
houses 1
So 1
he 1
fetched 1
his 1
map 1
and 1
looked 1
for 1
the 1
castle 1
but 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
it 1
Never 1
mind 1
he 1
said 1
I 1
have 1
larger 1
maps 1
upstairs 1
in 1
the 1
cupboard 1
we 1
will 1
look 1
on 1
those 1
but 1
they 1
searched 1
in 1
vain 1
for 1
the 1
castle 1
was 1
not 1
marked 1
even 1
on 1
these 1
The 1
man 1
now 1
thought 1
he 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
continue 1
his 1
journey 1
but 1
the 1
giant 1
begged 1
him 1
to 1
remain 1
for 1
a 1
day 1
or 1
two 1
longer 1
until 1
the 1
return 1
of 1
his 1
brother 1
who 1
was 1
away 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
provisions 1
When 1
the 1
brother 1
came 1
home 1
they 1
asked 1
him 1
about 1
the 1
castle 1
of 1
Stromberg 1
and 1
he 1
told 1
them 1
he 1
would 1
look 1
on 1
his 1
own 1
maps 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
eaten 1
and 1
appeased 1
his 1
hunger 1
Accordingly 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
finished 1
his 1
supper 1
they 1
all 1
went 1
up 1
together 1
to 1
his 1
room 1
and 1
looked 1
through 1
his 1
maps 1
but 1
the 1
castle 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
Then 1
he 1
fetched 1
other 1
older 1
maps 1
and 1
they 1
went 1
on 1
looking 1
for 1
the 1
castle 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
found 1
it 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
many 1
thousand 1
miles 1
away 1
How 1
shall 1
I 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
get 1
there 1
asked 1
the 1
man 1
I 1
have 1
two 1
hours 1
to 1
spare 1
said 1
the 1
giant 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
carry 1
you 1
into 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
the 1
castle 1
I 1
must 1
then 1
return 1
to 1
look 1
after 1
the 1
child 1
who 1
is 1
in 1
our 1
care 1
The 1
giant 1
thereupon 1
carried 1
the 1
man 1
to 1
within 1
about 1
a 1
hundred 1
leagues 1
of 1
the 1
castle 1
where 1
he 1
left 1
him 1
saying 1
You 1
will 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
walk 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
yourself 1
The 1
man 1
journeyed 1
on 1
day 1
and 1
night 1
till 1
he 1
reached 1
the 1
golden 1
castle 1
of 1
Stromberg 1
He 1
found 1
it 1
situated 1
however 1
on 1
a 1
glass 1
mountain 1
and 1
looking 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
foot 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
enchanted 1
maiden 1
drive 1
round 1
her 1
castle 1
and 1
then 1
go 1
inside 1
He 1
was 1
overjoyed 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
and 1
longed 1
to 1
get 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
mountain 1
but 1
the 1
sides 1
were 1
so 1
slippery 1
that 1
every 1
time 1
he 1
attempted 1
to 1
climb 1
he 1
fell 1
back 1
again 1
When 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
to 1
reach 1
her 1
he 1
was 1
greatly 1
grieved 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
I 1
will 1
remain 1
here 1
and 1
wait 1
for 1
her 1
so 1
he 1
built 1
himself 1
a 1
little 1
hut 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
sat 1
and 1
watched 1
for 1
a 1
whole 1
year 1
and 1
every 1
day 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
driving 1
round 1
her 1
castle 1
but 1
still 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
get 1
nearer 1
to 1
her 1
Looking 1
out 1
from 1
his 1
hut 1
one 1
day 1
he 1
saw 1
three 1
robbers 1
fighting 1
and 1
he 1
called 1
out 1
to 1
them 1
God 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
They 1
stopped 1
when 1
they 1
heard 1
the 1
call 1
but 1
looking 1
round 1
and 1
seeing 1
nobody 1
they 1
went 1
on 1
again 1
with 1
their 1
fighting 1
which 1
now 1
became 1
more 1
furious 1
God 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
he 1
cried 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
they 1
paused 1
and 1
looked 1
about 1
but 1
seeing 1
no 1
one 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
their 1
fighting 1
A 1
third 1
time 1
he 1
called 1
out 1
God 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
then 1
thinking 1
he 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
know 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
dispute 1
between 1
the 1
three 1
men 1
he 1
went 1
out 1
and 1
asked 1
them 1
why 1
they 1
were 1
fighting 1
so 1
angrily 1
with 1
one 1
another 1
One 1
of 1
them 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
found 1
a 1
stick 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
but 1
to 1
strike 1
it 1
against 1
any 1
door 1
through 1
which 1
he 1
wished 1
to 1
pass 1
and 1
it 1
immediately 1
flew 1
open 1
Another 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
found 1
a 1
cloak 1
which 1
rendered 1
its 1
wearer 1
invisible 1
and 1
the 1
third 1
had 1
caught 1
a 1
horse 1
which 1
would 1
carry 1
its 1
rider 1
over 1
any 1
obstacle 1
and 1
even 1
up 1
the 1
glass 1
mountain 1
They 1
had 1
been 1
unable 1
to 1
decide 1
whether 1
they 1
would 1
keep 1
together 1
and 1
have 1
the 1
things 1
in 1
common 1
or 1
whether 1
they 1
would 1
separate 1
On 1
hearing 1
this 1
the 1
man 1
said 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
something 1
in 1
exchange 1
for 1
those 1
three 1
things 1
not 1
money 1
for 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
got 1
but 1
something 1
that 1
is 1
of 1
far 1
more 1
value 1
I 1
must 1
first 1
however 1
prove 1
whether 1
all 1
you 1
have 1
told 1
me 1
about 1
your 1
three 1
things 1
is 1
true 1
The 1
robbers 1
therefore 1
made 1
him 1
get 1
on 1
the 1
horse 1
and 1
handed 1
him 1
the 1
stick 1
and 1
the 1
cloak 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
put 1
this 1
round 1
him 1
he 1
was 1
no 1
longer 1
visible 1
Then 1
he 1
fell 1
upon 1
them 1
with 1
the 1
stick 1
and 1
beat 1
them 1
one 1
after 1
another 1
crying 1
There 1
you 1
idle 1
vagabonds 1
you 1
have 1
got 1
what 1
you 1
deserve 1
are 1
you 1
satisfied 1
now 1
After 1
this 1
he 1
rode 1
up 1
the 1
glass 1
mountain 1
When 1
he 1
reached 1
the 1
gate 1
of 1
the 1
castle 1
he 1
found 1
it 1
closed 1
but 1
he 1
gave 1
it 1
a 1
blow 1
with 1
his 1
stick 1
and 1
it 1
flew 1
wide 1
open 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
he 1
passed 1
through 1
He 1
mounted 1
the 1
steps 1
and 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
the 1
maiden 1
was 1
sitting 1
with 1
a 1
golden 1
goblet 1
full 1
of 1
wine 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
her 1
She 1
could 1
not 1
see 1
him 1
for 1
he 1
still 1
wore 1
his 1
cloak 1
He 1
took 1
the 1
ring 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
given 1
him 1
off 1
his 1
finger 1
and 1
threw 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
goblet 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
rang 1
as 1
it 1
touched 1
the 1
bottom 1
That 1
is 1
my 1
own 1
ring 1
she 1
exclaimed 1
and 1
if 1
that 1
is 1
so 1
the 1
man 1
must 1
also 1
be 1
here 1
who 1
is 1
coming 1
to 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
She 1
sought 1
for 1
him 1
about 1
the 1
castle 1
but 1
could 1
find 1
him 1
nowhere 1
Meanwhile 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
outside 1
again 1
and 1
mounted 1
his 1
horse 1
and 1
thrown 1
off 1
the 1
cloak 1
When 1
therefore 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
castle 1
gate 1
she 1
saw 1
him 1
and 1
cried 1
aloud 1
for 1
joy 1
Then 1
he 1
dismounted 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
in 1
his 1
arms 1
and 1
she 1
kissed 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
Now 1
you 1
have 1
indeed 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
and 1
tomorrow 1
we 1
will 1
celebrate 1
our 1
marriage 1
THE 1
GOLDEN 1
GOOSE 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
three 1
sons 1
the 1
youngest 1
of 1
whom 1
was 1
called 1
Dummling 1
and 1
was 1
despised 1
mocked 1
and 1
sneered 1
at 1
on 1
every 1
occasion 1
It 1
happened 1
that 1
the 1
eldest 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
to 1
hew 1
wood 1
and 1
before 1
he 1
went 1
his 1
mother 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
beautiful 1
sweet 1
cake 1
and 1
a 1
bottle 1
of 1
wine 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
not 1
suffer 1
from 1
hunger 1
or 1
thirst 1
When 1
he 1
entered 1
the 1
forest 1
he 1
met 1
a 1
little 1
grey 1
haired 1
old 1
man 1
who 1
bade 1
him 1
good 1
day 1
and 1
said 1
Do 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
cake 1
out 1
of 1
your 1
pocket 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
a 1
draught 1
of 1
your 1
wine 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
hungry 1
and 1
thirsty 1
But 1
the 1
clever 1
son 1
answered 1
If 1
I 1
give 1
you 1
my 1
cake 1
and 1
wine 1
I 1
shall 1
have 1
none 1
for 1
myself 1
be 1
off 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
he 1
left 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
standing 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
But 1
when 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
hew 1
down 1
a 1
tree 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
false 1
stroke 1
and 1
the 1
axe 1
cut 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
arm 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
have 1
it 1
bound 1
up 1
And 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
little 1
grey 1
man 1
s 1
doing 1
After 1
this 1
the 1
second 1
son 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
his 1
mother 1
gave 1
him 1
like 1
the 1
eldest 1
a 1
cake 1
and 1
a 1
bottle 1
of 1
wine 1
The 1
little 1
old 1
grey 1
man 1
met 1
him 1
likewise 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
for 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
cake 1
and 1
a 1
drink 1
of 1
wine 1
But 1
the 1
second 1
son 1
too 1
said 1
sensibly 1
enough 1
What 1
I 1
give 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
taken 1
away 1
from 1
myself 1
be 1
off 1
and 1
he 1
left 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
standing 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
His 1
punishment 1
however 1
was 1
not 1
delayed 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
made 1
a 1
few 1
blows 1
at 1
the 1
tree 1
he 1
struck 1
himself 1
in 1
the 1
leg 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
carried 1
home 1
Then 1
Dummling 1
said 1
Father 1
do 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
and 1
cut 1
wood 1
The 1
father 1
answered 1
Your 1
brothers 1
have 1
hurt 1
themselves 1
with 1
it 1
leave 1
it 1
alone 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
understand 1
anything 1
about 1
it 1
But 1
Dummling 1
begged 1
so 1
long 1
that 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
said 1
Just 1
go 1
then 1
you 1
will 1
get 1
wiser 1
by 1
hurting 1
yourself 1
His 1
mother 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
cake 1
made 1
with 1
water 1
and 1
baked 1
in 1
the 1
cinders 1
and 1
with 1
it 1
a 1
bottle 1
of 1
sour 1
beer 1
When 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
forest 1
the 1
little 1
old 1
grey 1
man 1
met 1
him 1
likewise 1
and 1
greeting 1
him 1
said 1
Give 1
me 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
your 1
cake 1
and 1
a 1
drink 1
out 1
of 1
your 1
bottle 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
hungry 1
and 1
thirsty 1
Dummling 1
answered 1
I 1
have 1
only 1
cinder 1
cake 1
and 1
sour 1
beer 1
if 1
that 1
pleases 1
you 1
we 1
will 1
sit 1
down 1
and 1
eat 1
So 1
they 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
when 1
Dummling 1
pulled 1
out 1
his 1
cinder 1
cake 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
fine 1
sweet 1
cake 1
and 1
the 1
sour 1
beer 1
had 1
become 1
good 1
wine 1
So 1
they 1
ate 1
and 1
drank 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
said 1
Since 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
good 1
heart 1
and 1
are 1
willing 1
to 1
divide 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
good 1
luck 1
There 1
stands 1
an 1
old 1
tree 1
cut 1
it 1
down 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
something 1
at 1
the 1
roots 1
Then 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
took 1
leave 1
of 1
him 1
Dummling 1
went 1
and 1
cut 1
down 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
fell 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
goose 1
sitting 1
in 1
the 1
roots 1
with 1
feathers 1
of 1
pure 1
gold 1
He 1
lifted 1
her 1
up 1
and 1
taking 1
her 1
with 1
him 1
went 1
to 1
an 1
inn 1
where 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
would 1
stay 1
the 1
night 1
Now 1
the 1
host 1
had 1
three 1
daughters 1
who 1
saw 1
the 1
goose 1
and 1
were 1
curious 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
such 1
a 1
wonderful 1
bird 1
might 1
be 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
liked 1
to 1
have 1
one 1
of 1
its 1
golden 1
feathers 1
The 1
eldest 1
thought 1
I 1
shall 1
soon 1
find 1
an 1
opportunity 1
of 1
pulling 1
out 1
a 1
feather 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
Dummling 1
had 1
gone 1
out 1
she 1
seized 1
the 1
goose 1
by 1
the 1
wing 1
but 1
her 1
finger 1
and 1
hand 1
remained 1
sticking 1
fast 1
to 1
it 1
The 1
second 1
came 1
soon 1
afterwards 1
thinking 1
only 1
of 1
how 1
she 1
might 1
get 1
a 1
feather 1
for 1
herself 1
but 1
she 1
had 1
scarcely 1
touched 1
her 1
sister 1
than 1
she 1
was 1
held 1
fast 1
At 1
last 1
the 1
third 1
also 1
came 1
with 1
the 1
like 1
intent 1
and 1
the 1
others 1
screamed 1
out 1
Keep 1
away 1
for 1
goodness 1
sake 1
keep 1
away 1
But 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
understand 1
why 1
she 1
was 1
to 1
keep 1
away 1
The 1
others 1
are 1
there 1
she 1
thought 1
I 1
may 1
as 1
well 1
be 1
there 1
too 1
and 1
ran 1
to 1
them 1
but 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
touched 1
her 1
sister 1
she 1
remained 1
sticking 1
fast 1
to 1
her 1
So 1
they 1
had 1
to 1
spend 1
the 1
night 1
with 1
the 1
goose 1
The 1
next 1
morning 1
Dummling 1
took 1
the 1
goose 1
under 1
his 1
arm 1
and 1
set 1
out 1
without 1
troubling 1
himself 1
about 1
the 1
three 1
girls 1
who 1
were 1
hanging 1
on 1
to 1
it 1
They 1
were 1
obliged 1
to 1
run 1
after 1
him 1
continually 1
now 1
left 1
now 1
right 1
wherever 1
his 1
legs 1
took 1
him 1
In 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
fields 1
the 1
parson 1
met 1
them 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
procession 1
he 1
said 1
For 1
shame 1
you 1
good 1
for 1
nothing 1
girls 1
why 1
are 1
you 1
running 1
across 1
the 1
fields 1
after 1
this 1
young 1
man 1
Is 1
that 1
seemly 1
At 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
he 1
seized 1
the 1
youngest 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
pull 1
her 1
away 1
but 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
touched 1
her 1
he 1
likewise 1
stuck 1
fast 1
and 1
was 1
himself 1
obliged 1
to 1
run 1
behind 1
Before 1
long 1
the 1
sexton 1
came 1
by 1
and 1
saw 1
his 1
master 1
the 1
parson 1
running 1
behind 1
three 1
girls 1
He 1
was 1
astonished 1
at 1
this 1
and 1
called 1
out 1
Hi 1
your 1
reverence 1
whither 1
away 1
so 1
quickly 1
Do 1
not 1
forget 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
a 1
christening 1
today 1
and 1
running 1
after 1
him 1
he 1
took 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
sleeve 1
but 1
was 1
also 1
held 1
fast 1
to 1
it 1
Whilst 1
the 1
five 1
were 1
trotting 1
thus 1
one 1
behind 1
the 1
other 1
two 1
labourers 1
came 1
with 1
their 1
hoes 1
from 1
the 1
fields 1
the 1
parson 1
called 1
out 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
begged 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
set 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
sexton 1
free 1
But 1
they 1
had 1
scarcely 1
touched 1
the 1
sexton 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
held 1
fast 1
and 1
now 1
there 1
were 1
seven 1
of 1
them 1
running 1
behind 1
Dummling 1
and 1
the 1
goose 1
Soon 1
afterwards 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
city 1
where 1
a 1
king 1
ruled 1
who 1
had 1
a 1
daughter 1
who 1
was 1
so 1
serious 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
could 1
make 1
her 1
laugh 1
So 1
he 1
had 1
put 1
forth 1
a 1
decree 1
that 1
whosoever 1
should 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
make 1
her 1
laugh 1
should 1
marry 1
her 1
When 1
Dummling 1
heard 1
this 1
he 1
went 1
with 1
his 1
goose 1
and 1
all 1
her 1
train 1
before 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
seven 1
people 1
running 1
on 1
and 1
on 1
one 1
behind 1
the 1
other 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
laugh 1
quite 1
loudly 1
and 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
would 1
never 1
stop 1
Thereupon 1
Dummling 1
asked 1
to 1
have 1
her 1
for 1
his 1
wife 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
the 1
son 1
in 1
law 1
and 1
made 1
all 1
manner 1
of 1
excuses 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
must 1
first 1
produce 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
could 1
drink 1
a 1
cellarful 1
of 1
wine 1
Dummling 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
grey 1
man 1
who 1
could 1
certainly 1
help 1
him 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
place 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
felled 1
the 1
tree 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
man 1
sitting 1
who 1
had 1
a 1
very 1
sorrowful 1
face 1
Dummling 1
asked 1
him 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
taking 1
to 1
heart 1
so 1
sorely 1
and 1
he 1
answered 1
I 1
have 1
such 1
a 1
great 1
thirst 1
and 1
cannot 1
quench 1
it 1
cold 1
water 1
I 1
cannot 1
stand 1
a 1
barrel 1
of 1
wine 1
I 1
have 1
just 1
emptied 1
but 1
that 1
to 1
me 1
is 1
like 1
a 1
drop 1
on 1
a 1
hot 1
stone 1
There 1
I 1
can 1
help 1
you 1
said 1
Dummling 1
just 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
be 1
satisfied 1
He 1
led 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
cellar 1
and 1
the 1
man 1
bent 1
over 1
the 1
huge 1
barrels 1
and 1
drank 1
and 1
drank 1
till 1
his 1
loins 1
hurt 1
and 1
before 1
the 1
day 1
was 1
out 1
he 1
had 1
emptied 1
all 1
the 1
barrels 1
Then 1
Dummling 1
asked 1
once 1
more 1
for 1
his 1
bride 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
was 1
vexed 1
that 1
such 1
an 1
ugly 1
fellow 1
whom 1
everyone 1
called 1
Dummling 1
should 1
take 1
away 1
his 1
daughter 1
and 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
new 1
condition 1
he 1
must 1
first 1
find 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
could 1
eat 1
a 1
whole 1
mountain 1
of 1
bread 1
Dummling 1
did 1
not 1
think 1
long 1
but 1
went 1
straight 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
where 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
place 1
there 1
sat 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
tying 1
up 1
his 1
body 1
with 1
a 1
strap 1
and 1
making 1
an 1
awful 1
face 1
and 1
saying 1
I 1
have 1
eaten 1
a 1
whole 1
ovenful 1
of 1
rolls 1
but 1
what 1
good 1
is 1
that 1
when 1
one 1
has 1
such 1
a 1
hunger 1
as 1
I 1
My 1
stomach 1
remains 1
empty 1
and 1
I 1
must 1
tie 1
myself 1
up 1
if 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
to 1
die 1
of 1
hunger 1
At 1
this 1
Dummling 1
was 1
glad 1
and 1
said 1
Get 1
up 1
and 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
you 1
shall 1
eat 1
yourself 1
full 1
He 1
led 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
palace 1
where 1
all 1
the 1
flour 1
in 1
the 1
whole 1
Kingdom 1
was 1
collected 1
and 1
from 1
it 1
he 1
caused 1
a 1
huge 1
mountain 1
of 1
bread 1
to 1
be 1
baked 1
The 1
man 1
from 1
the 1
forest 1
stood 1
before 1
it 1
began 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
one 1
day 1
the 1
whole 1
mountain 1
had 1
vanished 1
Then 1
Dummling 1
for 1
the 1
third 1
time 1
asked 1
for 1
his 1
bride 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
again 1
sought 1
a 1
way 1
out 1
and 1
ordered 1
a 1
ship 1
which 1
could 1
sail 1
on 1
land 1
and 1
on 1
water 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
you 1
come 1
sailing 1
back 1
in 1
it 1
said 1
he 1
you 1
shall 1
have 1
my 1
daughter 1
for 1
wife 1
Dummling 1
went 1
straight 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
there 1
sat 1
the 1
little 1
grey 1
man 1
to 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
given 1
his 1
cake 1
When 1
he 1
heard 1
what 1
Dummling 1
wanted 1
he 1
said 1
Since 1
you 1
have 1
given 1
me 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
to 1
drink 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
the 1
ship 1
and 1
I 1
do 1
all 1
this 1
because 1
you 1
once 1
were 1
kind 1
to 1
me 1
Then 1
he 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
ship 1
which 1
could 1
sail 1
on 1
land 1
and 1
water 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
saw 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
prevent 1
him 1
from 1
having 1
his 1
daughter 1
The 1
wedding 1
was 1
celebrated 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
death 1
Dummling 1
inherited 1
his 1
kingdom 1
and 1
lived 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
contentedly 1
with 1
his 1
wife 1
Simpleton 1
THE 1
WATER 1
OF 1
LIFE 1
Long 1
before 1
you 1
or 1
I 1
were 1
born 1
there 1
reigned 1
in 1
a 1
country 1
a 1
great 1
way 1
off 1
a 1
king 1
who 1
had 1
three 1
sons 1
This 1
king 1
once 1
fell 1
very 1
ill 1
so 1
ill 1
that 1
nobody 1
thought 1
he 1
could 1
live 1
His 1
sons 1
were 1
very 1
much 1
grieved 1
at 1
their 1
father 1
s 1
sickness 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
walking 1
together 1
very 1
mournfully 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
of 1
the 1
palace 1
a 1
little 1
old 1
man 1
met 1
them 1
and 1
asked 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
matter 1
They 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
their 1
father 1
was 1
very 1
ill 1
and 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
afraid 1
nothing 1
could 1
save 1
him 1
I 1
know 1
what 1
would 1
said 1
the 1
little 1
old 1
man 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
Water 1
of 1
Life 1
If 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
a 1
draught 1
of 1
it 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
well 1
again 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
hard 1
to 1
get 1
Then 1
the 1
eldest 1
son 1
said 1
I 1
will 1
soon 1
find 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
sick 1
king 1
and 1
begged 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
go 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
the 1
Water 1
of 1
Life 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
that 1
could 1
save 1
him 1
No 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
I 1
had 1
rather 1
die 1
than 1
place 1
you 1
in 1
such 1
great 1
danger 1
as 1
you 1
must 1
meet 1
with 1
in 1
your 1
journey 1
But 1
he 1
begged 1
so 1
hard 1
that 1
the 1
king 1
let 1
him 1
go 1
and 1
the 1
prince 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
If 1
I 1
bring 1
my 1
father 1
this 1
water 1
he 1
will 1
make 1
me 1
sole 1
heir 1
to 1
his 1
kingdom 1
Then 1
he 1
set 1
out 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
some 1
time 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
deep 1
valley 1
overhung 1
with 1
rocks 1
and 1
woods 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
around 1
he 1
saw 1
standing 1
above 1
him 1
on 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
rocks 1
a 1
little 1
ugly 1
dwarf 1
with 1
a 1
sugarloaf 1
cap 1
and 1
a 1
scarlet 1
cloak 1
and 1
the 1
dwarf 1
called 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
Prince 1
whither 1
so 1
fast 1
What 1
is 1
that 1
to 1
thee 1
you 1
ugly 1
imp 1
said 1
the 1
prince 1
haughtily 1
and 1
rode 1
on 1
But 1
the 1
dwarf 1
was 1
enraged 1
at 1
his 1
behaviour 1
and 1
laid 1
a 1
fairy 1
spell 1
of 1
ill 1
luck 1
upon 1
him 1
so 1
that 1
as 1
he 1
rode 1
on 1
the 1
mountain 1
pass 1
became 1
narrower 1
and 1
narrower 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
way 1
was 1
so 1
straitened 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
go 1
to 1
step 1
forward 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
thought 1
to 1
have 1
turned 1
his 1
horse 1
round 1
and 1
go 1
back 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
came 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
loud 1
laugh 1
ringing 1
round 1
him 1
and 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
path 1
was 1
closed 1
behind 1
him 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
shut 1
in 1
all 1
round 1
He 1
next 1
tried 1
to 1
get 1
off 1
his 1
horse 1
and 1
make 1
his 1
way 1
on 1
foot 1
but 1
again 1
the 1
laugh 1
rang 1
in 1
his 1
ears 1
and 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
unable 1
to 1
move 1
a 1
step 1
and 1
thus 1
he 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
abide 1
spellbound 1
Meantime 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
was 1
lingering 1
on 1
in 1
daily 1
hope 1
of 1
his 1
son 1
s 1
return 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
second 1
son 1
said 1
Father 1
I 1
will 1
go 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
the 1
Water 1
of 1
Life 1
For 1
he 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
My 1
brother 1
is 1
surely 1
dead 1
and 1
the 1
kingdom 1
will 1
fall 1
to 1
me 1
if 1
I 1
find 1
the 1
water 1
The 1
king 1
was 1
at 1
first 1
very 1
unwilling 1
to 1
let 1
him 1
go 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
yielded 1
to 1
his 1
wish 1
So 1
he 1
set 1
out 1
and 1
followed 1
the 1
same 1
road 1
which 1
his 1
brother 1
had 1
done 1
and 1
met 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
elf 1
who 1
stopped 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
spot 1
in 1
the 1
mountains 1
saying 1
as 1
before 1
Prince 1
prince 1
whither 1
so 1
fast 1
Mind 1
your 1
own 1
affairs 1
busybody 1
said 1
the 1
prince 1
scornfully 1
and 1
rode 1
on 1
But 1
the 1
dwarf 1
put 1
the 1
same 1
spell 1
upon 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
put 1
on 1
his 1
elder 1
brother 1
and 1
he 1
too 1
was 1
at 1
last 1
obliged 1
to 1
take 1
up 1
his 1
abode 1
in 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
the 1
mountains 1
Thus 1
it 1
is 1
with 1
proud 1
silly 1
people 1
who 1
think 1
themselves 1
above 1
everyone 1
else 1
and 1
are 1
too 1
proud 1
to 1
ask 1
or 1
take 1
advice 1
When 1
the 1
second 1
prince 1
had 1
thus 1
been 1
gone 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
the 1
youngest 1
son 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
go 1
and 1
search 1
for 1
the 1
Water 1
of 1
Life 1
and 1
trusted 1
he 1
should 1
soon 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
make 1
his 1
father 1
well 1
again 1
So 1
he 1
set 1
out 1
and 1
the 1
dwarf 1
met 1
him 1
too 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
spot 1
in 1
the 1
valley 1
among 1
the 1
mountains 1
and 1
said 1
Prince 1
whither 1
so 1
fast 1
And 1
the 1
prince 1
said 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
the 1
Water 1
of 1
Life 1
because 1
my 1
father 1
is 1
ill 1
and 1
like 1
to 1
die 1
can 1
you 1
help 1
me 1
Pray 1
be 1
kind 1
and 1
aid 1
me 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
Do 1
you 1
know 1
where 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
asked 1
the 1
dwarf 1
No 1
said 1
the 1
prince 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
Pray 1
tell 1
me 1
if 1
you 1
know 1
Then 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
spoken 1
to 1
me 1
kindly 1
and 1
are 1
wise 1
enough 1
to 1
seek 1
for 1
advice 1
I 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
how 1
and 1
where 1
to 1
go 1
The 1
water 1
you 1
seek 1
springs 1
from 1
a 1
well 1
in 1
an 1
enchanted 1
castle 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
reach 1
it 1
in 1
safety 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
an 1
iron 1
wand 1
and 1
two 1
little 1
loaves 1
of 1
bread 1
strike 1
the 1
iron 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
castle 1
three 1
times 1
with 1
the 1
wand 1
and 1
it 1
will 1
open 1
two 1
hungry 1
lions 1
will 1
be 1
lying 1
down 1
inside 1
gaping 1
for 1
their 1
prey 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
throw 1
them 1
the 1
bread 1
they 1
will 1
let 1
you 1
pass 1
then 1
hasten 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
take 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
Water 1
of 1
Life 1
before 1
the 1
clock 1
strikes 1
twelve 1
for 1
if 1
you 1
tarry 1
longer 1
the 1
door 1
will 1
shut 1
upon 1
you 1
for 1
ever 1
Then 1
the 1
prince 1
thanked 1
his 1
little 1
friend 1
with 1
the 1
scarlet 1
cloak 1
for 1
his 1
friendly 1
aid 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
wand 1
and 1
the 1
bread 1
and 1
went 1
travelling 1
on 1
and 1
on 1
over 1
sea 1
and 1
over 1
land 1
till 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
his 1
journey 1
s 1
end 1
and 1
found 1
everything 1
to 1
be 1
as 1
the 1
dwarf 1
had 1
told 1
him 1
The 1
door 1
flew 1
open 1
at 1
the 1
third 1
stroke 1
of 1
the 1
wand 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
lions 1
were 1
quieted 1
he 1
went 1
on 1
through 1
the 1
castle 1
and 1
came 1
at 1
length 1
to 1
a 1
beautiful 1
hall 1
Around 1
it 1
he 1
saw 1
several 1
knights 1
sitting 1
in 1
a 1
trance 1
then 1
he 1
pulled 1
off 1
their 1
rings 1
and 1
put 1
them 1
on 1
his 1
own 1
fingers 1
In 1
another 1
room 1
he 1
saw 1
on 1
a 1
table 1
a 1
sword 1
and 1
a 1
loaf 1
of 1
bread 1
which 1
he 1
also 1
took 1
Further 1
on 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
room 1
where 1
a 1
beautiful 1
young 1
lady 1
sat 1
upon 1
a 1
couch 1
and 1
she 1
welcomed 1
him 1
joyfully 1
and 1
said 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
set 1
her 1
free 1
from 1
the 1
spell 1
that 1
bound 1
her 1
the 1
kingdom 1
should 1
be 1
his 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
come 1
back 1
in 1
a 1
year 1
and 1
marry 1
her 1
Then 1
she 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
well 1
that 1
held 1
the 1
Water 1
of 1
Life 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
palace 1
gardens 1
and 1
bade 1
him 1
make 1
haste 1
and 1
draw 1
what 1
he 1
wanted 1
before 1
the 1
clock 1
struck 1
twelve 1
He 1
walked 1
on 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
walked 1
through 1
beautiful 1
gardens 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
delightful 1
shady 1
spot 1
in 1
which 1
stood 1
a 1
couch 1
and 1
he 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
as 1
he 1
felt 1
tired 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
rest 1
himself 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
gaze 1
on 1
the 1
lovely 1
scenes 1
around 1
him 1
So 1
he 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
and 1
sleep 1
fell 1
upon 1
him 1
unawares 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
wake 1
up 1
till 1
the 1
clock 1
was 1
striking 1
a 1
quarter 1
to 1
twelve 1
Then 1
he 1
sprang 1
from 1
the 1
couch 1
dreadfully 1
frightened 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
well 1
filled 1
a 1
cup 1
that 1
was 1
standing 1
by 1
him 1
full 1
of 1
water 1
and 1
hastened 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
in 1
time 1
Just 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
iron 1
door 1
it 1
struck 1
twelve 1
and 1
the 1
door 1
fell 1
so 1
quickly 1
upon 1
him 1
that 1
it 1
snapped 1
off 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
his 1
heel 1
When 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
safe 1
he 1
was 1
overjoyed 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
got 1
the 1
Water 1
of 1
Life 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
homewards 1
he 1
passed 1
by 1
the 1
little 1
dwarf 1
who 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
sword 1
and 1
the 1
loaf 1
said 1
You 1
have 1
made 1
a 1
noble 1
prize 1
with 1
the 1
sword 1
you 1
can 1
at 1
a 1
blow 1
slay 1
whole 1
armies 1
and 1
the 1
bread 1
will 1
never 1
fail 1
you 1
Then 1
the 1
prince 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
I 1
cannot 1
go 1
home 1
to 1
my 1
father 1
without 1
my 1
brothers 1
so 1
he 1
said 1
My 1
dear 1
friend 1
cannot 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
where 1
my 1
two 1
brothers 1
are 1
who 1
set 1
out 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
the 1
Water 1
of 1
Life 1
before 1
me 1
and 1
never 1
came 1
back 1
I 1
have 1
shut 1
them 1
up 1
by 1
a 1
charm 1
between 1
two 1
mountains 1
said 1
the 1
dwarf 1
because 1
they 1
were 1
proud 1
and 1
ill 1
behaved 1
and 1
scorned 1
to 1
ask 1
advice 1
The 1
prince 1
begged 1
so 1
hard 1
for 1
his 1
brothers 1
that 1
the 1
dwarf 1
at 1
last 1
set 1
them 1
free 1
though 1
unwillingly 1
saying 1
Beware 1
of 1
them 1
for 1
they 1
have 1
bad 1
hearts 1
Their 1
brother 1
however 1
was 1
greatly 1
rejoiced 1
to 1
see 1
them 1
and 1
told 1
them 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
happened 1
to 1
him 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
found 1
the 1
Water 1
of 1
Life 1
and 1
had 1
taken 1
a 1
cup 1
full 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
set 1
a 1
beautiful 1
princess 1
free 1
from 1
a 1
spell 1
that 1
bound 1
her 1
and 1
how 1
she 1
had 1
engaged 1
to 1
wait 1
a 1
whole 1
year 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
marry 1
him 1
and 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
the 1
kingdom 1
Then 1
they 1
all 1
three 1
rode 1
on 1
together 1
and 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
home 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
country 1
that 1
was 1
laid 1
waste 1
by 1
war 1
and 1
a 1
dreadful 1
famine 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
feared 1
all 1
must 1
die 1
for 1
want 1
But 1
the 1
prince 1
gave 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
the 1
land 1
the 1
bread 1
and 1
all 1
his 1
kingdom 1
ate 1
of 1
it 1
And 1
he 1
lent 1
the 1
king 1
the 1
wonderful 1
sword 1
and 1
he 1
slew 1
the 1
enemy 1
s 1
army 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
thus 1
the 1
kingdom 1
was 1
once 1
more 1
in 1
peace 1
and 1
plenty 1
In 1
the 1
same 1
manner 1
he 1
befriended 1
two 1
other 1
countries 1
through 1
which 1
they 1
passed 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
When 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
sea 1
they 1
got 1
into 1
a 1
ship 1
and 1
during 1
their 1
voyage 1
the 1
two 1
eldest 1
said 1
to 1
themselves 1
Our 1
brother 1
has 1
got 1
the 1
water 1
which 1
we 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
therefore 1
our 1
father 1
will 1
forsake 1
us 1
and 1
give 1
him 1
the 1
kingdom 1
which 1
is 1
our 1
right 1
so 1
they 1
were 1
full 1
of 1
envy 1
and 1
revenge 1
and 1
agreed 1
together 1
how 1
they 1
could 1
ruin 1
him 1
Then 1
they 1
waited 1
till 1
he 1
was 1
fast 1
asleep 1
and 1
poured 1
the 1
Water 1
of 1
Life 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
cup 1
and 1
took 1
it 1
for 1
themselves 1
giving 1
him 1
bitter 1
sea 1
water 1
instead 1
When 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
their 1
journey 1
s 1
end 1
the 1
youngest 1
son 1
brought 1
his 1
cup 1
to 1
the 1
sick 1
king 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
drink 1
and 1
be 1
healed 1
Scarcely 1
however 1
had 1
he 1
tasted 1
the 1
bitter 1
sea 1
water 1
when 1
he 1
became 1
worse 1
even 1
than 1
he 1
was 1
before 1
and 1
then 1
both 1
the 1
elder 1
sons 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
blamed 1
the 1
youngest 1
for 1
what 1
they 1
had 1
done 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
poison 1
their 1
father 1
but 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
found 1
the 1
Water 1
of 1
Life 1
and 1
had 1
brought 1
it 1
with 1
them 1
He 1
no 1
sooner 1
began 1
to 1
drink 1
of 1
what 1
they 1
brought 1
him 1
than 1
he 1
felt 1
his 1
sickness 1
leave 1
him 1
and 1
was 1
as 1
strong 1
and 1
well 1
as 1
in 1
his 1
younger 1
days 1
Then 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
their 1
brother 1
and 1
laughed 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
Well 1
brother 1
you 1
found 1
the 1
Water 1
of 1
Life 1
did 1
you 1
You 1
have 1
had 1
the 1
trouble 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
have 1
the 1
reward 1
Pray 1
with 1
all 1
your 1
cleverness 1
why 1
did 1
not 1
you 1
manage 1
to 1
keep 1
your 1
eyes 1
open 1
Next 1
year 1
one 1
of 1
us 1
will 1
take 1
away 1
your 1
beautiful 1
princess 1
if 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
take 1
care 1
You 1
had 1
better 1
say 1
nothing 1
about 1
this 1
to 1
our 1
father 1
for 1
he 1
does 1
not 1
believe 1
a 1
word 1
you 1
say 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
tell 1
tales 1
you 1
shall 1
lose 1
your 1
life 1
into 1
the 1
bargain 1
but 1
be 1
quiet 1
and 1
we 1
will 1
let 1
you 1
off 1
The 1
old 1
king 1
was 1
still 1
very 1
angry 1
with 1
his 1
youngest 1
son 1
and 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
really 1
meant 1
to 1
have 1
taken 1
away 1
his 1
life 1
so 1
he 1
called 1
his 1
court 1
together 1
and 1
asked 1
what 1
should 1
be 1
done 1
and 1
all 1
agreed 1
that 1
he 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
put 1
to 1
death 1
The 1
prince 1
knew 1
nothing 1
of 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
till 1
one 1
day 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
chief 1
huntsmen 1
went 1
a 1
hunting 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
together 1
the 1
huntsman 1
looked 1
so 1
sorrowful 1
that 1
the 1
prince 1
said 1
My 1
friend 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
matter 1
with 1
you 1
I 1
cannot 1
and 1
dare 1
not 1
tell 1
you 1
said 1
he 1
But 1
the 1
prince 1
begged 1
very 1
hard 1
and 1
said 1
Only 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
angry 1
for 1
I 1
will 1
forgive 1
you 1
Alas 1
said 1
the 1
huntsman 1
the 1
king 1
has 1
ordered 1
me 1
to 1
shoot 1
you 1
The 1
prince 1
started 1
at 1
this 1
and 1
said 1
Let 1
me 1
live 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
change 1
dresses 1
with 1
you 2
shall 1
take 1
my 1
royal 1
coat 1
to 1
show 1
to 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
do 1
you 1
give 1
me 1
your 1
shabby 1
one 1
With 1
all 1
my 1
heart 1
said 1
the 1
huntsman 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
glad 1
to 1
save 1
you 1
for 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
shot 1
you 1
Then 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
prince 1
s 1
coat 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
shabby 1
one 1
and 1
went 1
away 1
through 1
the 1
wood 1
Some 1
time 1
after 1
three 1
grand 1
embassies 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
s 1
court 1
with 1
rich 1
gifts 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
precious 1
stones 1
for 1
his 1
youngest 1
son 1
now 1
all 1
these 1
were 1
sent 1
from 1
the 1
three 1
kings 1
to 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
lent 1
his 1
sword 1
and 1
loaf 1
of 1
bread 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
rid 1
them 1
of 1
their 1
enemy 1
and 1
feed 1
their 1
people 1
This 1
touched 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
s 1
heart 1
and 1
he 1
thought 1
his 1
son 1
might 1
still 1
be 1
guiltless 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
his 1
court 1
O 1
that 1
my 1
son 1
were 1
still 1
alive 1
how 1
it 1
grieves 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
him 1
killed 1
He 1
is 1
still 1
alive 1
said 1
the 1
huntsman 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
glad 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
pity 1
on 1
him 1
but 1
let 1
him 1
go 1
in 1
peace 1
and 1
brought 1
home 1
his 1
royal 1
coat 1
At 1
this 1
the 1
king 1
was 1
overwhelmed 1
with 1
joy 1
and 1
made 1
it 1
known 1
throughout 1
all 1
his 1
kingdom 1
that 1
if 1
his 1
son 1
would 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
court 1
he 1
would 1
forgive 1
him 1
Meanwhile 1
the 1
princess 1
was 1
eagerly 1
waiting 1
till 1
her 1
deliverer 1
should 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
road 1
made 1
leading 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
palace 1
all 1
of 1
shining 1
gold 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
courtiers 1
that 1
whoever 1
came 1
on 1
horseback 1
and 1
rode 1
straight 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
gate 1
upon 1
it 1
was 1
her 1
true 1
lover 1
and 1
that 1
they 1
must 1
let 1
him 1
in 1
but 1
whoever 1
rode 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
it 1
they 1
must 1
be 1
sure 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
right 1
one 1
and 1
that 1
they 1
must 1
send 1
him 1
away 1
at 1
once 1
The 1
time 1
soon 1
came 1
when 1
the 1
eldest 1
brother 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
make 1
haste 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
princess 1
and 1
say 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
one 1
who 1
had 1
set 1
her 1
free 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
have 1
her 1
for 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
the 1
kingdom 1
with 1
her 1
As 1
he 1
came 1
before 1
the 1
palace 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
golden 1
road 1
he 1
stopped 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
pity 1
to 1
ride 1
upon 1
this 1
beautiful 1
road 1
so 1
he 1
turned 1
aside 1
and 1
rode 1
on 1
the 1
right 1
hand 1
side 1
of 1
it 1
But 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
gate 1
the 1
guards 1
who 1
had 1
seen 1
the 1
road 1
he 1
took 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
what 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
and 1
must 1
go 1
about 1
his 1
business 1
The 1
second 1
prince 1
set 1
out 1
soon 1
afterwards 1
on 1
the 1
same 1
errand 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
golden 1
road 1
and 1
his 1
horse 1
had 1
set 1
one 1
foot 1
upon 1
it 1
he 1
stopped 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
thought 1
it 1
very 1
beautiful 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
What 1
a 1
pity 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
anything 1
should 1
tread 1
here 1
Then 1
he 1
too 1
turned 1
aside 1
and 1
rode 1
on 1
the 1
left 1
side 1
of 1
it 1
But 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
gate 1
the 1
guards 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
true 1
prince 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
too 1
must 1
go 1
away 1
about 1
his 1
business 1
and 1
away 1
he 1
went 1
Now 1
when 1
the 1
full 1
year 1
was 1
come 1
round 1
the 1
third 1
brother 1
left 1
the 1
forest 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
lain 1
hid 1
for 1
fear 1
of 1
his 1
father 1
s 1
anger 1
and 1
set 1
out 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
his 1
betrothed 1
bride 1
So 1
he 1
journeyed 1
on 1
thinking 1
of 1
her 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
and 1
rode 1
so 1
quickly 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
even 1
see 1
what 1
the 1
road 1
was 1
made 1
of 1
but 1
went 1
with 1
his 1
horse 1
straight 1
over 1
it 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
gate 1
it 1
flew 1
open 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
welcomed 1
him 1
with 1
joy 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
her 1
deliverer 1
and 1
should 1
now 1
be 1
her 1
husband 1
and 1
lord 1
of 1
the 1
kingdom 1
When 1
the 1
first 1
joy 1
at 1
their 1
meeting 1
was 1
over 1
the 1
princess 1
told 1
him 1
she 1
had 1
heard 1
of 1
his 1
father 1
having 1
forgiven 1
him 1
and 1
of 1
his 1
wish 1
to 1
have 1
him 1
home 1
again 1
so 1
before 1
his 1
wedding 1
with 1
the 1
princess 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
visit 1
his 1
father 1
taking 1
her 1
with 1
him 1
Then 1
he 1
told 1
him 1
everything 1
how 1
his 1
brothers 1
had 1
cheated 1
and 1
robbed 1
him 1
and 1
yet 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
borne 1
all 1
those 1
wrongs 1
for 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
his 1
father 1
And 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
was 1
very 1
angry 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
punish 1
his 1
wicked 1
sons 1
but 1
they 1
made 1
their 1
escape 1
and 1
got 1
into 1
a 1
ship 1
and 1
sailed 1
away 1
over 1
the 1
wide 1
sea 1
and 1
where 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
nobody 1
knew 1
and 1
nobody 1
cared 1
And 1
now 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
gathered 1
together 1
his 1
court 1
and 1
asked 1
all 1
his 1
kingdom 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
celebrate 1
the 1
wedding 1
of 1
his 1
son 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
And 1
young 1
and 1
old 1
noble 1
and 1
squire 1
gentle 1
and 1
simple 1
came 1
at 1
once 1
on 1
the 1
summons 1
and 1
among 1
the 1
rest 1
came 1
the 1
friendly 1
dwarf 1
with 1
the 1
sugarloaf 1
hat 1
and 1
a 1
new 1
scarlet 1
cloak 1
And 1
the 1
wedding 1
was 1
held 1
and 1
the 1
merry 1
bells 1
run 1
And 1
all 1
the 1
good 1
people 1
they 1
danced 1
and 1
they 1
sung 1
And 1
feasted 1
and 1
frolick 1
d 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
tell 1
how 1
long 1
THE 1
TWELVE 1
HUNTSMEN 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
who 1
had 1
a 1
bride 1
whom 1
he 1
loved 1
very 1
much 1
And 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
sitting 1
beside 1
her 1
and 1
very 1
happy 1
news 1
came 1
that 1
his 1
father 1
lay 1
sick 1
unto 1
death 1
and 1
desired 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
once 1
again 1
before 1
his 1
end 1
Then 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
his 1
beloved 1
I 1
must 1
now 1
go 1
and 1
leave 1
you 1
I 1
give 1
you 1
a 1
ring 1
as 1
a 1
remembrance 1
of 1
me 1
When 1
I 1
am 1
king 1
I 1
will 1
return 1
and 1
fetch 1
you 1
So 1
he 1
rode 1
away 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
reached 1
his 1
father 1
the 1
latter 1
was 1
dangerously 1
ill 1
and 1
near 1
his 1
death 1
He 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
Dear 1
son 1
I 1
wished 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
once 1
again 1
before 1
my 1
end 1
promise 1
me 1
to 1
marry 1
as 1
I 1
wish 1
and 1
he 1
named 1
a 1
certain 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
who 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
his 1
wife 1
The 1
son 1
was 1
in 1
such 1
trouble 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
think 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
doing 1
and 1
said 1
Yes 1
dear 1
father 1
your 1
will 1
shall 1
be 1
done 1
and 1
thereupon 1
the 1
king 1
shut 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
died 1
When 1
therefore 1
the 1
son 1
had 1
been 1
proclaimed 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
mourning 1
was 1
over 1
he 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
promise 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
given 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
caused 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
to 1
be 1
asked 1
in 1
marriage 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
promised 1
to 1
him 1
His 1
first 1
betrothed 1
heard 1
of 1
this 1
and 1
fretted 1
so 1
much 1
about 1
his 1
faithfulness 1
that 1
she 1
nearly 1
died 1
Then 1
her 1
father 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
Dearest 1
child 1
why 1
are 1
you 1
so 1
sad 1
You 1
shall 1
have 1
whatsoever 1
you 1
will 1
She 1
thought 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
said 1
Dear 1
father 1
I 1
wish 1
for 1
eleven 1
girls 1
exactly 1
like 1
myself 1
in 1
face 1
figure 1
and 1
size 1
The 1
father 1
said 1
If 1
it 1
be 1
possible 1
your 1
desire 1
shall 1
be 1
fulfilled 1
and 1
he 1
caused 1
a 1
search 1
to 1
be 1
made 1
in 1
his 1
whole 1
kingdom 1
until 1
eleven 1
young 1
maidens 1
were 1
found 1
who 1
exactly 1
resembled 1
his 1
daughter 1
in 1
face 1
figure 1
and 1
size 1
When 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
she 1
had 1
twelve 1
suits 1
of 1
huntsmen 1
s 1
clothes 1
made 1
all 1
alike 1
and 1
the 1
eleven 1
maidens 1
had 1
to 1
put 1
on 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
s 1
clothes 1
and 1
she 1
herself 1
put 1
on 1
the 1
twelfth 1
suit 1
Thereupon 1
she 1
took 1
her 1
leave 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
rode 1
away 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
rode 1
to 1
the 1
court 1
of 1
her 1
former 1
betrothed 1
whom 1
she 1
loved 1
so 1
dearly 1
Then 1
she 1
asked 1
if 1
he 1
required 1
any 1
huntsmen 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
take 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
into 1
his 1
service 1
The 1
king 1
looked 1
at 1
her 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
her 1
but 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
such 1
handsome 1
fellows 1
he 1
said 1
Yes 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
willingly 1
take 1
them 1
and 1
now 1
they 1
were 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
twelve 1
huntsmen 1
The 1
king 1
however 1
had 1
a 1
lion 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
wondrous 1
animal 1
for 1
he 1
knew 1
all 1
concealed 1
and 1
secret 1
things 1
It 1
came 1
to 1
pass 1
that 1
one 1
evening 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
You 1
think 1
you 1
have 1
twelve 1
huntsmen 1
Yes 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
they 1
are 1
twelve 1
huntsmen 1
The 1
lion 1
continued 1
You 1
are 1
mistaken 1
they 1
are 1
twelve 1
girls 1
The 1
king 1
said 1
That 1
cannot 1
be 1
true 1
How 1
will 1
you 1
prove 1
that 1
to 1
me 1
Oh 1
just 1
let 1
some 1
peas 1
be 1
strewn 1
in 1
the 1
ante 1
chamber 1
answered 1
the 1
lion 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
will 1
soon 1
see 1
Men 1
have 1
a 1
firm 1
step 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
walk 1
over 1
peas 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
stir 1
but 1
girls 1
trip 1
and 1
skip 1
and 1
drag 1
their 1
feet 1
and 1
the 1
peas 1
roll 1
about 1
The 1
king 1
was 1
well 1
pleased 1
with 1
the 1
counsel 1
and 1
caused 1
the 1
peas 1
to 1
be 1
strewn 1
There 1
was 1
however 1
a 1
servant 1
of 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
who 1
favoured 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
put 1
to 1
this 1
test 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
repeated 1
everything 1
and 1
said 1
The 1
lion 1
wants 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
king 1
believe 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
girls 1
Then 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
thanked 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
maidens 1
Show 1
some 1
strength 1
and 1
step 1
firmly 1
on 1
the 1
peas 1
So 1
next 1
morning 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
had 1
the 1
twelve 1
huntsmen 1
called 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
they 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
ante 1
chamber 1
where 1
the 1
peas 1
were 1
lying 1
they 1
stepped 1
so 1
firmly 1
on 1
them 1
and 1
had 1
such 1
a 1
strong 1
sure 1
walk 1
that 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
peas 1
either 1
rolled 1
or 1
stirred 1
Then 1
they 1
went 1
away 1
again 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
lion 1
You 1
have 1
lied 1
to 1
me 1
they 1
walk 1
just 1
like 1
men 1
The 1
lion 1
said 1
They 1
have 1
been 1
informed 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
put 1
to 1
the 1
test 1
and 1
have 1
assumed 1
some 1
strength 1
Just 1
let 1
twelve 1
spinning 1
wheels 1
be 1
brought 1
into 1
the 1
ante 1
chamber 1
and 1
they 1
will 1
go 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
be 1
pleased 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
what 1
no 1
man 1
would 1
do 1
The 1
king 1
liked 1
the 1
advice 1
and 1
had 1
the 1
spinning 1
wheels 1
placed 1
in 1
the 1
ante 1
chamber 1
But 1
the 1
servant 1
who 1
was 1
well 1
disposed 1
to 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
went 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
disclosed 1
the 1
project 1
So 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
alone 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
eleven 1
girls 1
Show 1
some 1
constraint 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
look 1
round 1
at 1
the 1
spinning 1
wheels 1
And 1
next 1
morning 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
had 1
his 1
twelve 1
huntsmen 1
summoned 1
they 1
went 1
through 1
the 1
ante 1
chamber 1
and 1
never 1
once 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
spinning 1
wheels 1
Then 1
the 1
king 1
again 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
lion 1
You 1
have 1
deceived 1
me 1
they 1
are 1
men 1
for 1
they 1
have 1
not 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
spinning 1
wheels 1
The 1
lion 1
replied 1
They 1
have 1
restrained 1
themselves 1
The 1
king 1
however 1
would 1
no 1
longer 1
believe 1
the 1
lion 1
The 1
twelve 1
huntsmen 1
always 1
followed 1
the 1
king 1
to 1
the 1
chase 1
and 1
his 1
liking 1
for 1
them 1
continually 1
increased 1
Now 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
pass 1
that 1
once 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
out 1
hunting 1
news 1
came 1
that 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
bride 1
was 1
approaching 1
When 1
the 1
true 1
bride 1
heard 1
that 1
it 1
hurt 1
her 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
her 1
heart 1
was 1
almost 1
broken 1
and 1
she 1
fell 1
fainting 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
The 1
king 1
thought 1
something 1
had 1
happened 1
to 1
his 1
dear 1
huntsman 1
ran 1
up 1
to 1
him 1
wanted 1
to 1
help 1
him 1
and 1
drew 1
his 1
glove 1
off 1
Then 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
ring 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
given 1
to 1
his 1
first 1
bride 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
looked 1
in 1
her 1
face 1
he 1
recognized 1
her 1
Then 1
his 1
heart 1
was 1
so 1
touched 1
that 1
he 1
kissed 1
her 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
opened 1
her 1
eyes 1
he 1
said 1
You 1
are 1
mine 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
yours 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
can 1
alter 1
that 1
He 1
sent 1
a 1
messenger 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
bride 1
and 1
entreated 1
her 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
her 1
own 1
kingdom 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
wife 1
already 1
and 1
someone 1
who 1
had 1
just 1
found 1
an 1
old 1
key 1
did 1
not 1
require 1
a 1
new 1
one 1
Thereupon 1
the 1
wedding 1
was 1
celebrated 1
and 1
the 1
lion 1
was 1
again 1
taken 1
into 1
favour 1
because 1
after 1
all 1
he 1
had 1
told 1
the 1
truth 1
THE 1
KING 1
OF 1
THE 1
GOLDEN 1
MOUNTAIN 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
merchant 1
who 1
had 1
only 1
one 1
child 1
a 1
son 1
that 1
was 1
very 1
young 1
and 1
barely 1
able 1
to 1
run 1
alone 1
He 1
had 1
two 1
richly 1
laden 1
ships 1
then 1
making 1
a 1
voyage 1
upon 1
the 1
seas 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
embarked 1
all 1
his 1
wealth 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
making 1
great 1
gains 1
when 1
the 1
news 1
came 1
that 1
both 1
were 1
lost 1
Thus 1
from 1
being 1
a 1
rich 1
man 1
he 1
became 1
all 1
at 1
once 1
so 1
very 1
poor 1
that 1
nothing 1
was 1
left 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
one 1
small 1
plot 1
of 1
land 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
often 1
went 1
in 1
an 1
evening 1
to 1
take 1
his 1
walk 1
and 1
ease 1
his 1
mind 1
of 1
a 1
little 1
of 1
his 1
trouble 1
One 1
day 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
roaming 1
along 1
in 1
a 1
brown 1
study 1
thinking 1
with 1
no 1
great 1
comfort 1
on 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
and 1
what 1
he 1
now 1
was 1
and 1
was 1
like 1
to 1
be 1
all 1
on 1
a 1
sudden 1
there 1
stood 1
before 1
him 1
a 1
little 1
rough 1
looking 1
black 1
dwarf 1
Prithee 1
friend 1
why 1
so 1
sorrowful 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
the 1
merchant 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
you 1
take 1
so 1
deeply 1
to 1
heart 1
If 1
you 1
would 1
do 1
me 1
any 1
good 1
I 1
would 1
willingly 1
tell 1
you 1
said 1
the 1
merchant 1
Who 1
knows 1
but 1
I 1
may 1
said 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
ails 1
you 1
and 1
perhaps 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
I 1
may 1
be 1
of 1
some 1
use 1
Then 1
the 1
merchant 1
told 1
him 1
how 1
all 1
his 1
wealth 1
was 1
gone 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
and 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
nothing 1
left 1
but 1
that 1
little 1
plot 1
of 1
land 1
Oh 1
trouble 1
not 1
yourself 1
about 1
that 1
said 1
the 1
dwarf 1
only 1
undertake 1
to 1
bring 1
me 1
here 1
twelve 1
years 1
hence 1
whatever 1
meets 1
you 1
first 1
on 1
your 1
going 1
home 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
you 1
please 1
The 1
merchant 1
thought 1
this 1
was 1
no 1
great 1
thing 1
to 1
ask 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
most 1
likely 1
be 1
his 1
dog 1
or 1
his 1
cat 1
or 1
something 1
of 1
that 1
sort 1
but 1
forgot 1
his 1
little 1
boy 1
Heinel 1
so 1
he 1
agreed 1
to 1
the 1
bargain 1
and 1
signed 1
and 1
sealed 1
the 1
bond 1
to 1
do 1
what 1
was 1
asked 1
of 1
him 1
But 1
as 1
he 1
drew 1
near 1
home 1
his 1
little 1
boy 1
was 1
so 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
crept 1
behind 1
him 1
and 1
laid 1
fast 1
hold 1
of 1
his 1
legs 1
and 1
looked 1
up 1
in 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
laughed 1
Then 1
the 1
father 1
started 1
trembling 1
with 1
fear 1
and 1
horror 1
and 1
saw 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
bound 1
himself 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
as 1
no 1
gold 1
was 1
come 1
he 1
made 1
himself 1
easy 1
by 1
thinking 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
joke 1
that 1
the 1
dwarf 1
was 1
playing 1
him 1
and 1
that 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
when 1
the 1
money 1
came 1
he 1
should 1
see 1
the 1
bearer 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
take 1
it 1
in 1
About 1
a 1
month 1
afterwards 1
he 1
went 1
upstairs 1
into 1
a 1
lumber 1
room 1
to 1
look 1
for 1
some 1
old 1
iron 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
sell 1
it 1
and 1
raise 1
a 1
little 1
money 1
and 1
there 1
instead 1
of 1
his 1
iron 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
large 1
pile 1
of 1
gold 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
At 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
this 1
he 1
was 1
overjoyed 1
and 1
forgetting 1
all 1
about 1
his 1
son 1
went 1
into 1
trade 1
again 1
and 1
became 1
a 1
richer 1
merchant 1
than 1
before 1
Meantime 1
little 1
Heinel 1
grew 1
up 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
twelve 1
years 1
drew 1
near 1
the 1
merchant 1
began 1
to 1
call 1
to 1
mind 1
his 1
bond 1
and 1
became 1
very 1
sad 1
and 1
thoughtful 1
so 1
that 1
care 1
and 1
sorrow 1
were 1
written 1
upon 1
his 1
face 1
The 1
boy 1
one 1
day 1
asked 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
matter 1
but 1
his 1
father 1
would 1
not 1
tell 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
at 1
last 1
however 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
without 1
knowing 1
it 1
sold 1
him 1
for 1
gold 1
to 1
a 1
little 1
ugly 1
looking 1
black 1
dwarf 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
twelve 1
years 1
were 1
coming 1
round 1
when 1
he 1
must 1
keep 1
his 1
word 1
Then 1
Heinel 1
said 1
Father 1
give 1
yourself 1
very 1
little 1
trouble 1
about 1
that 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
too 1
much 1
for 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
When 1
the 1
time 1
came 1
the 1
father 1
and 1
son 1
went 1
out 1
together 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
agreed 1
upon 1
and 1
the 1
son 1
drew 1
a 1
circle 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
set 1
himself 1
and 1
his 1
father 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
it 1
The 1
little 1
black 1
dwarf 1
soon 1
came 1
and 1
walked 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
about 1
the 1
circle 1
but 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
any 1
way 1
to 1
get 1
into 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
either 1
could 1
not 1
or 1
dared 1
not 1
jump 1
over 1
it 1
At 1
last 1
the 1
boy 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
Have 1
you 1
anything 1
to 1
say 1
to 1
us 1
my 1
friend 1
or 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
Now 1
Heinel 1
had 1
found 1
a 1
friend 1
in 1
a 1
good 1
fairy 1
that 1
was 1
fond 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
had 1
told 1
him 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
for 1
this 1
fairy 1
knew 1
what 1
good 1
luck 1
was 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
him 1
Have 1
you 1
brought 1
me 1
what 1
you 1
said 1
you 1
would 1
said 1
the 1
dwarf 1
to 1
the 1
merchant 1
The 1
old 1
man 1
held 1
his 1
tongue 1
but 1
Heinel 1
said 1
again 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
here 1
The 1
dwarf 1
said 1
I 1
come 1
to 1
talk 1
with 1
your 1
father 1
not 1
with 1
you 1
You 1
have 1
cheated 1
and 1
taken 1
in 1
my 1
father 1
said 1
the 1
son 1
pray 1
give 1
him 1
up 1
his 1
bond 1
at 1
once 1
Fair 1
and 1
softly 1
said 1
the 1
little 1
old 1
man 1
right 1
is 1
right 1
I 1
have 1
paid 1
my 1
money 1
and 1
your 1
father 1
has 1
had 1
it 1
and 1
spent 1
it 1
so 1
be 1
so 1
good 1
as 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
what 1
I 1
paid 1
it 1
for 1
You 1
must 1
have 1
my 1
consent 1
to 1
that 1
first 1
said 1
Heinel 1
so 1
please 1
to 1
step 1
in 1
here 1
and 1
let 1
us 1
talk 1
it 1
over 1
The 1
old 1
man 1
grinned 1
and 1
showed 1
his 1
teeth 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
very 1
glad 1
to 1
get 1
into 1
the 1
circle 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
Then 1
at 1
last 1
after 1
a 1
long 1
talk 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
terms 1
Heinel 1
agreed 1
that 1
his 1
father 1
must 1
give 1
him 1
up 1
and 1
that 1
so 1
far 1
the 1
dwarf 1
should 1
have 1
his 1
way 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
the 1
fairy 1
had 1
told 1
Heinel 1
what 1
fortune 1
was 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
him 1
if 1
he 1
followed 1
his 1
own 1
course 1
and 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
choose 1
to 1
be 1
given 1
up 1
to 1
his 1
hump 1
backed 1
friend 1
who 1
seemed 1
so 1
anxious 1
for 1
his 1
company 1
So 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
drawn 1
battle 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
it 1
was 1
settled 1
that 1
Heinel 1
should 1
be 1
put 1
into 1
an 1
open 1
boat 1
that 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
sea 1
shore 1
hard 1
by 1
that 1
the 1
father 1
should 1
push 1
him 1
off 1
with 1
his 1
own 1
hand 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
thus 1
be 1
set 1
adrift 1
and 1
left 1
to 1
the 1
bad 1
or 1
good 1
luck 1
of 1
wind 1
and 1
weather 1
Then 1
he 1
took 1
leave 1
of 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
set 1
himself 1
in 1
the 1
boat 1
but 1
before 1
it 1
got 1
far 1
off 1
a 1
wave 1
struck 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
fell 1
with 1
one 1
side 1
low 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
so 1
the 1
merchant 1
thought 1
that 1
poor 1
Heinel 1
was 1
lost 1
and 1
went 1
home 1
very 1
sorrowful 1
while 1
the 1
dwarf 1
went 1
his 1
way 1
thinking 1
that 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
he 1
had 2
his 1
revenge 1
The 1
boat 1
however 1
did 1
not 1
sink 1
for 1
the 1
good 1
fairy 1
took 1
care 1
of 1
her 1
friend 1
and 1
soon 1
raised 1
the 1
boat 1
up 1
again 1
and 1
it 1
went 1
safely 1
on 1
The 1
young 1
man 1
sat 1
safe 1
within 1
till 1
at 1
length 1
it 1
ran 1
ashore 1
upon 1
an 1
unknown 1
land 1
As 1
he 1
jumped 1
upon 1
the 1
shore 1
he 1
saw 1
before 1
him 1
a 1
beautiful 1
castle 1
but 1
empty 1
and 1
dreary 1
within 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
enchanted 1
Here 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
himself 1
must 1
I 1
find 1
the 1
prize 1
the 1
good 1
fairy 1
told 1
me 1
of 1
So 1
he 1
once 1
more 1
searched 1
the 1
whole 1
palace 1
through 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
white 1
snake 1
lying 1
coiled 1
up 1
on 1
a 1
cushion 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
chambers 1
Now 1
the 1
white 1
snake 1
was 1
an 1
enchanted 1
princess 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
Are 1
you 1
at 1
last 1
come 1
to 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
Twelve 1
long 1
years 1
have 1
I 1
waited 1
here 1
for 1
the 1
fairy 1
to 1
bring 1
you 1
hither 1
as 1
she 1
promised 1
for 1
you 1
alone 1
can 1
save 1
me 1
This 1
night 1
twelve 1
men 1
will 1
come 1
their 1
faces 1
will 1
be 1
black 1
and 1
they 1
will 1
be 1
dressed 1
in 1
chain 1
armour 1
They 1
will 1
ask 1
what 1
you 1
do 1
here 1
but 1
give 1
no 1
answer 1
and 1
let 1
them 1
do 1
what 1
they 1
will 1
beat 1
whip 1
pinch 1
prick 1
or 1
torment 1
you 1
bear 1
all 1
only 1
speak 1
not 1
a 1
word 1
and 1
at 1
twelve 1
o 1
clock 1
they 1
must 1
go 1
away 1
The 1
second 1
night 1
twelve 1
others 1
will 1
come 1
and 1
the 1
third 1
night 1
twenty 1
four 1
who 1
will 1
even 1
cut 1
off 1
your 1
head 1
but 1
at 1
the 1
twelfth 1
hour 1
of 1
that 1
night 1
their 1
power 1
is 1
gone 1
and 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
free 1
and 1
will 1
come 1
and 1
bring 1
you 1
the 1
Water 1
of 1
Life 1
and 1
will 1
wash 1
you 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
bring 1
you 1
back 1
to 1
life 1
and 1
health 1
And 1
all 1
came 1
to 1
pass 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
said 1
Heinel 1
bore 1
all 1
and 1
spoke 1
not 1
a 1
word 1
and 1
the 1
third 1
night 1
the 1
princess 1
came 1
and 1
fell 1
on 1
his 1
neck 1
and 1
kissed 1
him 1
Joy 1
and 1
gladness 1
burst 1
forth 1
throughout 1
the 1
castle 1
the 1
wedding 1
was 1
celebrated 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
crowned 1
king 1
of 1
the 1
Golden 1
Mountain 1
They 1
lived 1
together 1
very 1
happily 1
and 1
the 1
queen 1
had 1
a 1
son 1
And 1
thus 1
eight 1
years 1
had 1
passed 1
over 1
their 1
heads 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
thought 1
of 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
long 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
once 1
again 1
But 1
the 1
queen 1
was 1
against 1
his 1
going 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
know 1
well 1
that 1
misfortunes 1
will 1
come 1
upon 1
us 1
if 1
you 1
go 1
However 1
he 1
gave 1
her 1
no 1
rest 1
till 1
she 1
agreed 1
At 1
his 1
going 1
away 1
she 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
wishing 1
ring 1
and 1
said 1
Take 1
this 1
ring 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
on 1
your 1
finger 1
whatever 1
you 1
wish 1
it 1
will 1
bring 1
you 1
only 1
promise 1
never 1
to 1
make 1
use 1
of 1
it 1
to 1
bring 1
me 1
hence 1
to 1
your 1
father 1
s 1
house 1
Then 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
do 1
what 1
she 1
asked 1
and 1
put 1
the 1
ring 1
on 1
his 1
finger 1
and 1
wished 1
himself 1
near 1
the 1
town 1
where 1
his 1
father 1
lived 1
Heinel 1
found 1
himself 1
at 1
the 1
gates 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
but 1
the 1
guards 1
would 1
not 1
let 1
him 1
go 1
in 1
because 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
strangely 1
clad 1
So 1
he 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
a 1
neighbouring 1
hill 1
where 1
a 1
shepherd 1
dwelt 1
and 1
borrowed 1
his 1
old 1
frock 1
and 1
thus 1
passed 1
unknown 1
into 1
the 1
town 1
When 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
s 1
house 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
his 1
son 1
but 1
the 1
merchant 1
would 1
not 1
believe 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
had 2
but 1
one 1
son 1
his 1
poor 1
Heinel 1
who 1
he 1
knew 1
was 1
long 1
since 1
dead 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
only 1
dressed 1
like 1
a 1
poor 1
shepherd 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
even 1
give 1
him 1
anything 1
to 1
eat 1
The 1
king 1
however 1
still 1
vowed 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
his 1
son 1
and 1
said 1
Is 1
there 1
no 1
mark 1
by 1
which 1
you 1
would 1
know 1
me 1
if 1
I 1
am 1
really 1
your 1
son 1
Yes 1
said 1
his 1
mother 1
our 1
Heinel 1
had 1
a 1
mark 1
like 1
a 1
raspberry 1
on 1
his 1
right 1
arm 1
Then 1
he 1
showed 1
them 1
the 1
mark 1
and 1
they 1
knew 1
that 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
said 1
was 1
true 1
He 1
next 1
told 1
them 1
how 1
he 1
was 1
king 1
of 1
the 1
Golden 1
Mountain 1
and 1
was 1
married 1
to 1
a 1
princess 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
son 1
seven 1
years 1
old 1
But 1
the 1
merchant 1
said 1
that 1
can 1
never 1
be 1
true 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
fine 1
king 1
truly 1
who 1
travels 1
about 1
in 1
a 1
shepherd 1
s 1
frock 1
At 1
this 1
the 1
son 1
was 1
vexed 1
and 1
forgetting 1
his 1
word 1
turned 1
his 1
ring 1
and 1
wished 1
for 1
his 1
queen 1
and 1
son 1
In 1
an 1
instant 1
they 1
stood 1
before 1
him 1
but 1
the 1
queen 1
wept 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
had 1
broken 1
his 1
word 1
and 1
bad 1
luck 1
would 1
follow 1
He 1
did 1
all 1
he 1
could 1
to 1
soothe 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
at 1
last 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
appeased 1
but 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
so 1
in 1
truth 1
and 1
was 1
only 1
thinking 1
how 1
she 1
should 1
punish 1
him 1
One 1
day 1
he 1
took 1
her 1
to 1
walk 1
with 1
him 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
showed 1
her 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
the 1
boat 1
was 1
set 1
adrift 1
upon 1
the 1
wide 1
waters 1
Then 1
he 1
sat 1
himself 1
down 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
much 1
tired 1
sit 1
by 1
me 1
I 1
will 1
rest 1
my 1
head 1
in 1
your 1
lap 1
and 1
sleep 1
a 1
while 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
fallen 1
asleep 1
however 1
she 1
drew 1
the 1
ring 1
from 1
his 1
finger 1
and 1
crept 1
softly 1
away 1
and 1
wished 1
herself 1
and 1
her 1
son 1
at 1
home 1
in 1
their 1
kingdom 1
And 1
when 1
he 1
awoke 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
alone 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
ring 1
was 1
gone 1
from 1
his 1
finger 1
I 1
can 1
never 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
house 1
said 1
he 1
they 1
would 1
say 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
sorcerer 1
I 1
will 1
journey 1
forth 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
till 1
I 1
come 1
again 1
to 1
my 1
kingdom 1
So 1
saying 1
he 1
set 1
out 1
and 1
travelled 1
till 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
hill 1
where 1
three 1
giants 1
were 1
sharing 1
their 1
father 1
s 1
goods 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
saw 1
him 1
pass 1
they 1
cried 1
out 1
and 1
said 1
Little 1
men 1
have 1
sharp 1
wits 1
he 1
shall 1
part 1
the 1
goods 1
between 1
us 1
Now 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
sword 1
that 1
cut 1
off 1
an 1
enemy 1
s 1
head 1
whenever 1
the 1
wearer 1
gave 1
the 1
words 1
Heads 1
off 1
a 1
cloak 1
that 1
made 1
the 1
owner 1
invisible 1
or 1
gave 1
him 1
any 1
form 1
he 1
pleased 1
and 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
boots 1
that 1
carried 1
the 1
wearer 1
wherever 1
he 1
wished 1
Heinel 1
said 1
they 1
must 1
first 1
let 1
him 1
try 1
these 1
wonderful 1
things 1
then 1
he 1
might 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
set 1
a 1
value 1
upon 1
them 1
Then 1
they 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
cloak 1
and 1
he 1
wished 1
himself 1
a 1
fly 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
fly 1
The 1
cloak 1
is 1
very 1
well 1
said 1
he 1
now 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
sword 1
No 1
said 1
they 1
not 1
unless 1
you 1
undertake 1
not 1
to 1
say 1
Heads 1
off 1
for 1
if 1
you 1
do 1
we 1
are 1
all 1
dead 1
men 1
So 1
they 1
gave 1
it 1
him 1
charging 1
him 1
to 1
try 1
it 1
on 1
a 1
tree 1
He 1
next 1
asked 1
for 1
the 1
boots 1
also 1
and 1
the 1
moment 1
he 1
had 1
all 1
three 1
in 1
his 1
power 1
he 1
wished 1
himself 1
at 1
the 1
Golden 1
Mountain 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
once 1
So 1
the 1
giants 1
were 1
left 1
behind 1
with 1
no 1
goods 1
to 1
share 1
or 1
quarrel 1
about 1
As 1
Heinel 1
came 1
near 1
his 1
castle 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
merry 1
music 1
and 1
the 1
people 1
around 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
his 1
queen 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
marry 1
another 1
husband 1
Then 1
he 1
threw 1
his 1
cloak 1
around 1
him 1
and 1
passed 1
through 1
the 1
castle 1
hall 1
and 1
placed 1
himself 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
queen 1
where 1
no 1
one 1
saw 1
him 1
But 1
when 1
anything 1
to 1
eat 1
was 1
put 1
upon 1
her 1
plate 1
he 1
took 1
it 1
away 1
and 1
ate 1
it 1
himself 1
and 1
when 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
wine 1
was 1
handed 1
to 1
her 1
he 1
took 1
it 1
and 1
drank 1
it 1
and 1
thus 1
though 1
they 1
kept 1
on 1
giving 1
her 1
meat 1
and 1
drink 1
her 1
plate 1
and 1
cup 1
were 1
always 1
empty 1
Upon 1
this 1
fear 1
and 1
remorse 1
came 1
over 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
went 1
into 1
her 1
chamber 1
alone 1
and 1
sat 1
there 1
weeping 1
and 1
he 1
followed 1
her 1
there 1
Alas 1
said 1
she 1
to 1
herself 1
was 1
I 1
not 1
once 1
set 1
free 1
Why 1
then 1
does 1
this 1
enchantment 1
still 1
seem 1
to 1
bind 1
me 1
False 1
and 1
fickle 1
one 1
said 1
he 1
One 1
indeed 1
came 1
who 1
set 1
thee 1
free 1
and 1
he 1
is 1
now 1
near 1
thee 1
again 1
but 1
how 1
have 1
you 1
used 1
him 1
Ought 1
he 1
to 1
have 1
had 1
such 1
treatment 1
from 1
thee 1
Then 1
he 1
went 1
out 1
and 1
sent 1
away 1
the 1
company 1
and 1
said 1
the 1
wedding 1
was 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
for 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
kingdom 1
But 1
the 1
princes 1
peers 1
and 1
great 1
men 1
mocked 1
at 1
him 1
However 1
he 1
would 1
enter 1
into 1
no 1
parley 1
with 1
them 1
but 1
only 1
asked 1
them 1
if 1
they 1
would 1
go 1
in 1
peace 1
or 1
not 1
Then 1
they 1
turned 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
seize 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
drew 1
his 1
sword 1
Heads 1
Off 1
cried 1
he 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
word 1
the 1
traitors 1
heads 1
fell 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
Heinel 1
was 1
once 1
more 1
king 1
of 1
the 1
Golden 1
Mountain 1
DOCTOR 1
KNOWALL 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
a 1
poor 1
peasant 1
called 1
Crabb 1
who 1
drove 1
with 1
two 1
oxen 1
a 1
load 1
of 1
wood 1
to 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
sold 1
it 1
to 1
a 1
doctor 1
for 1
two 1
talers 1
When 1
the 1
money 1
was 1
being 1
counted 1
out 1
to 1
him 1
it 1
so 1
happened 1
that 1
the 1
doctor 1
was 1
sitting 1
at 1
table 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
peasant 1
saw 1
how 1
well 1
he 1
ate 1
and 1
drank 1
his 1
heart 1
desired 1
what 1
he 1
saw 1
and 1
would 1
willingly 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
doctor 1
too 1
So 1
he 1
remained 1
standing 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
inquired 1
if 1
he 1
too 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
a 1
doctor 1
Oh 1
yes 1
said 1
the 1
doctor 1
that 1
is 1
soon 1
managed 1
What 1
must 1
I 1
do 1
asked 1
the 1
peasant 1
In 1
the 1
first 1
place 1
buy 1
yourself 1
an 1
A 1
B 1
C 1
book 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
which 1
has 1
a 1
cock 1
on 1
the 1
frontispiece 1
in 1
the 1
second 1
turn 1
your 1
cart 1
and 1
your 1
two 1
oxen 1
into 1
money 1
and 1
get 1
yourself 1
some 1
clothes 1
and 1
whatsoever 1
else 1
pertains 1
to 1
medicine 1
thirdly 1
have 1
a 1
sign 1
painted 1
for 1
yourself 1
with 1
the 1
words 1
I 1
am 1
Doctor 1
Knowall 1
and 1
have 1
that 1
nailed 1
up 1
above 1
your 1
house 1
door 1
The 1
peasant 1
did 1
everything 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
told 1
to 1
do 1
When 1
he 1
had 1
doctored 1
people 1
awhile 1
but 1
not 1
long 1
a 1
rich 1
and 1
great 1
lord 1
had 1
some 1
money 1
stolen 1
Then 1
he 1
was 1
told 1
about 1
Doctor 1
Knowall 1
who 1
lived 1
in 1
such 1
and 1
such 1
a 1
village 1
and 1
must 1
know 1
what 1
had 1
become 1
of 1
the 1
money 1
So 1
the 1
lord 1
had 1
the 1
horses 1
harnessed 1
to 1
his 1
carriage 1
drove 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
asked 1
Crabb 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
Doctor 1
Knowall 1
Yes 1
he 1
was 1
he 1
said 1
Then 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
go 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
bring 1
back 1
the 1
stolen 1
money 1
Oh 1
yes 1
but 1
Grete 1
my 1
wife 1
must 1
go 1
too 1
The 1
lord 1
was 1
willing 1
and 1
let 1
both 1
of 1
them 1
have 1
a 1
seat 1
in 1
the 1
carriage 1
and 1
they 1
all 1
drove 1
away 1
together 1
When 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
nobleman 1
s 1
castle 1
the 1
table 1
was 1
spread 1
and 1
Crabb 1
was 1
told 1
to 1
sit 1
down 1
and 1
eat 1
Yes 1
but 1
my 1
wife 1
Grete 1
too 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
he 1
seated 1
himself 1
with 1
her 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
And 1
when 1
the 1
first 1
servant 1
came 1
with 1
a 1
dish 1
of 1
delicate 1
fare 1
the 1
peasant 1
nudged 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
said 1
Grete 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
meaning 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
servant 1
who 1
brought 1
the 1
first 1
dish 1
The 1
servant 1
however 1
thought 1
he 1
intended 1
by 1
that 1
to 1
say 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
thief 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
actually 1
was 1
so 1
he 1
was 1
terrified 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
his 1
comrade 1
outside 1
The 1
doctor 1
knows 1
all 1
we 1
shall 1
fare 1
ill 1
he 1
said 1
I 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
The 1
second 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
in 1
at 1
all 1
but 1
was 1
forced 1
So 1
when 1
he 1
went 1
in 1
with 1
his 1
dish 1
the 1
peasant 1
nudged 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
said 1
Grete 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
second 1
This 1
servant 1
was 1
equally 1
alarmed 1
and 1
he 1
got 1
out 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
The 1
third 1
fared 1
no 1
better 1
for 1
the 1
peasant 1
again 1
said 1
Grete 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
third 1
The 1
fourth 1
had 1
to 1
carry 1
in 1
a 1
dish 1
that 1
was 1
covered 1
and 1
the 1
lord 1
told 1
the 1
doctor 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
show 1
his 1
skill 1
and 1
guess 1
what 1
was 1
beneath 1
the 1
cover 1
Actually 1
there 1
were 1
crabs 1
The 1
doctor 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
dish 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
and 1
cried 1
Ah 1
poor 1
Crabb 1
When 1
the 1
lord 1
heard 1
that 1
he 1
cried 1
There 1
he 1
knows 1
it 1
he 1
must 1
also 1
know 1
who 1
has 1
the 1
money 1
On 1
this 1
the 1
servants 1
looked 1
terribly 1
uneasy 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
sign 1
to 1
the 1
doctor 1
that 1
they 1
wished 1
him 1
to 1
step 1
outside 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
When 1
therefore 1
he 1
went 1
out 1
all 1
four 1
of 1
them 1
confessed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
stolen 1
the 1
money 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
willingly 1
restore 1
it 1
and 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
heavy 1
sum 1
into 1
the 1
bargain 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
denounce 1
them 1
for 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
hanged 1
They 1
led 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
the 1
money 1
was 1
concealed 1
With 1
this 1
the 1
doctor 1
was 1
satisfied 1
and 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
hall 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
said 1
My 1
lord 1
now 1
will 1
I 1
search 1
in 1
my 1
book 1
where 1
the 1
gold 1
is 1
hidden 1
The 1
fifth 1
servant 1
however 1
crept 1
into 1
the 1
stove 1
to 1
hear 1
if 1
the 1
doctor 1
knew 1
still 1
more 1
But 1
the 1
doctor 1
sat 1
still 1
and 1
opened 1
his 1
A 1
B 1
C 1
book 1
turned 1
the 1
pages 1
backwards 1
and 1
forwards 1
and 1
looked 1
for 1
the 1
cock 1
As 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
it 1
immediately 1
he 1
said 1
I 1
know 1
you 1
are 1
there 1
so 1
you 1
had 1
better 1
come 1
out 1
Then 1
the 1
fellow 1
in 1
the 1
stove 1
thought 1
that 1
the 1
doctor 1
meant 1
him 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
terror 1
sprang 1
out 1
crying 1
That 1
man 1
knows 1
everything 1
Then 1
Doctor 1
Knowall 1
showed 1
the 1
lord 1
where 1
the 1
money 1
was 1
but 1
did 1
not 1
say 1
who 1
had 1
stolen 1
it 1
and 1
received 1
from 1
both 1
sides 1
much 1
money 1
in 1
reward 1
and 1
became 1
a 1
renowned 1
man 1
THE 1
SEVEN 1
RAVENS 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
seven 1
sons 1
and 1
last 1
of 1
all 1
one 1
daughter 1
Although 1
the 1
little 1
girl 1
was 1
very 1
pretty 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
weak 1
and 1
small 1
that 1
they 1
thought 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
live 1
but 1
they 1
said 1
she 1
should 1
at 1
once 1
be 1
christened 1
So 1
the 1
father 1
sent 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
sons 1
in 1
haste 1
to 1
the 1
spring 1
to 1
get 1
some 1
water 1
but 1
the 1
other 1
six 1
ran 1
with 1
him 1
Each 1
wanted 1
to 1
be 1
first 1
at 1
drawing 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
so 1
they 1
were 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
hurry 1
that 1
all 1
let 1
their 1
pitchers 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
they 1
stood 1
very 1
foolishly 1
looking 1
at 1
one 1
another 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
for 1
none 1
dared 1
go 1
home 1
In 1
the 1
meantime 1
the 1
father 1
was 1
uneasy 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
tell 1
what 1
made 1
the 1
young 1
men 1
stay 1
so 1
long 1
Surely 1
said 1
he 1
the 1
whole 1
seven 1
must 1
have 1
forgotten 1
themselves 1
over 1
some 1
game 1
of 1
play 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
waited 1
still 1
longer 1
and 1
they 1
yet 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
he 1
flew 1
into 1
a 1
rage 1
and 1
wished 1
them 1
all 1
turned 1
into 1
ravens 1
Scarcely 1
had 1
he 1
spoken 1
these 1
words 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
croaking 1
over 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
looked 1
up 1
and 1
saw 1
seven 1
ravens 1
as 1
black 1
as 1
coal 1
flying 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
Sorry 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
see 1
his 1
wish 1
so 1
fulfilled 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
what 1
was 1
done 1
could 1
be 1
undone 1
and 1
comforted 1
himself 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
for 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
his 1
seven 1
sons 1
with 1
his 1
dear 1
little 1
daughter 1
who 1
soon 1
became 1
stronger 1
and 1
every 1
day 1
more 1
beautiful 1
For 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
ever 1
had 1
any 1
brothers 1
for 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
took 1
care 1
not 1
to 1
speak 1
of 1
them 1
before 1
her 1
but 1
one 1
day 1
by 1
chance 1
she 1
heard 1
the 1
people 1
about 1
her 1
speak 1
of 1
them 1
Yes 1
said 1
they 1
she 1
is 1
beautiful 1
indeed 1
but 1
still 1
tis 1
a 1
pity 1
that 1
her 1
brothers 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
lost 1
for 1
her 1
sake 1
Then 1
she 1
was 1
much 1
grieved 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
and 1
asked 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
any 1
brothers 1
and 1
what 1
had 1
become 1
of 1
them 1
So 1
they 1
dared 1
no 1
longer 1
hide 1
the 1
truth 1
from 1
her 1
but 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
will 1
of 1
Heaven 1
and 1
that 1
her 1
birth 1
was 1
only 1
the 1
innocent 1
cause 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
little 1
girl 1
mourned 1
sadly 1
about 1
it 1
every 1
day 1
and 1
thought 1
herself 1
bound 1
to 1
do 1
all 1
she 1
could 1
to 1
bring 1
her 1
brothers 1
back 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
neither 1
rest 1
nor 1
ease 1
till 1
at 1
length 1
one 1
day 1
she 1
stole 1
away 1
and 1
set 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
wide 1
world 1
to 1
find 1
her 1
brothers 1
wherever 1
they 1
might 1
be 1
and 1
free 1
them 1
whatever 1
it 1
might 1
cost 1
her 1
She 1
took 1
nothing 1
with 1
her 1
but 1
a 1
little 1
ring 1
which 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
had 1
given 1
her 1
a 1
loaf 1
of 1
bread 1
in 1
case 1
she 1
should 1
be 1
hungry 1
a 1
little 1
pitcher 1
of 1
water 1
in 1
case 1
she 1
should 1
be 1
thirsty 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
stool 1
to 1
rest 1
upon 1
when 1
she 1
should 1
be 1
weary 1
Thus 1
she 1
went 1
on 1
and 1
on 1
and 1
journeyed 1
till 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
world 1
s 1
end 1
then 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
sun 1
but 1
the 1
sun 1
looked 1
much 1
too 1
hot 1
and 1
fiery 1
so 1
she 1
ran 1
away 1
quickly 1
to 1
the 1
moon 1
but 1
the 1
moon 1
was 1
cold 1
and 1
chilly 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
smell 1
flesh 1
and 1
blood 1
this 1
way 1
so 1
she 1
took 1
herself 1
away 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
and 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
stars 1
and 1
the 1
stars 1
were 1
friendly 1
and 1
kind 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
each 1
star 1
sat 1
upon 1
his 1
own 1
little 1
stool 1
but 1
the 1
morning 1
star 1
rose 1
up 1
and 1
gave 1
her 1
a 1
little 1
piece 1
of 1
wood 1
and 1
said 1
If 1
you 1
have 1
not 1
this 1
little 1
piece 1
of 1
wood 1
you 1
cannot 1
unlock 1
the 1
castle 1
that 1
stands 1
on 1
the 1
glass 1
mountain 1
and 1
there 1
your 1
brothers 1
live 1
The 1
little 1
girl 1
took 1
the 1
piece 1
of 1
wood 1
rolled 1
it 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
cloth 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
again 1
until 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
glass 1
mountain 1
and 1
found 1
the 1
door 1
shut 1
Then 1
she 1
felt 1
for 1
the 1
little 1
piece 1
of 1
wood 1
but 1
when 1
she 1
unwrapped 1
the 1
cloth 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
there 1
and 1
she 1
saw 1
she 1
had 1
lost 1
the 1
gift 1
of 1
the 1
good 1
stars 1
What 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
She 1
wanted 1
to 1
save 1
her 1
brothers 1
and 1
had 1
no 1
key 1
of 1
the 1
castle 1
of 1
the 1
glass 1
mountain 1
so 1
this 1
faithful 1
little 1
sister 1
took 1
a 1
knife 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
pocket 1
and 1
cut 1
off 1
her 1
little 1
finger 1
that 1
was 1
just 1
the 1
size 1
of 1
the 1
piece 1
of 1
wood 1
she 1
had 1
lost 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
opened 1
it 1
As 1
she 1
went 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
dwarf 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
What 1
are 1
you 1
seeking 1
for 1
I 1
seek 1
for 1
my 1
brothers 1
the 1
seven 1
ravens 1
answered 1
she 1
Then 1
the 1
dwarf 1
said 1
My 1
masters 1
are 1
not 1
at 1
home 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
wait 1
till 1
they 1
come 1
pray 1
step 1
in 1
Now 1
the 1
little 1
dwarf 1
was 1
getting 1
their 1
dinner 1
ready 1
and 1
he 1
brought 1
their 1
food 1
upon 1
seven 1
little 1
plates 1
and 1
their 1
drink 1
in 1
seven 1
little 1
glasses 1
and 1
set 1
them 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
each 1
little 1
plate 1
their 1
sister 1
ate 1
a 1
small 1
piece 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
each 1
little 1
glass 1
she 1
drank 1
a 1
small 1
drop 1
but 1
she 1
let 1
the 1
ring 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
brought 1
with 1
her 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
last 1
glass 1
On 1
a 1
sudden 1
she 1
heard 1
a 1
fluttering 1
and 1
croaking 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
the 1
dwarf 1
said 1
Here 1
come 1
my 1
masters 1
When 1
they 1
came 1
in 1
they 1
wanted 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
drink 1
and 1
looked 1
for 1
their 1
little 1
plates 1
and 1
glasses 1
Then 1
said 1
one 1
after 1
the 1
other 1
Who 1
has 1
eaten 1
from 1
my 1
little 1
plate 1
And 1
who 1
has 1
been 1
drinking 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
little 1
glass 1
Caw 2
well 1
I 1
ween 1
Mortal 1
lips 1
have 1
this 1
way 1
been 1
When 1
the 1
seventh 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
his 1
glass 1
and 1
found 1
there 1
the 1
ring 1
he 1
looked 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
father 1
s 1
and 1
mother 1
s 1
and 1
said 1
O 1
that 1
our 1
little 1
sister 1
would 1
but 1
come 1
then 1
we 1
should 1
be 1
free 1
When 1
the 1
little 1
girl 1
heard 1
this 1
for 1
she 1
stood 1
behind 1
the 1
door 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
listened 1
she 1
ran 1
forward 1
and 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
all 1
the 1
ravens 1
took 1
their 1
right 1
form 1
again 1
and 1
all 1
hugged 1
and 1
kissed 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
went 1
merrily 1
home 1
THE 1

FIRST 1
STORY 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
an 1
old 1
fox 1
with 1
nine 1
tails 1
who 1
believed 1
that 1
his 1
wife 1
was 1
not 1
faithful 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
wished 1
to 1
put 1
her 1
to 1

test 1
He 1
stretched 1
himself 1
out 1
under 1
the 1
bench 1
did 1
not 1
move 1
a 1
limb 1
and 1
behaved 1

her 1

She 1
went 1
and 1
opened 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
young 1
fox 1
who 1
said 1
What 1

about 1
Miss 1
Cat 1
Do 1

Weeping 1
her 1

Because 1

After 1
this 1
still 1
more 1

just 1
as 1

and 1
the 1

asked 1
Has 1
the 1
gentleman 1
red 1
stockings 1
on 1
and 1
has 1
he 1
a 1
pointed 1
mouth 1
No 1
answered 1
the 1
cat 1
Then 1
he 1
won 1
t 1
do 1
for 1
me 1
When 1
the 1
wolf 1
was 1
gone 1
came 1
a 1
dog 1
a 1
stag 1
a 1
hare 1
a 1
bear 1
a 1
lion 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
beasts 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
one 1
after 1
the 1
other 1
But 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
good 1
qualities 1
which 1
old 1
Mr 1
Fox 1
had 1
possessed 1
was 1
always 1
lacking 1
and 1
the 1
cat 1
had 1
continually 1
to 1
send 1
the 1
suitors 1
away 1
At 1
length 1
came 1
a 1
young 1
fox 1
Then 1
Mrs 1
Fox 1
said 1
Has 1
the 1
gentleman 1
red 1
stockings 1
on 1
and 1
has 1
a 1
little 1
pointed 1
mouth 1
Yes 1
said 1
the 1
cat 1
he 1
has 1
Then 1
let 1
him 1
come 1
upstairs 1
said 1
Mrs 1
Fox 1
and 1
ordered 1
the 1
servant 1
to 1
prepare 1
the 1
wedding 1
feast 1
Sweep 1
me 1
the 1
room 1
as 1
clean 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
Up 1
with 1
the 1
window 1
fling 1
out 1
my 1
old 1
man 1
For 1
many 1
a 1
fine 1
fat 1
mouse 1
he 1
brought 1
Yet 1
of 1
his 1
wife 1
he 1
never 1
thought 1
But 1
ate 1
up 1
every 1
one 1
he 1
caught 1
Then 1
the 1
wedding 1
was 1
solemnized 1
with 1
young 1
Mr 1
Fox 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
much 1
rejoicing 1
and 1
dancing 1
and 1
if 1
they 1
have 1
not 1
left 1
off 1
they 1
are 1
dancing 1
still 1
THE 1
SALAD 1
As 1
a 1
merry 1
young 1
huntsman 1
was 1
once 1
going 1
briskly 1
along 1
through 1
a 1
wood 1
there 1
came 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
old 1
woman 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
Good 1
day 1
good 1
day 1
you 1
seem 1
merry 1
enough 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
hungry 1
and 1
thirsty 1
do 1
pray 1
give 1
me 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
The 1
huntsman 1
took 1
pity 1
on 1
her 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
gave 1
her 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
Then 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
his 1
way 1
but 1
she 1
took 1
hold 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
Listen 1
my 1
friend 1
to 1
what 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
I 1
will 1
reward 1
you 1
for 1
your 1
kindness 1
go 1
your 1
way 1
and 1
after 1
a 1
little 1
time 1
you 1
will 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
tree 1
where 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
nine 1
birds 1
sitting 1
on 1
a 1
cloak 1
Shoot 1
into 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
one 1
will 1
fall 1
down 1
dead 1
the 1
cloak 1
will 1
fall 1
too 1
take 1
it 2
is 1
a 1
wishing 1
cloak 1
and 1
when 1
you 1
wear 1
it 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
yourself 1
at 1
any 1
place 1
where 1
you 1
may 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
Cut 1
open 1
the 1
dead 1
bird 1
take 1
out 1
its 1
heart 1
and 1
keep 1
it 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
gold 1
under 1
your 1
pillow 1
every 1
morning 1
when 1
you 1
rise 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
bird 1
s 1
heart 1
that 1
will 1
bring 1
you 1
this 1
good 1
luck 1
The 1
huntsman 1
thanked 1
her 1
and 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
If 1
all 1
this 1
does 1
happen 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
fine 1
thing 1
for 1
me 1
When 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
a 1
hundred 1
steps 1
or 1
so 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
screaming 1
and 1
chirping 1
in 1
the 1
branches 1
over 1
him 1
and 1
looked 1
up 1
and 1
saw 1
a 1
flock 1
of 1
birds 1
pulling 1
a 1
cloak 1
with 1
their 1
bills 1
and 1
feet 1
screaming 1
fighting 1
and 1
tugging 1
at 1
each 1
other 1
as 1
if 1
each 1
wished 1
to 1
have 1
it 1
himself 1
Well 1
said 1
the 1
huntsman 1
this 1
is 1
wonderful 1
this 1
happens 1
just 1
as 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
said 1
then 1
he 1
shot 1
into 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
them 1
so 1
that 1
their 1
feathers 1
flew 1
all 1
about 1
Off 1
went 1
the 1
flock 1
chattering 1
away 1
but 1
one 1
fell 1
down 1
dead 1
and 1
the 1
cloak 1
with 1
it 1
Then 1
the 1
huntsman 1
did 1
as 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
told 1
him 1
cut 1
open 1
the 1
bird 1
took 1
out 1
the 1
heart 1
and 1
carried 1
the 1
cloak 1
home 1
with 1
him 1
The 1
next 1
morning 1
when 1
he 1
awoke 1
he 1
lifted 1
up 1
his 1
pillow 1
and 1
there 1
lay 1
the 1
piece 1
of 1
gold 1
glittering 1
underneath 1
the 1
same 1
happened 1
next 1
day 1
and 1
indeed 1
every 1
day 1
when 1
he 1
arose 1
He 1
heaped 1
up 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
Of 1
what 1
use 1
is 1
this 1
gold 1
to 1
me 1
whilst 1
I 1
am 1
at 1
home 1
I 1
will 1
go 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
look 1
about 1
me 1
Then 1
he 1
took 1
leave 1
of 1
his 1
friends 1
and 1
hung 1
his 1
bag 1
and 1
bow 1
about 1
his 1
neck 1
and 1
went 1
his 1
way 1
It 1
so 1
happened 1
that 1
his 1
road 1
one 1
day 1
led 1
through 1
a 1
thick 1
wood 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
large 1
castle 1
in 1
a 1
green 1
meadow 1
and 1
at 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
windows 1
stood 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
beautiful 1
young 1
lady 1
by 1
her 1
side 1
looking 1
about 1
them 1
Now 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
was 1
a 1
witch 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
young 1
man 1
coming 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
who 1
carries 1
a 1
wonderful 1
prize 1
we 1
must 1
get 1
it 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
my 1
dear 1
child 1
for 1
it 1
is 1
more 1
fit 1
for 1
us 1
than 1
for 1
him 1
He 1
has 1
a 1
bird 1
s 1
heart 1
that 1
brings 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
gold 1
under 1
his 1
pillow 1
every 1
morning 1
Meantime 1
the 1
huntsman 1
came 1
nearer 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
lady 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
travelling 1
so 1
long 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
this 1
castle 1
and 1
rest 1
myself 1
for 1
I 1
have 1
money 1
enough 1
to 1
pay 1
for 1
anything 1
I 1
want 1
but 1
the 1
real 1
reason 1
was 1
that 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
see 1
more 1
of 1
the 1
beautiful 1
lady 1
Then 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
was 1
welcomed 1
kindly 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
much 1
in 1
love 1
that 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
nothing 1
else 1
but 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
lady 1
s 1
eyes 1
and 1
doing 1
everything 1
that 1
she 1
wished 1
Then 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
said 1
Now 1
is 1
the 1
time 1
for 1
getting 1
the 1
bird 1
s 1
heart 1
So 1
the 1
lady 1
stole 1
it 1
away 1
and 1
he 1
never 1
found 1
any 1
more 1
gold 1
under 1
his 1
pillow 1
for 1
it 1
lay 1
now 1
under 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
s 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
took 1
it 1
away 1
every 1
morning 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
much 1
in 1
love 1
that 1
he 1
never 1
missed 1
his 1
prize 1
Well 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
witch 1
we 1
have 1
got 1
the 1
bird 1
s 1
heart 1
but 1
not 1
the 1
wishing 1
cloak 1
yet 1
and 1
that 1
we 1
must 1
also 1
get 1
Let 1
us 1
leave 1
him 1
that 1
said 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
he 1
has 1
already 1
lost 1
his 1
wealth 1
Then 1
the 1
witch 1
was 1
very 1
angry 1
and 1
said 1
Such 1
a 1
cloak 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
rare 1
and 1
wonderful 1
thing 1
and 1
I 1
must 1
and 1
will 1
have 1
it 1
So 1
she 1
did 1
as 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
told 1
her 1
and 1
set 1
herself 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
looked 1
about 1
the 1
country 1
and 1
seemed 1
very 1
sorrowful 1
then 1
the 1
huntsman 1
said 1
What 1
makes 1
you 1
so 1
sad 1
Alas 1
dear 1
sir 1
said 1
she 1
yonder 1
lies 1
the 1
granite 1
rock 1
where 1
all 1
the 1
costly 1
diamonds 1
grow 1
and 1
I 1
want 1
so 1
much 1
to 1
go 1
there 1
that 1
whenever 1
I 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
I 1
cannot 1
help 1
being 1
sorrowful 1
for 1
who 1
can 1
reach 1
it 1
only 1
the 1
birds 1
and 1
the 1
flies 1
man 1
cannot 1
If 1
that 1
s 1
all 1
your 1
grief 1
said 1
the 1
huntsman 1
I 1
ll 1
take 1
you 1
there 1
with 1
all 1
my 1
heart 1
so 1
he 1
drew 1
her 1
under 1
his 1
cloak 1
and 1
the 1
moment 1
he 1
wished 1
to 1
be 1
on 1
the 1
granite 1
mountain 1
they 1
were 1
both 1
there 1
The 1
diamonds 1
glittered 1
so 1
on 1
all 1
sides 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
delighted 1
with 1
the 1
sight 1
and 1
picked 1
up 1
the 1
finest 1
But 1
the 1
old 1
witch 1
made 1
a 1
deep 1
sleep 1
come 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
Let 1
us 1
sit 1
down 1
and 1
rest 1
ourselves 1
a 1
little 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
tired 1
that 1
I 1
cannot 1
stand 1
any 1
longer 1
So 1
they 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
he 1
laid 1
his 1
head 1
in 1
her 1
lap 1
and 1
fell 1
asleep 1
and 1
whilst 1
he 1
was 1
sleeping 1
on 1
she 1
took 1
the 1
cloak 1
from 1
his 1
shoulders 1
hung 1
it 1
on 1
her 1
own 1
picked 1
up 1
the 1
diamonds 1
and 1
wished 1
herself 1
home 1
again 1
When 1
he 1
awoke 1
and 1
found 1
that 1
his 1
lady 1
had 1
tricked 1
him 1
and 1
left 1
him 1
alone 1
on 1
the 1
wild 1
rock 1
he 1
said 1
Alas 1
what 1
roguery 1
there 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
sat 1
in 1
great 1
grief 1
and 1
fear 1
not 1
knowing 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
Now 1
this 1
rock 1
belonged 1
to 1
fierce 1
giants 1
who 1
lived 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
saw 1
three 1
of 1
them 1
striding 1
about 1
he 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
I 1
can 1
only 1
save 1
myself 1
by 1
feigning 1
to 1
be 1
asleep 1
so 1
he 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
in 1
a 1
sound 1
sleep 1
When 1
the 1
giants 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
first 1
pushed 1
him 1
with 1
his 1
foot 1
and 1
said 1
What 1
worm 1
is 1
this 1
that 1
lies 1
here 1
curled 1
up 1
Tread 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
kill 1
him 1
said 1
the 1
second 1
It 1
s 1
not 1
worth 1
the 1
trouble 1
said 1
the 1
third 1
let 1
him 1
live 1
he 1
ll 1
go 1
climbing 1
higher 1
up 1
the 1
mountain 1
and 1
some 1
cloud 1
will 1
come 1
rolling 1
and 1
carry 1
him 1
away 1
And 1
they 1
passed 1
on 1
But 1
the 1
huntsman 1
had 1
heard 1
all 1
they 1
said 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
gone 1
he 1
climbed 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
mountain 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
sat 1
there 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
a 1
cloud 1
came 1
rolling 1
around 1
him 1
and 1
caught 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
whirlwind 1
and 1
bore 1
him 1
along 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
till 1
it 1
settled 1
in 1
a 1
garden 1
and 1
he 1
fell 1
quite 1
gently 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
amongst 1
the 1
greens 1
and 1
cabbages 1
Then 1
he 1
looked 1
around 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
had 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
if 1
not 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
worse 1
off 1
than 1
before 1
for 1
here 1
I 1
see 1
neither 1
apples 1
nor 1
pears 1
nor 1
any 1
kind 1
of 1
fruits 1
nothing 1
but 1
vegetables 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
I 1
can 1
eat 1
salad 1
it 1
will 1
refresh 1
and 1
strengthen 1
me 1
So 1
he 1
picked 1
out 1
a 1
fine 1
head 1
and 1
ate 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
scarcely 1
had 1
he 1
swallowed 1
two 1
bites 1
when 1
he 1
felt 1
himself 1
quite 1
changed 1
and 1
saw 1
with 1
horror 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
turned 1
into 1
an 1
ass 1
However 1
he 1
still 1
felt 1
very 1
hungry 1
and 1
the 1
salad 1
tasted 1
very 1
nice 1
so 1
he 1
ate 1
on 1
till 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
another 1
kind 1
of 1
salad 1
and 1
scarcely 1
had 1
he 1
tasted 1
it 1
when 1
he 1
felt 1
another 1
change 1
come 1
over 1
him 1
and 1
soon 1
saw 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
lucky 1
enough 1
to 1
have 1
found 1
his 1
old 1
shape 1
again 1
Then 1
he 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
and 1
slept 1
off 1
a 1
little 1
of 1
his 1
weariness 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
awoke 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
he 1
broke 1
off 1
a 1
head 1
both 1
of 1
the 1
good 1
and 1
the 1
bad 1
salad 1
and 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
This 1
will 1
help 1
me 1
to 1
my 1
fortune 1
again 1
and 1
enable 1
me 1
to 1
pay 1
off 1
some 1
folks 1
for 1
their 1
treachery 1
So 1
he 1
went 1
away 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
find 1
the 1
castle 1
of 1
his 1
friends 1
and 1
after 1
wandering 1
about 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
he 1
luckily 1
found 1
it 1
Then 1
he 1
stained 1
his 1
face 1
all 1
over 1
brown 1
so 1
that 1
even 1
his 1
mother 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
known 1
him 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
castle 1
and 1
asked 1
for 1
a 1
lodging 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
tired 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
I 1
can 1
go 1
no 1
farther 1
Countryman 1
said 1
the 1
witch 1
who 1
are 1
you 1
and 1
what 1
is 1
your 1
business 1
I 1
am 1
said 1
he 1
a 1
messenger 1
sent 1
by 1
the 1
king 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
finest 1
salad 1
that 1
grows 1
under 1
the 1
sun 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
lucky 1
enough 1
to 1
find 1
it 1
and 1
have 1
brought 1
it 1
with 1
me 1
but 1
the 1
heat 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
scorches 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
begins 1
to 1
wither 1
and 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
that 1
I 1
can 1
carry 1
it 1
farther 1
When 1
the 1
witch 1
and 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
heard 1
of 1
his 1
beautiful 1
salad 1
they 1
longed 1
to 1
taste 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
Dear 1
countryman 1
let 1
us 1
just 1
taste 1
it 1
To 1
be 1
sure 1
answered 1
he 1
I 1
have 1
two 1
heads 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
one 1
so 1
he 1
opened 1
his 1
bag 1
and 1
gave 1
them 1
the 1
bad 1
Then 1
the 1
witch 1
herself 1
took 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
to 1
be 1
dressed 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
ready 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
wait 1
till 1
it 1
was 1
carried 1
up 1
but 1
took 1
a 1
few 1
leaves 1
immediately 1
and 1
put 1
them 1
in 1
her 1
mouth 1
and 1
scarcely 1
were 1
they 1
swallowed 1
when 1
she 1
lost 1
her 1
own 1
form 1
and 1
ran 1
braying 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
court 1
in 1
the 1
form 1
of 1
an 1
ass 1
Now 1
the 1
servant 1
maid 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
seeing 1
the 1
salad 1
ready 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
carry 1
it 1
up 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
she 1
too 1
felt 1
a 1
wish 1
to 1
taste 1
it 1
as 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
had 1
done 1
and 1
ate 1
some 1
leaves 1
so 1
she 1
also 1
was 1
turned 1
into 1
an 1
ass 1
and 1
ran 1
after 1
the 1
other 1
letting 1
the 1
dish 1
with 1
the 1
salad 1
fall 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
The 1
messenger 1
sat 1
all 1
this 1
time 1
with 1
the 1
beautiful 1
young 1
lady 1
and 1
as 1
nobody 1
came 1
with 1
the 1
salad 1
and 1
she 1
longed 1
to 1
taste 1
it 1
she 1
said 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
where 1
the 1
salad 1
can 1
be 1
Then 1
he 1
thought 1
something 1
must 1
have 1
happened 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
will 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
see 1
And 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
he 1
saw 1
two 1
asses 1
in 1
the 1
court 1
running 1
about 1
and 1
the 1
salad 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
All 1
right 1
said 1
he 1
those 1
two 1
have 1
had 1
their 1
share 1
Then 1
he 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
leaves 1
laid 1
them 1
on 1
the 1
dish 1
and 1
brought 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
saying 1
I 1
bring 1
you 1
the 1
dish 1
myself 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
not 1
wait 1
any 1
longer 1
So 1
she 1
ate 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
like 1
the 1
others 1
ran 1
off 1
into 1
the 1
court 1
braying 1
away 1
Then 1
the 1
huntsman 1
washed 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
court 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
know 1
him 1
Now 1
you 1
shall 1
be 1
paid 1
for 1
your 1
roguery 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
tied 1
them 1
all 1
three 1
to 1
a 1
rope 1
and 1
took 1
them 1
along 1
with 1
him 1
till 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
mill 1
and 1
knocked 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
What 1
s 1
the 1
matter 1
said 1
the 1
miller 1
I 1
have 1
three 1
tiresome 1
beasts 1
here 1
said 1
the 1
other 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
take 1
them 1
give 1
them 1
food 1
and 1
room 1
and 1
treat 1
them 1
as 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
I 1
will 1
pay 1
you 1
whatever 1
you 1
ask 1
With 1
all 1
my 1
heart 1
said 1
the 1
miller 1
but 1
how 1
shall 1
I 1
treat 1
them 1
Then 1
the 1
huntsman 1
said 1
Give 1
the 1
old 1
one 1
stripes 1
three 1
times 1
a 1
day 1
and 1
hay 1
once 1
give 1
the 1
next 1
who 1
was 1
the 1
servant 1
maid 1
stripes 1
once 1
a 1
day 1
and 1
hay 1
three 1
times 1
and 1
give 1
the 1
youngest 1
who 1
was 1
the 1
beautiful 1
lady 1
hay 1
three 1
times 1
a 1
day 1
and 1
no 1
stripes 1
for 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
it 1
in 1
his 1
heart 1
to 1
have 1
her 1
beaten 1
After 1
this 1
he 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
castle 1
where 1
he 1
found 1
everything 1
he 1
wanted 1
Some 1
days 1
after 1
the 1
miller 1
came 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
old 1
ass 1
was 1
dead 1
The 1
other 1
two 1
said 1
he 1
are 1
alive 1
and 1
eat 1
but 1
are 1
so 1
sorrowful 1
that 1
they 1
cannot 1
last 1
long 1
Then 1
the 1
huntsman 1
pitied 1
them 1
and 1
told 1
the 1
miller 1
to 1
drive 1
them 1
back 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
he 1
gave 1
them 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
good 1
salad 1
to 1
eat 1
And 1
the 1
beautiful 1
young 1
lady 1
fell 1
upon 1
her 1
knees 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
O 1
dearest 1
huntsman 1
forgive 1
me 1
all 1
the 1
ill 1
I 1
have 1
done 1
you 1
my 1
mother 1
forced 1
me 1
to 1
it 2
was 1
against 1
my 1
will 1
for 1
I 1
always 1
loved 1
you 1
very 1
much 1
Your 1
wishing 1
cloak 1
hangs 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
closet 1
and 1
as 1
for 1
the 1
bird 1
s 1
heart 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
it 1
you 1
too 1
But 1
he 1
said 1
Keep 1
it 2
will 1
be 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
for 1
I 1
mean 1
to 1
make 1
you 1
my 1
wife 1
So 1
they 1
were 1
married 1
and 1
lived 1
together 1
very 1
happily 1
till 1
they 1
died 1
THE 1
STORY 1
OF 1
THE 1
YOUTH 1
WHO 1
WENT 1
FORTH 1
TO 1
LEARN 1
WHAT 1
FEAR 1
WAS 1
A 1
certain 1
father 1
had 1
two 1
sons 1
the 1
elder 1
of 1
who 1
was 1
smart 1
and 1
sensible 1
and 1
could 1
do 1
everything 1
but 1
the 1
younger 1
was 1
stupid 1
and 1
could 1
neither 1
learn 1
nor 1
understand 1
anything 1
and 1
when 1
people 1
saw 1
him 1
they 1
said 1
There 1
s 1
a 1
fellow 1
who 1
will 1
give 1
his 1
father 1
some 1
trouble 1
When 1
anything 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
it 1
was 1
always 1
the 1
elder 1
who 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
but 1
if 1
his 1
father 1
bade 1
him 1
fetch 1
anything 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
late 1
or 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
time 1
and 1
the 1
way 1
led 1
through 1
the 1
churchyard 1
or 1
any 1
other 1
dismal 1
place 1
he 1
answered 1
Oh 1
no 1
father 1
I 1
ll 1
not 1
go 1
there 1
it 1
makes 1
me 1
shudder 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
afraid 1
Or 1
when 1
stories 1
were 1
told 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
at 1
night 1
which 1
made 1
the 1
flesh 1
creep 1
the 1
listeners 1
sometimes 1
said 1
Oh 1
it 1
makes 1
us 1
shudder 1
The 1
younger 1
sat 1
in 1
a 1
corner 1
and 1
listened 1
with 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
imagine 1
what 1
they 1
could 1
mean 1
They 1
are 1
always 1
saying 1
It 1
makes 1
me 1
shudder 1
it 1
makes 1
me 1
shudder 1
It 1
does 1
not 1
make 1
me 1
shudder 1
thought 1
he 1
That 1
too 1
must 1
be 1
an 1
art 1
of 1
which 1
I 1
understand 1
nothing 1
Now 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
pass 1
that 1
his 1
father 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
one 1
day 1
Hearken 1
to 1
me 1
you 1
fellow 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
there 1
you 1
are 1
growing 1
tall 1
and 1
strong 1
and 1
you 1
too 1
must 1
learn 1
something 1
by 1
which 1
you 1
can 1
earn 1
your 1
bread 1
Look 1
how 1
your 1
brother 1
works 1
but 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
even 1
earn 1
your 1
salt 1
Well 1
father 1
he 1
replied 1
I 1
am 1
quite 1
willing 1
to 1
learn 1
something 1
indeed 1
if 1
it 1
could 1
but 1
be 1
managed 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
learn 1
how 1
to 1
shudder 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
understand 1
that 1
at 1
all 1
yet 1
The 1
elder 1
brother 1
smiled 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
that 1
and 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
Goodness 1
what 1
a 1
blockhead 1
that 1
brother 1
of 1
mine 1
is 1
He 1
will 1
never 1
be 1
good 1
for 1
anything 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
he 1
lives 1
He 1
who 1
wants 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
sickle 1
must 1
bend 1
himself 1
betimes 1
The 1
father 1
sighed 1
and 1
answered 1
him 1
You 1
shall 1
soon 1
learn 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
shudder 1
but 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
earn 1
your 1
bread 1
by 1
that 1
Soon 1
after 1
this 1
the 1
sexton 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
on 1
a 1
visit 1
and 1
the 1
father 1
bewailed 1
his 1
trouble 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
how 1
his 1
younger 1
son 1
was 1
so 1
backward 1
in 1
every 1
respect 1
that 1
he 1
knew 1
nothing 1
and 1
learnt 1
nothing 1
Just 1
think 1
said 1
he 1
when 1
I 1
asked 1
him 1
how 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
earn 1
his 1
bread 1
he 1
actually 1
wanted 1
to 1
learn 1
to 1
shudder 1
If 1
that 1
be 1
all 1
replied 1
the 1
sexton 1
he 1
can 1
learn 1
that 1
with 1
me 1
Send 1
him 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
soon 1
polish 1
him 1
The 1
father 1
was 1
glad 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
for 1
he 1
thought 1
It 1
will 1
train 1
the 1
boy 1
a 1
little 1
The 1
sexton 1
therefore 1
took 1
him 1
into 1
his 1
house 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
ring 1
the 1
church 1
bell 1
After 1
a 1
day 1
or 1
two 1
the 1
sexton 1
awoke 1
him 1
at 1
midnight 1
and 1
bade 1
him 1
arise 1
and 1
go 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
church 1
tower 1
and 1
ring 1
the 1
bell 1
You 1
shall 1
soon 1
learn 1
what 1
shuddering 1
is 1
thought 1
he 1
and 1
secretly 1
went 1
there 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
boy 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
tower 1
and 1
turned 1
round 1
and 1
was 1
just 1
going 1
to 1
take 1
hold 1
of 1
the 1
bell 1
rope 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
white 1
figure 1
standing 1
on 1
the 1
stairs 1
opposite 1
the 1
sounding 1
hole 1
Who 1
is 1
there 1
cried 1
he 1
but 1
the 1
figure 1
made 1
no 1
reply 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
move 1
or 1
stir 1
Give 1
an 1
answer 1
cried 1
the 1
boy 1
or 1
take 1
yourself 1
off 1
you 1
have 1
no 1
business 1
here 1
at 1
night 1
The 1
sexton 1
however 1
remained 1
standing 1
motionless 1
that 1
the 1
boy 1
might 1
think 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
ghost 1
The 1
boy 1
cried 1
a 1
second 1
time 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
here 1
speak 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
an 1
honest 1
fellow 1
or 1
I 1
will 1
throw 1
you 1
down 1
the 1
steps 1
The 1
sexton 1
thought 1
He 1
can 1
t 1
mean 1
to 1
be 1
as 1
bad 1
as 1
his 1
words 1
uttered 1
no 1
sound 1
and 1
stood 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
made 1
of 1
stone 1
Then 1
the 1
boy 1
called 1
to 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
third 1
time 1
and 1
as 1
that 1
was 1
also 1
to 1
no 1
purpose 1
he 1
ran 1
against 1
him 1
and 1
pushed 1
the 1
ghost 1
down 1
the 1
stairs 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
fell 1
down 1
the 1
ten 1
steps 1
and 1
remained 1
lying 1
there 1
in 1
a 1
corner 1
Thereupon 1
he 1
rang 1
the 1
bell 1
went 1
home 1
and 1
without 1
saying 1
a 1
word 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
and 1
fell 1
asleep 1
The 1
sexton 1
s 1
wife 1
waited 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
for 1
her 1
husband 1
but 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
back 1
At 1
length 1
she 1
became 1
uneasy 1
and 1
wakened 1
the 1
boy 1
and 1
asked 1
Do 1
you 1
know 1
where 1
my 1
husband 1
is 1
He 1
climbed 1
up 1
the 1
tower 1
before 1
you 1
did 1
No 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
replied 1
the 1
boy 1
but 1
someone 1
was 1
standing 1
by 1
the 1
sounding 1
hole 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
steps 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
would 1
neither 1
gave 1
an 1
answer 1
nor 1
go 1
away 1
I 1
took 1
him 1
for 1
a 1
scoundrel 1
and 1
threw 1
him 1
downstairs 1
Just 1
go 1
there 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
sorry 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
The 1
woman 1
ran 1
away 1
and 1
found 1
her 1
husband 1
who 1
was 1
lying 1
moaning 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
and 1
had 1
broken 1
his 1
leg 1
She 1
carried 1
him 1
down 1
and 1
then 1
with 1
loud 1
screams 1
she 1
hastened 1
to 1
the 1
boy 1
s 1
father 1
Your 1
boy 1
cried 1
she 1
has 1
been 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
a 1
great 1
misfortune 1
He 1
has 1
thrown 1
my 1
husband 1
down 1
the 1
steps 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
broke 1
his 1
leg 1
Take 1
the 1
good 1
for 1
nothing 1
fellow 1
out 1
of 1
our 1
house 1
The 1
father 1
was 1
terrified 1
and 1
ran 1
thither 1
and 1
scolded 1
the 1
boy 1
What 1
wicked 1
tricks 1
are 1
these 1
said 1
he 1
The 1
devil 1
must 1
have 1
put 1
them 1
into 1
your 1
head 1
Father 1
he 1
replied 1
do 1
listen 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
am 1
quite 1
innocent 1
He 1
was 1
standing 1
there 1
by 1
night 1
like 1
one 1
intent 1
on 1
doing 1
evil 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
and 1
I 1
entreated 1
him 1
three 1
times 1
either 1
to 1
speak 1
or 1
to 1
go 1
away 1
Ah 1
said 1
the 1
father 1
I 1
have 1
nothing 1
but 1
unhappiness 1
with 1
you 1
Go 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
sight 1
I 1
will 1
see 1
you 1
no 1
more 1
Yes 1
father 1
right 1
willingly 1
wait 1
only 1
until 1
it 1
is 1
day 1
Then 1
will 1
I 1
go 1
forth 1
and 1
learn 1
how 1
to 1
shudder 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
shall 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
understand 1
one 1
art 1
which 1
will 1
support 1
me 1
Learn 1
what 1
you 1
will 1
spoke 1
the 1
father 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
the 1
same 1
to 1
me 1
Here 1
are 1
fifty 1
talers 1
for 1
you 1
Take 1
these 1
and 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
wide 1
world 1
and 1
tell 1
no 1
one 1
from 1
whence 1
you 1
come 1
and 1
who 1
is 1
your 1
father 1
for 1
I 1
have 1
reason 1
to 1
be 1
ashamed 1
of 1
you 1
Yes 1
father 1
it 1
shall 1
be 1
as 1
you 1
will 1
If 1
you 1
desire 1
nothing 1
more 1
than 1
that 1
I 1
can 1
easily 1
keep 1
it 1
in 1
mind 1
When 1
the 1
day 1
dawned 1
therefore 1
the 1
boy 1
put 1
his 1
fifty 1
talers 1
into 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
went 1
forth 1
on 1
the 1
great 1
highway 1
and 1
continually 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
If 1
I 1
could 1
but 1
shudder 1
If 1
I 1
could 1
but 1
shudder 1
Then 1
a 1
man 1
approached 1
who 1
heard 1
this 1
conversation 1
which 1
the 1
youth 1
was 1
holding 1
with 1
himself 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
walked 1
a 1
little 1
farther 1
to 1
where 1
they 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
gallows 1
the 1
man 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
Look 1
there 1
is 1
the 1
tree 1
where 1
seven 1
men 1
have 1
married 1
the 1
ropemaker 1
s 1
daughter 1
and 1
are 1
now 1
learning 1
how 1
to 1
fly 1
Sit 1
down 1
beneath 1
it 1
and 1
wait 1
till 1
night 1
comes 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
soon 1
learn 1
how 1
to 1
shudder 1
If 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
wanted 1
answered 1
the 1
youth 1
it 1
is 1
easily 1
done 1
but 1
if 1
I 1
learn 1
how 1
to 1
shudder 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
that 1
you 1
shall 1
have 1
my 1
fifty 1
talers 1
Just 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
me 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
Then 1
the 1
youth 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
gallows 1
sat 1
down 1
beneath 1
it 1
and 1
waited 1
till 1
evening 1
came 1
And 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
cold 1
he 1
lighted 1
himself 1
a 1
fire 1
but 1
at 1
midnight 1
the 1
wind 1
blew 1
so 1
sharply 1
that 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
his 1
fire 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
get 1
warm 1
And 1
as 1
the 1
wind 1
knocked 1
the 1
hanged 1
men 1
against 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
they 1
moved 1
backwards 1
and 1
forwards 1
he 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
If 1
you 1
shiver 1
below 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
how 1
those 1
up 1
above 1
must 1
freeze 1
and 1
suffer 1
And 1
as 1
he 1
felt 1
pity 1
for 1
them 1
he 1
raised 1
the 1
ladder 1
and 1
climbed 1
up 1
unbound 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
after 1
the 1
other 1
and 1
brought 1
down 1
all 1
seven 1
Then 1
he 1
stoked 1
the 1
fire 1
blew 1
it 1
and 1
set 1
them 1
all 1
round 1
it 1
to 1
warm 1
themselves 1
But 1
they 1
sat 1
there 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
stir 1
and 1
the 1
fire 1
caught 1
their 1
clothes 1
So 1
he 1
said 1
Take 1
care 1
or 1
I 1
will 1
hang 1
you 1
up 1
again 1
The 1
dead 1
men 1
however 1
did 1
not 1
hear 1
but 1
were 1
quite 1
silent 1
and 1
let 1
their 1
rags 1
go 1
on 1
burning 1
At 1
this 1
he 1
grew 1
angry 1
and 1
said 1
If 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
take 1
care 1
I 1
cannot 1
help 1
you 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
burnt 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
he 1
hung 1
them 1
up 1
again 1
each 1
in 1
his 1
turn 1
Then 1
he 1
sat 1
down 1
by 1
his 1
fire 1
and 1
fell 1
asleep 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
the 1
man 1
came 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
fifty 1
talers 1
and 1
said 1
Well 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
shudder 1
No 1
answered 1
he 1
how 1
should 1
I 1
know 1
Those 1
fellows 1
up 1
there 1
did 1
not 1
open 1
their 1
mouths 1
and 1
were 1
so 1
stupid 1
that 1
they 1
let 1
the 1
few 1
old 1
rags 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
on 1
their 1
bodies 1
get 1
burnt 1
Then 1
the 1
man 1
saw 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
get 1
the 1
fifty 1
talers 1
that 1
day 1
and 1
went 1
away 1
saying 1
Such 1
a 1
youth 1
has 1
never 1
come 1
my 1
way 1
before 1
The 1
youth 1
likewise 1
went 1
his 1
way 1
and 1
once 1
more 1
began 1
to 1
mutter 1
to 1
himself 1
Ah 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
but 1
shudder 1
Ah 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
but 1
shudder 1
A 1
waggoner 1
who 1
was 1
striding 1
behind 1
him 1
heard 1
this 1
and 1
asked 1
Who 1
are 1
you 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
answered 1
the 1
youth 1
Then 1
the 1
waggoner 1
asked 1
From 1
whence 1
do 1
you 1
come 1
I 1
know 1
not 1
Who 1
is 1
your 1
father 1
That 1
I 1
may 1
not 1
tell 1
you 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
always 1
muttering 1
between 1
your 1
teeth 1
Ah 1
replied 1
the 1
youth 1
I 1
do 1
so 1
wish 1
I 1
could 1
shudder 1
but 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
teach 1
me 1
how 1
Enough 1
of 1
your 1
foolish 1
chatter 1
said 1
the 1
waggoner 1
Come 1
go 1
with 1
me 1
I 1
will 1
see 1
about 1
a 1
place 1
for 1
you 1
The 1
youth 1
went 1
with 1
the 1
waggoner 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
they 1
arrived 1
at 1
an 1
inn 1
where 1
they 1
wished 1
to 1
pass 1
the 1
night 1
Then 1
at 1
the 1
entrance 1
of 1
the 1
parlour 1
the 1
youth 1
again 1
said 1
quite 1
loudly 1
If 1
I 1
could 1
but 1
shudder 1
If 1
I 1
could 1
but 1
shudder 1
The 1
host 1
who 1
heard 1
this 1
laughed 1
and 1
said 1
If 1
that 1
is 1
your 1
desire 1
there 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
good 1
opportunity 1
for 1
you 1
here 1
Ah 1
be 1
silent 1
said 1
the 1
hostess 1
so 1
many 1
prying 1
persons 1
have 1
already 1
lost 1
their 1
lives 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
pity 1
and 1
a 1
shame 1
if 1
such 1
beautiful 1
eyes 1
as 1
these 1
should 1
never 1
see 1
the 1
daylight 1
again 1
But 1
the 1
youth 1
said 1
However 1
difficult 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
I 1
will 1
learn 1
it 1
For 1
this 1
purpose 1
indeed 1
have 1
I 1
journeyed 1
forth 1
He 1
let 1
the 1
host 1
have 1
no 1
rest 1
until 1
the 1
latter 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
not 1
far 1
from 1
thence 1
stood 1
a 1
haunted 1
castle 1
where 1
anyone 1
could 1
very 1
easily 1
learn 1
what 1
shuddering 1
was 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
but 1
watch 1
in 1
it 1
for 1
three 1
nights 1
The 1
king 1
had 1
promised 1
that 1
he 1
who 1
would 1
venture 1
should 1
have 1
his 1
daughter 1
to 1
wife 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
maiden 1
the 1
sun 1
shone 1
on 1
Likewise 1
in 1
the 1
castle 1
lay 1
great 1
treasures 1
which 1
were 1
guarded 1
by 1
evil 1
spirits 1
and 1
these 1
treasures 1
would 1
then 1
be 1
freed 1
and 1
would 1
make 1
a 1
poor 1
man 1
rich 1
enough 1
Already 1
many 1
men 1
had 1
gone 1
into 1
the 1
castle 1
but 1
as 1
yet 1
none 1
had 1
come 1
out 1
again 1
Then 1
the 1
youth 1
went 1
next 1
morning 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
said 1
If 1
it 1
be 1
allowed 1
I 1
will 1
willingly 1
watch 1
three 1
nights 1
in 1
the 1
haunted 1
castle 1
The 1
king 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
youth 1
pleased 1
him 1
he 1
said 1
You 1
may 1
ask 1
for 1
three 1
things 1
to 1
take 1
into 1
the 1
castle 1
with 1
you 1
but 1
they 1
must 1
be 1
things 1
without 1
life 1
Then 1
he 1
answered 1
Then 1
I 1
ask 1
for 1
a 1
fire 1
a 1
turning 1
lathe 1
and 1
a 1
cutting 1
board 1
with 1
the 1
knife 1
The 1
king 1
had 1
these 1
things 1
carried 1
into 1
the 1
castle 1
for 1
him 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
When 1
night 1
was 1
drawing 1
near 1
the 1
youth 1
went 1
up 1
and 1
made 1
himself 1
a 1
bright 1
fire 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
rooms 1
placed 1
the 1
cutting 1
board 1
and 1
knife 1
beside 1
it 1
and 1
seated 1
himself 1
by 1
the 1
turning 1
lathe 1
Ah 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
but 1
shudder 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
I 1
shall 1
not 1
learn 1
it 1
here 1
either 1
Towards 1
midnight 1
he 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
poke 1
his 1
fire 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
blowing 1
it 1
something 1
cried 1
suddenly 1
from 1
one 1
corner 1
Au 1
miau 1
how 1
cold 1
we 1
are 1
You 1
fools 1
cried 1
he 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
crying 1
about 1
If 1
you 1
are 1
cold 1
come 1
and 1
take 1
a 1
seat 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
warm 1
yourselves 1
And 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
said 1
that 1
two 1
great 1
black 1
cats 1
came 1
with 1
one 1
tremendous 1
leap 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
looked 1
savagely 1
at 1
him 1
with 1
their 1
fiery 1
eyes 1
After 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
warmed 1
themselves 1
they 1
said 1
Comrade 1
shall 1
we 1
have 1
a 1
game 1
of 1
cards 1
Why 1
not 1
he 1
replied 1
but 1
just 1
show 1
me 1
your 1
paws 1
Then 1
they 1
stretched 1
out 1
their 1
claws 1
Oh 1
said 1
he 1
what 1
long 1
nails 1
you 1
have 1
Wait 1
I 1
must 1
first 1
cut 1
them 1
for 1
you 1
Thereupon 1
he 1
seized 1
them 1
by 1
the 1
throats 1
put 1
them 1
on 1
the 1
cutting 1
board 1
and 1
screwed 1
their 1
feet 1
fast 1
I 1
have 1
looked 1
at 1
your 1
fingers 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
my 1
fancy 1
for 1
card 1
playing 1
has 1
gone 1
and 1
he 1
struck 1
them 1
dead 1
and 1
threw 1
them 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
But 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
made 1
away 1
with 1
these 1
two 1
and 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
sit 1
down 1
again 1
by 1
his 1
fire 1
out 1
from 1
every 1
hole 1
and 1
corner 1
came 1
black 1
cats 1
and 1
black 1
dogs 1
with 1
red 1
hot 1
chains 1
and 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
of 1
them 1
came 1
until 1
he 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
move 1
and 1
they 1
yelled 1
horribly 1
and 1
got 1
on 1
his 1
fire 1
pulled 1
it 1
to 1
pieces 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
put 1
it 1
out 1
He 1
watched 1
them 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
quietly 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
going 1
too 1
far 1
he 1
seized 1
his 1
cutting 1
knife 1
and 1
cried 1
Away 1
with 1
you 1
vermin 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
cut 1
them 1
down 1
Some 1
of 1
them 1
ran 1
away 1
the 1
others 1
he 1
killed 1
and 1
threw 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
fish 1
pond 1
When 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
he 1
fanned 1
the 1
embers 1
of 1
his 1
fire 1
again 1
and 1
warmed 1
himself 1
And 1
as 1
he 1
thus 1
sat 1
his 1
eyes 1
would 1
keep 1
open 1
no 1
longer 1
and 1
he 1
felt 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
sleep 1
Then 1
he 1
looked 1
round 1
and 1
saw 1
a 1
great 1
bed 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
very 1
thing 1
for 1
me 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
got 1
into 1
it 1
When 1
he 1
was 1
just 1
going 1
to 1
shut 1
his 1
eyes 1
however 1
the 1
bed 1
began 1
to 1
move 1
of 1
its 1
own 1
accord 1
and 1
went 1
over 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
the 1
castle 1
That 1
s 1
right 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
go 1
faster 1
Then 1
the 1
bed 1
rolled 1
on 1
as 1
if 1
six 1
horses 1
were 1
harnessed 1
to 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
over 1
thresholds 1
and 1
stairs 1
but 1
suddenly 1
hop 2
it 1
turned 1
over 1
upside 1
down 1
and 1
lay 1
on 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
mountain 1
But 1
he 1
threw 1
quilts 1
and 1
pillows 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
got 1
out 1
and 1
said 1
Now 1
anyone 1
who 1
likes 1
may 1
drive 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
by 1
his 1
fire 1
and 1
slept 1
till 1
it 1
was 1
day 1
In 1
the 1
morning 1
the 1
king 1
came 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
him 1
lying 1
there 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
he 1
thought 1
the 1
evil 1
spirits 1
had 1
killed 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
dead 1
Then 1
said 1
he 1
After 1
all 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
pity 1
for 1
so 1
handsome 1
a 1
man 1
The 1
youth 1
heard 1
it 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
said 1
It 1
has 1
not 1
come 1
to 1
that 1
yet 1
Then 1
the 1
king 1
was 1
astonished 1
but 1
very 1
glad 1
and 1
asked 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
fared 1
Very 1
well 1
indeed 1
answered 1
he 1
one 1
night 1
is 1
past 1
the 1
two 1
others 1
will 1
pass 1
likewise 1
Then 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
innkeeper 1
who 1
opened 1
his 1
eyes 1
very 1
wide 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
never 1
expected 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
alive 1
again 1
Have 1
you 1
learnt 1
how 1
to 1
shudder 1
yet 1
No 1
said 1
he 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
in 1
vain 1
If 1
someone 1
would 1
but 1
tell 1
me 1
The 1
second 1
night 1
he 1
again 1
went 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
old 1
castle 1
sat 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
once 1
more 1
began 1
his 1
old 1
song 1
If 1
I 1
could 1
but 1
shudder 1
When 1
midnight 1
came 1
an 1
uproar 1
and 1
noise 1
of 1
tumbling 1
about 1
was 1
heard 1
at 1
first 1
it 1
was 1
low 1
but 1
it 1
grew 1
louder 1
and 1
louder 1
Then 1
it 1
was 1
quiet 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
with 1
a 1
loud 1
scream 1
half 1
a 1
man 1
came 1
down 1
the 1
chimney 1
and 1
fell 1
before 1
him 1
Hullo 1
cried 1
he 1
another 1
half 1
belongs 1
to 1
this 1
This 1
is 1
not 1
enough 1
Then 1
the 1
uproar 1
began 1
again 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
roaring 1
and 1
howling 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
half 1
fell 1
down 1
likewise 1
Wait 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
will 1
just 1
stoke 1
up 1
the 1
fire 1
a 1
little 1
for 1
you 1
When 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
that 1
and 1
looked 1
round 1
again 1
the 1
two 1
pieces 1
were 1
joined 1
together 1
and 1
a 1
hideous 1
man 1
was 1
sitting 1
in 1
his 1
place 1
That 1
is 1
no 1
part 1
of 1
our 1
bargain 1
said 1
the 1
youth 1
the 1
bench 1
is 1
mine 1
The 1
man 1
wanted 1
to 1
push 1
him 1
away 1
the 1
youth 1
however 1
would 1
not 1
allow 1
that 1
but 1
thrust 1
him 1
off 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
strength 1
and 1
seated 1
himself 1
again 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
place 1
Then 1
still 1
more 1
men 1
fell 1
down 1
one 1
after 1
the 1
other 1
they 1
brought 1
nine 1
dead 1
men 1
s 1
legs 1
and 1
two 1
skulls 1
and 1
set 1
them 1
up 1
and 1
played 1
at 1
nine 1
pins 1
with 1
them 1
The 1
youth 1
also 1
wanted 1
to 1
play 1
and 1
said 1
Listen 1
you 1
can 1
I 1
join 1
you 1
Yes 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
any 1
money 1
Money 1
enough 1
replied 1
he 1
but 1
your 1
balls 1
are 1
not 1
quite 1
round 1
Then 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
skulls 1
and 1
put 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
lathe 1
and 1
turned 1
them 1
till 1
they 1
were 1
round 1
There 1
now 1
they 1
will 1
roll 1
better 1
said 1
he 1
Hurrah 1
now 1
we 1
ll 1
have 1
fun 1
He 1
played 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
lost 1
some 1
of 1
his 1
money 1
but 1
when 1
it 1
struck 1
twelve 1
everything 1
vanished 1
from 1
his 1
sight 1
He 1
lay 1
down 1
and 1
quietly 1
fell 1
asleep 1
Next 1
morning 1
the 1
king 1
came 1
to 1
inquire 1
after 1
him 1
How 1
has 1
it 1
fared 1
with 1
you 1
this 1
time 1
asked 1
he 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
playing 1
at 1
nine 1
pins 1
he 1
answered 1
and 1
have 1
lost 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
farthings 1
Have 1
you 1
not 1
shuddered 1
then 1
What 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
wonderful 1
time 1
If 1
I 1
did 1
but 1
know 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
shudder 1
The 1
third 1
night 1
he 1
sat 1
down 1
again 1
on 1
his 1
bench 1
and 1
said 1
quite 1
sadly 1
If 1
I 1
could 1
but 1
shudder 1
When 1
it 1
grew 1
late 1
six 1
tall 1
men 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
brought 1
a 1
coffin 1
Then 1
he 1
said 1
Ha 1
ha 1
that 1
is 1
certainly 1
my 1
little 1
cousin 1
who 1
died 1
only 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
ago 1
and 1
he 1
beckoned 1
with 1
his 1
finger 1
and 1
cried 1
Come 1
little 1
cousin 1
come 1
They 1
placed 1
the 1
coffin 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
but 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
lid 1
off 1
and 1
a 1
dead 1
man 1
lay 1
therein 1
He 1
felt 1
his 1
face 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
cold 1
as 1
ice 1
Wait 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
will 1
warm 1
you 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
warmed 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
laid 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
dead 1
man 1
s 1
face 1
but 1
he 1
remained 1
cold 1
Then 1
he 1
took 1
him 1
out 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
laid 1
him 1
on 1
his 1
breast 1
and 1
rubbed 1
his 1
arms 1
that 1
the 1
blood 1
might 1
circulate 1
again 1
As 1
this 1
also 1
did 1
no 1
good 1
he 1
thought 1
to 1
himself 1
When 1
two 1
people 1
lie 1
in 1
bed 1
together 1
they 1
warm 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
carried 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
bed 1
covered 1
him 1
over 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
by 1
him 1
After 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
the 1
dead 1
man 1
became 1
warm 1
too 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
move 1
Then 1
said 1
the 1
youth 1
See 1
little 1
cousin 1
have 1
I 1
not 1
warmed 1
you 1
The 1
dead 1
man 1
however 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
cried 1
Now 1
will 1
I 1
strangle 1
you 1
What 1
said 1
he 1
is 1
that 1
the 1
way 1
you 1
thank 1
me 1
You 1
shall 1
at 1
once 1
go 1
into 1
your 1
coffin 1
again 1
and 1
he 1
took 1
him 1
up 1
threw 1
him 1
into 1
it 1
and 1
shut 1
the 1
lid 1
Then 1
came 1
the 1
six 1
men 1
and 1
carried 1
him 1
away 1
again 1
I 1
cannot 1
manage 1
to 1
shudder 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
shall 1
never 1
learn 1
it 1
here 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
I 1
live 1
Then 1
a 1
man 1
entered 1
who 1
was 1
taller 1
than 1
all 1
others 1
and 1
looked 1
terrible 1
He 1
was 1
old 1
however 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
long 1
white 1
beard 1
You 1
wretch 1
cried 1
he 1
you 1
shall 1
soon 1
learn 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
shudder 1
for 1
you 1
shall 1
die 1
Not 1
so 1
fast 1
replied 1
the 1
youth 1
If 1
I 1
am 1
to 1
die 1
I 1
shall 1
have 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
say 1
in 1
it 1
I 1
will 1
soon 1
seize 1
you 1
said 1
the 1
fiend 1
Softly 1
softly 1
do 1
not 1
talk 1
so 1
big 1
I 1
am 1
as 1
strong 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
and 1
perhaps 1
even 1
stronger 1
We 1
shall 1
see 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
If 1
you 1
are 1
stronger 1
I 1
will 1
let 1
you 1
go 1
come 1
we 1
will 1
try 1
Then 1
he 1
led 1
him 1
by 1
dark 1
passages 1
to 1
a 1
smith 1
s 1
forge 1
took 1
an 1
axe 1
and 1
with 1
one 1
blow 1
struck 1
an 1
anvil 1
into 1
the 1
ground 1
I 1
can 1
do 1
better 1
than 1
that 1
said 1
the 1
youth 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
anvil 1
The 1
old 1
man 1
placed 1
himself 1
near 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
look 1
on 1
and 1
his 1
white 1
beard 1
hung 1
down 1
Then 1
the 1
youth 1
seized 1
the 1
axe 1
split 1
the 1
anvil 1
with 1
one 1
blow 1
and 1
in 1
it 1
caught 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
s 1
beard 1
Now 1
I 1
have 1
you 1
said 1
the 1
youth 1
Now 1
it 1
is 1
your 1
turn 1
to 1
die 1
Then 1
he 1
seized 1
an 1
iron 1
bar 1
and 1
beat 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
till 1
he 1
moaned 1
and 1
entreated 1
him 1
to 1
stop 1
when 1
he 1
would 1
give 1
him 1
great 1
riches 1
The 1
youth 1
drew 1
out 1
the 1
axe 1
and 1
let 1
him 1
go 1
The 1
old 1
man 1
led 1
him 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
castle 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
cellar 1
showed 1
him 1
three 1
chests 1
full 1
of 1
gold 1
Of 1
these 1
said 1
he 1
one 1
part 1
is 1
for 1
the 1
poor 1
the 1
other 1
for 1
the 1
king 1
the 1
third 1
yours 1
In 1
the 1
meantime 1
it 1
struck 1
twelve 1
and 1
the 1
spirit 1
disappeared 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
youth 1
stood 1
in 1
darkness 1
I 1
shall 1
still 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
find 1
my 1
way 1
out 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
felt 1
about 1
found 1
the 1
way 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
slept 1
there 1
by 1
his 1
fire 1
Next 1
morning 1
the 1
king 1
came 1
and 1
said 1
Now 1
you 1
must 1
have 1
learnt 1
what 1
shuddering 1
is 1
No 1
he 1
answered 1
what 1
can 1
it 1
be 1
My 1
dead 1
cousin 1
was 1
here 1
and 1
a 1
bearded 1
man 1
came 1
and 1
showed 1
me 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
money 1
down 1
below 1
but 1
no 1
one 1
told 1
me 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
shudder 1
Then 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
you 1
have 1
saved 1
the 1
castle 1
and 1
shall 1
marry 1
my 1
daughter 1
That 1
is 1
all 1
very 1
well 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
still 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
shudder 1
Then 1
the 1
gold 1
was 1
brought 1
up 1
and 1
the 1
wedding 1
celebrated 1
but 1
howsoever 1
much 1
the 1
young 1
king 1
loved 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
however 1
happy 1
he 1
was 1
he 1
still 1
said 1
always 1
If 1
I 1
could 1
but 1
shudder 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
but 1
shudder 1
And 1
this 1
at 1
last 1
angered 1
her 1
Her 1
waiting 1
maid 1
said 1
I 1
will 1
find 1
a 1
cure 1
for 1
him 1
he 1
shall 1
soon 1
learn 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
shudder 1
She 1
went 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
stream 1
which 1
flowed 1
through 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
whole 1
bucketful 1
of 1
gudgeons 1
brought 1
to 1
her 1
At 1
night 1
when 1
the 1
young 1
king 1
was 1
sleeping 1
his 1
wife 1
was 1
to 1
draw 1
the 1
clothes 1
off 1
him 1
and 1
empty 1
the 1
bucket 1
full 1
of 1
cold 1
water 1
with 1
the 1
gudgeons 1
in 1
it 1
over 1
him 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
little 1
fishes 1
would 1
sprawl 1
about 1
him 1
Then 1
he 1
woke 1
up 1
and 1
cried 1
Oh 1
what 1
makes 1
me 1
shudder 1
so 1
what 1
makes 1
me 1
shudder 1
so 1
dear 1
wife 1
Ah 1
now 1
I 1
know 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
shudder 1
KING 1
GRISLY 1
BEARD 1
A 1
great 1
king 1
of 1
a 1
land 1
far 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
East 1
had 1
a 1
daughter 1
who 1
was 1
very 1
beautiful 1
but 1
so 1
proud 1
and 1
haughty 1
and 1
conceited 1
that 1
none 1
of 1
the 1
princes 1
who 1
came 1
to 1
ask 1
her 1
in 1
marriage 1
was 1
good 1
enough 1
for 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
only 1
made 1
sport 1
of 1
them 1
Once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
the 1
king 1
held 1
a 1
great 1
feast 1
and 1
asked 1
thither 1
all 1
her 1
suitors 1
and 1
they 1
all 1
sat 1
in 1
a 1
row 1
ranged 1
according 1
to 1
their 1
rank 1
kings 1
and 1
princes 1
and 1
dukes 1
and 1
earls 1
and 1
counts 1
and 1
barons 1
and 1
knights 1
Then 1
the 1
princess 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
passed 1
by 1
them 1
she 1
had 1
something 1
spiteful 1
to 1
say 1
to 1
every 1
one 1
The 1
first 1
was 1
too 1
fat 1
He 1
s 1
as 1
round 1
as 1
a 1
tub 1
said 1
she 1
The 1
next 1
was 1
too 1
tall 1
What 1
a 1
maypole 1
said 1
she 1
The 1
next 1
was 1
too 1
short 1
What 1
a 1
dumpling 1
said 1
she 1
The 1
fourth 1
was 1
too 1
pale 1
and 1
she 1
called 1
him 1
Wallface 1
The 1
fifth 1
was 1
too 1
red 1
so 1
she 1
called 1
him 1
Coxcomb 1
The 1
sixth 1
was 1
not 1
straight 1
enough 1
so 1
she 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
like 1
a 1
green 1
stick 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
laid 1
to 1
dry 1
over 1
a 1
baker 1
s 1
oven 1
And 1
thus 1
she 1
had 1
some 1
joke 1
to 1
crack 1
upon 1
every 1
one 1
but 1
she 1
laughed 1
more 1
than 1
all 1
at 1
a 1
good 1
king 1
who 1
was 1
there 1
Look 1
at 1
him 1
said 1
she 1
his 1
beard 1
is 1
like 1
an 1
old 1
mop 1
he 1
shall 1
be 1
called 1
Grisly 1
beard 1
So 1
the 1
king 1
got 1
the 1
nickname 1
of 1
Grisly 1
beard 1
But 1
the 1
old 1
king 1
was 1
very 1
angry 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
how 1
his 1
daughter 1
behaved 1
and 1
how 1
she 1
ill 1
treated 1
all 1
his 1
guests 1
and 1
he 1
vowed 1
that 1
willing 1
or 1
unwilling 1
she 1
should 1
marry 1
the 1
first 1
man 1
be 1
he 1
prince 1
or 1
beggar 1
that 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
Two 1
days 1
after 1
there 1
came 1
by 1
a 1
travelling 1
fiddler 1
who 1
began 1
to 1
play 1
under 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
beg 1
alms 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
heard 1
him 1
he 1
said 1
Let 1
him 1
come 1
in 1
So 1
they 1
brought 1
in 1
a 1
dirty 1
looking 1
fellow 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
sung 1
before 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
he 1
begged 1
a 1
boon 1
Then 1
the 1
king 1
said 1
You 1
have 1
sung 1
so 1
well 1
that 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
my 1
daughter 1
for 1
your 1
wife 1
The 1
princess 1
begged 1
and 1
prayed 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
said 1
I 1
have 1
sworn 1
to 1
give 1
you 1
to 1
the 1
first 1
comer 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
keep 1
my 1
word 1
So 1
words 1
and 1
tears 1
were 1
of 1
no 1
avail 1
the 1
parson 1
was 1
sent 1
for 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
married 1
to 1
the 1
fiddler 1
When 1
this 1
was 1
over 1
the 1
king 1
said 1
Now 1
get 1
ready 1
to 1
go 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
stay 1
here 1
you 1
must 1
travel 1
on 1
with 1
your 1
husband 1
Then 1
the 1
fiddler 1
went 1
his 1
way 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
they 1
soon 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
great 1
wood 1
Pray 1
said 1
she 1
whose 1
is 1
this 1
wood 1
It 1
belongs 1
to 1
King 1
Grisly 1
beard 1
answered 1
he 1
hadst 1
thou 1
taken 1
him 1
all 1
had 1
been 1
thine 1
Ah 1
unlucky 1
wretch 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
sighed 1
she 1
would 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
married 1
King 1
Grisly 1
beard 1
Next 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
some 1
fine 1
meadows 1
Whose 1
are 1
these 1
beautiful 1
green 1
meadows 1
said 1
she 1
They 1
belong 1
to 1
King 1
Grisly 1
beard 1
hadst 1
thou 1
taken 1
him 1
they 1
had 1
all 1
been 1
thine 1
Ah 1
unlucky 1
wretch 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
said 1
she 1
would 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
married 1
King 1
Grisly 1
beard 1
Then 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
great 1
city 1
Whose 1
is 1
this 1
noble 1
city 1
said 1
she 1
It 1
belongs 1
to 1
King 1
Grisly 1
beard 1
hadst 1
thou 1
taken 1
him 1
it 1
had 1
all 1
been 1
thine 1
Ah 1
wretch 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
sighed 1
she 1
why 1
did 1
I 1
not 1
marry 1
King 1
Grisly 1
beard 1
That 1
is 1
no 1
business 1
of 1
mine 1
said 1
the 1
fiddler 1
why 1
should 1
you 1
wish 1
for 1
another 1
husband 1
Am 1
not 1
I 1
good 1
enough 1
for 1
you 1
At 1
last 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
small 1
cottage 1
What 1
a 1
paltry 1
place 1
said 1
she 1
to 1
whom 1
does 1
that 1
little 1
dirty 1
hole 1
belong 1
Then 1
the 1
fiddler 1
said 1
That 1
is 1
your 1
and 1
my 1
house 1
where 1
we 1
are 1
to 1
live 1
Where 1
are 1
your 1
servants 1
cried 1
she 1
What 1
do 1
we 1
want 1
with 1
servants 1
said 1
he 1
you 1
must 1
do 1
for 1
yourself 1
whatever 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
Now 1
make 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
put 1
on 1
water 1
and 1
cook 1
my 1
supper 1
for 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
tired 1
But 1
the 1
princess 1
knew 1
nothing 1
of 1
making 1
fires 1
and 1
cooking 1
and 1
the 1
fiddler 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
help 1
her 1
When 1
they 1
had 1
eaten 1
a 1
very 1
scanty 1
meal 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
but 1
the 1
fiddler 1
called 1
her 1
up 1
very 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
to 1
clean 1
the 1
house 1
Thus 1
they 1
lived 1
for 1
two 1
days 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
eaten 1
up 1
all 1
there 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
cottage 1
the 1
man 1
said 1
Wife 1
we 1
can 1
t 1
go 1
on 1
thus 1
spending 1
money 1
and 1
earning 1
nothing 1
You 1
must 1
learn 1
to 1
weave 1
baskets 1
Then 1
he 1
went 1
out 1
and 1
cut 1
willows 1
and 1
brought 1
them 1
home 1
and 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
weave 1
but 1
it 1
made 1
her 1
fingers 1
very 1
sore 1
I 1
see 1
this 1
work 1
won 1
t 1
do 1
said 1
he 1
try 1
and 1
spin 1
perhaps 1
you 1
will 1
do 1
that 1
better 1
So 1
she 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
spin 1
but 1
the 1
threads 1
cut 1
her 1
tender 1
fingers 1
till 1
the 1
blood 1
ran 1
See 1
now 1
said 1
the 1
fiddler 1
you 1
are 1
good 1
for 1
nothing 1
you 1
can 1
do 1
no 1
work 1
what 1
a 1
bargain 1
I 1
have 1
got 1
However 1
I 1
ll 1
try 1
and 1
set 1
up 1
a 1
trade 1
in 1
pots 1
and 1
pans 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
stand 1
in 1
the 1
market 1
and 1
sell 1
them 1
Alas 1
sighed 1
she 1
if 1
any 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
court 1
should 1
pass 1
by 1
and 1
see 1
me 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
market 1
how 1
they 1
will 1
laugh 1
at 1
me 1
But 1
her 1
husband 1
did 1
not 1
care 1
for 1
that 1
and 1
said 1
she 1
must 1
work 1
if 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
die 1
of 1
hunger 1
At 1
first 1
the 1
trade 1
went 1
well 1
for 1
many 1
people 1
seeing 1
such 1
a 1
beautiful 1
woman 1
went 1
to 1
buy 1
her 1
wares 1
and 1
paid 1
their 1
money 1
without 1
thinking 1
of 1
taking 1
away 1
the 1
goods 1
They 1
lived 1
on 1
this 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
it 1
lasted 1
and 1
then 1
her 1
husband 1
bought 1
a 1
fresh 1
lot 1
of 1
ware 1
and 1
she 1
sat 1
herself 1
down 1
with 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
market 1
but 1
a 1
drunken 1
soldier 1
soon 1
came 1
by 1
and 1
rode 1
his 1
horse 1
against 1
her 1
stall 1
and 1
broke 1
all 1
her 1
goods 1
into 1
a 1
thousand 1
pieces 1
Then 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
cry 1
and 1
knew 1
not 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
Ah 1
what 1
will 1
become 1
of 1
me 1
said 1
she 1
what 1
will 1
my 1
husband 1
say 1
So 1
she 1
ran 1
home 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
all 1
Who 1
would 1
have 1
thought 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
silly 1
said 1
he 1
as 1
to 1
put 1
an 1
earthenware 1
stall 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
market 1
where 1
everybody 1
passes 1
but 1
let 1
us 1
have 1
no 1
more 1
crying 1
I 1
see 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
fit 1
for 1
this 1
sort 1
of 1
work 1
so 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
palace 1
and 1
asked 1
if 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
a 1
kitchen 1
maid 1
and 1
they 1
say 1
they 1
will 1
take 1
you 1
and 1
there 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
plenty 1
to 1
eat 1
Thus 1
the 1
princess 1
became 1
a 1
kitchen 1
maid 1
and 1
helped 1
the 1
cook 1
to 1
do 1
all 1
the 1
dirtiest 1
work 1
but 1
she 1
was 1
allowed 1
to 1
carry 1
home 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
meat 1
that 1
was 1
left 1
and 1
on 1
this 1
they 1
lived 1
She 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
there 1
long 1
before 1
she 1
heard 1
that 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
eldest 1
son 1
was 1
passing 1
by 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
and 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
windows 1
and 1
looked 1
out 1
Everything 1
was 1
ready 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
pomp 1
and 1
brightness 1
of 1
the 1
court 1
was 1
there 1
Then 1
she 1
bitterly 1
grieved 1
for 1
the 1
pride 1
and 1
folly 1
which 1
had 1
brought 1
her 1
so 1
low 1
And 1
the 1
servants 1
gave 1
her 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
rich 1
meats 1
which 1
she 1
put 1
into 1
her 1
basket 1
to 1
take 1
home 1
All 1
on 1
a 1
sudden 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
going 1
out 1
in 1
came 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
in 1
golden 1
clothes 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
beautiful 1
woman 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
took 1
her 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
said 1
she 1
should 1
be 1
his 1
partner 1
in 1
the 1
dance 1
but 1
she 1
trembled 1
for 1
fear 1
for 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
King 1
Grisly 1
beard 1
who 1
was 1
making 1
sport 1
of 1
her 1
However 1
he 1
kept 1
fast 1
hold 1
and 1
led 1
her 1
in 1
and 1
the 1
cover 1
of 1
the 1
basket 1
came 1
off 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
meats 1
in 1
it 1
fell 1
about 1
Then 1
everybody 1
laughed 1
and 1
jeered 1
at 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
abashed 1
that 1
she 1
wished 1
herself 1
a 1
thousand 1
feet 1
deep 1
in 1
the 1
earth 1
She 1
sprang 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
steps 1
King 1
Grisly 1
beard 1
overtook 1
her 1
and 1
brought 1
her 1
back 1
and 1
said 1
Fear 1
me 1
not 1
I 1
am 1
the 1
fiddler 1
who 1
has 1
lived 1
with 1
you 1
in 1
the 1
hut 1
I 1
brought 1
you 1
there 1
because 1
I 1
really 1
loved 1
you 1
I 1
am 1
also 1
the 1
soldier 1
that 1
overset 1
your 1
stall 1
I 1
have 1
done 1
all 1
this 1
only 1
to 1
cure 1
you 1
of 1
your 1
silly 1
pride 1
and 1
to 1
show 1
you 1
the 1
folly 1
of 1
your 1
ill 1
treatment 1
of 1
me 1
Now 1
all 1
is 1
over 1
you 1
have 1
learnt 1
wisdom 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
time 1
to 1
hold 1
our 1
marriage 1
feast 1
Then 1
the 1
chamberlains 1
came 1
and 1
brought 1
her 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
robes 1
and 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
his 1
whole 1
court 1
were 1
there 1
already 1
and 1
welcomed 1
her 1
home 1
on 1
her 1
marriage 1
Joy 1
was 1
in 1
every 1
face 1
and 1
every 1
heart 1
The 1
feast 1
was 1
grand 1
they 1
danced 1
and 1
sang 1
all 1
were 1
merry 1
and 1
I 1
only 1
wish 1
that 1
you 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
of 1
the 1
party 1
IRON 1
HANS 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
a 1
king 1
who 1
had 1
a 1
great 1
forest 1
near 1
his 1
palace 1
full 1
of 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
wild 1
animals 1
One 1
day 1
he 1
sent 1
out 1
a 1
huntsman 1
to 1
shoot 1
him 1
a 1
roe 1
but 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
back 1
Perhaps 1
some 1
accident 1
has 1
befallen 1
him 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
he 1
sent 1
out 1
two 1
more 1
huntsmen 1
who 1
were 1
to 1
search 1
for 1
him 1
but 1
they 1
too 1
stayed 1
away 1
Then 1
on 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
he 1
sent 1
for 1
all 1
his 1
huntsmen 1
and 1
said 1
Scour 1
the 1
whole 1
forest 1
through 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
give 1
up 1
until 1
you 1
have 1
found 1
all 1
three 1
But 1
of 1
these 1
also 1
none 1
came 1
home 1
again 1
none 1
were 1
seen 1
again 1
From 1
that 1
time 1
forth 1
no 1
one 1
would 1
any 1
longer 1
venture 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
it 1
lay 1
there 1
in 1
deep 1
stillness 1
and 1
solitude 1
and 1
nothing 1
was 1
seen 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
sometimes 1
an 1
eagle 1
or 1
a 1
hawk 1
flying 1
over 1
it 1
This 1
lasted 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
when 1
an 1
unknown 1
huntsman 1
announced 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
as 1
seeking 1
a 1
situation 1
and 1
offered 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
dangerous 1
forest 1
The 1
king 1
however 1
would 1
not 1
give 1
his 1
consent 1
and 1
said 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
safe 1
in 1
there 1
I 1
fear 1
it 1
would 1
fare 1
with 1
you 1
no 1
better 1
than 1
with 1
the 1
others 1
and 1
you 1
would 1
never 1
come 1
out 1
again 1
The 1
huntsman 1
replied 1
Lord 1
I 1
will 1
venture 1
it 1
at 1
my 1
own 1
risk 1
of 1
fear 1
I 1
know 1
nothing 1
The 1
huntsman 1
therefore 1
betook 1
himself 1
with 1
his 1
dog 1
to 1
the 1
forest 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
the 1
dog 1
fell 1
in 1
with 1
some 1
game 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
pursue 1
it 1
but 1
hardly 1
had 1
the 1
dog 1
run 1
two 1
steps 1
when 1
it 1
stood 1
before 1
a 1
deep 1
pool 1
could 1
go 1
no 1
farther 1
and 1
a 1
naked 1
arm 1
stretched 1
itself 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
seized 1
it 1
and 1
drew 1
it 1
under 1
When 1
the 1
huntsman 1
saw 1
that 1
he 1
went 1
back 1
and 1
fetched 1
three 1
men 1
to 1
come 1
with 1
buckets 1
and 1
bale 1
out 1
the 1
water 1
When 1
they 1
could 1
see 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
there 1
lay 1
a 1
wild 1
man 1
whose 1
body 1
was 1
brown 1
like 1
rusty 1
iron 1
and 1
whose 1
hair 1
hung 1
over 1
his 1
face 1
down 1
to 1
his 1
knees 1
They 1
bound 1
him 1
with 1
cords 1
and 1
led 1
him 1
away 1
to 1
the 1
castle 1
There 1
was 1
great 1
astonishment 1
over 1
the 1
wild 1
man 1
the 1
king 1
however 1
had 1
him 1
put 1
in 1
an 1
iron 1
cage 1
in 1
his 1
courtyard 1
and 1
forbade 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
be 1
opened 1
on 1
pain 1
of 1
death 1
and 1
the 1
queen 1
herself 1
was 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
key 1
into 1
her 1
keeping 1
And 1
from 1
this 1
time 1
forth 1
everyone 1
could 1
again 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
with 1
safety 1
The 1
king 1
had 1
a 1
son 1
of 1
eight 1
years 1
who 1
was 1
once 1
playing 1
in 1
the 1
courtyard 1
and 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
playing 1
his 1
golden 1
ball 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
cage 1
The 1
boy 1
ran 1
thither 1
and 1
said 1
Give 1
me 1
my 1
ball 1
out 1
Not 1
till 1
you 1
have 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
for 1
me 1
answered 1
the 1
man 1
No 1
said 1
the 1
boy 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
do 1
that 1
the 1
king 1
has 1
forbidden 1
it 1
and 1
ran 1
away 1
The 1
next 1
day 1
he 1
again 1
went 1
and 1
asked 1
for 1
his 1
ball 1
the 1
wild 1
man 1
said 1
Open 1
my 1
door 1
but 1
the 1
boy 1
would 1
not 1
On 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
the 1
king 1
had 1
ridden 1
out 1
hunting 1
and 1
the 1
boy 1
went 1
once 1
more 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
cannot 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
even 1
if 1
I 1
wished 1
for 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
the 1
key 1
Then 1
the 1
wild 1
man 1
said 1
It 1
lies 1
under 1
your 1
mother 1
s 1
pillow 1
you 1
can 1
get 1
it 1
there 1
The 1
boy 1
who 1
wanted 1
to 1
have 1
his 1
ball 1
back 1
cast 1
all 1
thought 1
to 1
the 1
winds 1
and 1
brought 1
the 1
key 1
The 1
door 1
opened 1
with 1
difficulty 1
and 1
the 1
boy 1
pinched 1
his 1
fingers 1
When 1
it 1
was 1
open 1
the 1
wild 1
man 1
stepped 1
out 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
golden 1
ball 1
and 1
hurried 1
away 1
The 1
boy 1
had 1
become 1
afraid 1
he 1
called 1
and 1
cried 1
after 1
him 1
Oh 1
wild 1
man 1
do 1
not 1
go 1
away 1
or 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
beaten 1
The 1
wild 1
man 1
turned 1
back 1
took 1
him 1
up 1
set 1
him 1
on 1
his 1
shoulder 1
and 1
went 1
with 1
hasty 1
steps 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
When 1
the 1
king 1
came 1
home 1
he 1
observed 1
the 1
empty 1
cage 1
and 1
asked 1
the 1
queen 1
how 1
that 1
had 1
happened 1
She 1
knew 1
nothing 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
sought 1
the 1
key 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
gone 1
She 1
called 1
the 1
boy 1
but 1
no 1
one 1
answered 1
The 1
king 1
sent 1
out 1
people 1
to 1
seek 1
for 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
fields 1
but 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
find 1
him 1
Then 1
he 1
could 1
easily 1
guess 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
and 1
much 1
grief 1
reigned 1
in 1
the 1
royal 1
court 1
When 1
the 1
wild 1
man 1
had 1
once 1
more 1
reached 1
the 1
dark 1
forest 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
boy 1
down 1
from 1
his 1
shoulder 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
You 1
will 1
never 1
see 1
your 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
again 1
but 1
I 1
will 1
keep 1
you 1
with 1
me 1
for 1
you 1
have 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
compassion 1
on 1
you 1
If 1
you 1
do 1
all 1
I 1
bid 1
you 2
shall 1
fare 1
well 1
Of 1
treasure 1
and 1
gold 1
have 1
I 1
enough 1
and 1
more 1
than 1
anyone 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
He 1
made 1
a 1
bed 1
of 1
moss 1
for 1
the 1
boy 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
slept 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
the 1
man 1
took 1
him 1
to 1
a 1
well 1
and 1
said 1
Behold 1
the 1
gold 1
well 1
is 1
as 1
bright 1
and 1
clear 1
as 1
crystal 1
you 1
shall 1
sit 1
beside 1
it 1
and 1
take 1
care 1
that 1
nothing 1
falls 1
into 1
it 1
or 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
polluted 1
I 1
will 1
come 1
every 1
evening 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
obeyed 1
my 1
order 1
The 1
boy 1
placed 1
himself 1
by 1
the 1
brink 1
of 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
often 1
saw 1
a 1
golden 1
fish 1
or 1
a 1
golden 1
snake 1
show 1
itself 1
therein 1
and 1
took 1
care 1
that 1
nothing 1
fell 1
in 1
As 1
he 1
was 1
thus 1
sitting 1
his 1
finger 1
hurt 1
him 1
so 1
violently 1
that 1
he 1
involuntarily 1
put 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
He 1
drew 1
it 1
quickly 1
out 1
again 1
but 1
saw 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
gilded 1
and 1
whatsoever 1
pains 1
he 1
took 1
to 1
wash 1
the 1
gold 1
off 1
again 1
all 1
was 1
to 1
no 1
purpose 1
In 1
the 1
evening 1
Iron 1
Hans 1
came 1
back 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
boy 1
and 1
said 1
What 1
has 1
happened 1
to 1
the 1
well 1
Nothing 1
nothing 1
he 1
answered 1
and 1
held 1
his 1
finger 1
behind 1
his 1
back 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
might 1
not 1
see 1
it 1
But 1
he 1
said 1
You 1
have 1
dipped 1
your 1
finger 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
this 1
time 1
it 1
may 1
pass 1
but 1
take 1
care 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
again 1
let 1
anything 1
go 1
in 1
By 1
daybreak 1
the 1
boy 1
was 1
already 1
sitting 1
by 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
watching 1
it 1
His 1
finger 1
hurt 1
him 1
again 1
and 1
he 1
passed 1
it 1
over 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
then 1
unhappily 1
a 1
hair 1
fell 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
well 1
He 1
took 1
it 1
quickly 1
out 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
already 1
quite 1
gilded 1
Iron 1
Hans 1
came 1
and 1
already 1
knew 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
You 1
have 1
let 1
a 1
hair 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
well 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
will 1
allow 1
you 1
to 1
watch 1
by 1
it 1
once 1
more 1
but 1
if 1
this 1
happens 1
for 1
the 1
third 1
time 1
then 1
the 1
well 1
is 1
polluted 1
and 1
you 1
can 1
no 1
longer 1
remain 1
with 1
me 1
On 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
the 1
boy 1
sat 1
by 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
stir 1
his 1
finger 1
however 1
much 1
it 1
hurt 1
him 1
But 1
the 1
time 1
was 1
long 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
reflection 1
of 1
his 1
face 1
on 1
the 1
surface 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
And 1
as 1
he 1
still 1
bent 1
down 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
doing 1
so 1
and 1
trying 1
to 1
look 1
straight 1
into 1
the 1
eyes 1
his 1
long 1
hair 1
fell 1
down 1
from 1
his 1
shoulders 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
He 1
raised 1
himself 1
up 1
quickly 1
but 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
the 1
hair 1
of 1
his 1
head 1
was 1
already 1
golden 1
and 1
shone 1
like 1
the 1
sun 1
You 1
can 1
imagine 1
how 1
terrified 1
the 1
poor 1
boy 1
was 1
He 1
took 1
his 1
pocket 1
handkerchief 1
and 1
tied 1
it 1
round 1
his 1
head 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
might 1
not 1
see 1
it 1
When 1
he 1
came 1
he 1
already 1
knew 1
everything 1
and 1
said 1
Take 1
the 1
handkerchief 1
off 1
Then 1
the 1
golden 1
hair 1
streamed 1
forth 1
and 1
let 1
the 1
boy 1
excuse 1
himself 1
as 1
he 1
might 1
it 1
was 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
You 1
have 1
not 1
stood 1
the 1
trial 1
and 1
can 1
stay 1
here 1
no 1
longer 1
Go 1
forth 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
there 1
you 1
will 1
learn 1
what 1
poverty 1
is 1
But 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
not 1
a 1
bad 1
heart 1
and 1
as 1
I 1
mean 1
well 1
by 1
you 1
there 1
is 1
one 1
thing 1
I 1
will 1
grant 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
fall 1
into 1
any 1
difficulty 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
cry 1
Iron 1
Hans 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
will 1
come 1
and 1
help 1
you 1
My 1
power 1
is 1
great 1
greater 1
than 1
you 1
think 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
gold 1
and 1
silver 1
in 1
abundance 1
Then 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
left 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
walked 1
by 1
beaten 1
and 1
unbeaten 1
paths 1
ever 1
onwards 1
until 1
at 1
length 1
he 1
reached 1
a 1
great 1
city 1
There 1
he 1
looked 1
for 1
work 1
but 1
could 1
find 1
none 1
and 1
he 1
learnt 1
nothing 1
by 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
help 1
himself 1
At 1
length 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
palace 1
and 1
asked 1
if 1
they 1
would 1
take 1
him 1
in 1
The 1
people 1
about 1
court 1
did 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
know 1
what 1
use 1
they 1
could 1
make 1
of 1
him 1
but 1
they 1
liked 1
him 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
to 1
stay 1
At 1
length 1
the 1
cook 1
took 1
him 1
into 1
his 1
service 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
might 1
carry 1
wood 1
and 1
water 1
and 1
rake 1
the 1
cinders 1
together 1
Once 1
when 1
it 1
so 1
happened 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
was 1
at 1
hand 1
the 1
cook 1
ordered 1
him 1
to 1
carry 1
the 1
food 1
to 1
the 1
royal 1
table 1
but 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
to 1
let 1
his 1
golden 1
hair 1
be 1
seen 1
he 1
kept 1
his 1
little 1
cap 1
on 1
Such 1
a 1
thing 1
as 1
that 1
had 1
never 1
yet 1
come 1
under 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
notice 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
When 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
royal 1
table 1
you 1
must 1
take 1
your 1
hat 1
off 1
He 1
answered 1
Ah 1
Lord 1
I 1
cannot 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
bad 1
sore 1
place 1
on 1
my 1
head 1
Then 1
the 1
king 1
had 1
the 1
cook 1
called 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
scolded 1
him 1
and 1
asked 1
how 1
he 1
could 1
take 1
such 1
a 1
boy 1
as 1
that 1
into 1
his 1
service 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
send 1
him 1
away 1
at 1
once 1
The 1
cook 1
however 1
had 1
pity 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
exchanged 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
gardener 1
s 1
boy 1
And 1
now 1
the 1
boy 1
had 1
to 1
plant 1
and 1
water 1
the 1
garden 1
hoe 1
and 1
dig 1
and 1
bear 1
the 1
wind 1
and 1
bad 1
weather 1
Once 1
in 1
summer 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
working 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
the 1
day 1
was 1
so 1
warm 1
he 1
took 1
his 1
little 1
cap 1
off 1
that 1
the 1
air 1
might 1
cool 1
him 1
As 1
the 1
sun 1
shone 1
on 1
his 1
hair 1
it 1
glittered 1
and 1
flashed 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
rays 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
bedroom 1
of 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
and 1
up 1
she 1
sprang 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
that 1
could 1
be 1
Then 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
boy 1
and 1
cried 1
to 1
him 1
Boy 1
bring 1
me 1
a 1
wreath 1
of 1
flowers 1
He 1
put 1
his 1
cap 1
on 1
with 1
all 1
haste 1
and 1
gathered 1
wild 1
field 1
flowers 1
and 1
bound 1
them 1
together 1
When 1
he 1
was 1
ascending 1
the 1
stairs 1
with 1
them 1
the 1
gardener 1
met 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
How 1
can 1
you 1
take 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
a 1
garland 1
of 1
such 1
common 1
flowers 1
Go 1
quickly 1
and 1
get 1
another 1
and 1
seek 1
out 1
the 1
prettiest 1
and 1
rarest 1
Oh 1
no 1
replied 1
the 1
boy 1
the 1
wild 1
ones 1
have 1
more 1
scent 1
and 1
will 1
please 1
her 1
better 1
When 1
he 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
said 1
Take 1
your 1
cap 1
off 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
seemly 1
to 1
keep 1
it 1
on 1
in 1
my 1
presence 1
He 1
again 1
said 1
I 1
may 1
not 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
sore 1
head 1
She 1
however 1
caught 1
at 1
his 1
cap 1
and 1
pulled 1
it 1
off 1
and 1
then 1
his 1
golden 1
hair 1
rolled 1
down 1
on 1
his 1
shoulders 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
splendid 1
to 1
behold 1
He 1
wanted 1
to 1
run 1
out 1
but 1
she 1
held 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
arm 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
ducats 1
With 1
these 1
he 1
departed 1
but 1
he 1
cared 1
nothing 1
for 1
the 1
gold 1
pieces 1
He 1
took 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
gardener 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
present 1
them 1
to 1
your 1
children 1
they 1
can 1
play 1
with 1
them 1
The 1
following 1
day 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
again 1
called 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
bring 1
her 1
a 1
wreath 1
of 1
field 1
flowers 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
in 1
with 1
it 1
she 1
instantly 1
snatched 1
at 1
his 1
cap 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
take 1
it 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
held 1
it 1
fast 1
with 1
both 1
hands 1
She 1
again 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
ducats 1
but 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
keep 1
them 1
and 1
gave 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
gardener 1
for 1
playthings 1
for 1
his 1
children 1
On 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
things 1
went 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
get 1
his 1
cap 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
her 1
money 1
Not 1
long 1
afterwards 1
the 1
country 1
was 1
overrun 1
by 1
war 1
The 1
king 1
gathered 1
together 1
his 1
people 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
whether 1
or 1
not 1
he 1
could 1
offer 1
any 1
opposition 1
to 1
the 1
enemy 1
who 1
was 1
superior 1
in 1
strength 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
mighty 1
army 1
Then 1
said 1
the 1
gardener 1
s 1
boy 1
I 1
am 1
grown 1
up 1
and 1
will 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
wars 1
also 1
only 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
horse 1
The 1
others 1
laughed 1
and 1
said 1
Seek 1
one 1
for 1
yourself 1
when 1
we 1
are 1
gone 1
we 1
will 1
leave 1
one 1
behind 1
us 1
in 1
the 1
stable 1
for 1
you 1
When 1
they 1
had 1
gone 1
forth 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
stable 1
and 1
led 1
the 1
horse 1
out 1
it 1
was 1
lame 1
of 1
one 1
foot 1
and 1
limped 1
hobblety 1
jib 1
hobblety 1
jib 1
nevertheless 1
he 1
mounted 1
it 1
and 1
rode 1
away 1
to 1
the 1
dark 1
forest 1
When 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
outskirts 1
he 1
called 1
Iron 1
Hans 1
three 1
times 1
so 1
loudly 1
that 1
it 1
echoed 1
through 1
the 1
trees 1
Thereupon 1
the 1
wild 1
man 1
appeared 1
immediately 1
and 1
said 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
desire 1
I 1
want 1
a 1
strong 1
steed 1
for 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
wars 1
That 1
you 1
shall 1
have 1
and 1
still 1
more 1
than 1
you 1
ask 1
for 1
Then 1
the 1
wild 1
man 1
went 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
a 1
stable 1
boy 1
came 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
who 1
led 1
a 1
horse 1
that 1
snorted 1
with 1
its 1
nostrils 1
and 1
could 1
hardly 1
be 1
restrained 1
and 1
behind 1
them 1
followed 1
a 1
great 1
troop 1
of 1
warriors 1
entirely 1
equipped 1
in 1
iron 1
and 1
their 1
swords 1
flashed 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
The 1
youth 1
made 1
over 1
his 1
three 1
legged 1
horse 1
to 1
the 1
stable 1
boy 1
mounted 1
the 1
other 1
and 1
rode 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
soldiers 1
When 1
he 1
got 1
near 1
the 1
battlefield 1
a 1
great 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
men 1
had 1
already 1
fallen 1
and 1
little 1
was 1
wanting 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
rest 1
give 1
way 1
Then 1
the 1
youth 1
galloped 1
thither 1
with 1
his 1
iron 1
soldiers 1
broke 1
like 1
a 1
hurricane 1
over 1
the 1
enemy 1
and 1
beat 1
down 1
all 1
who 1
opposed 1
him 1
They 1
began 1
to 1
flee 1
but 1
the 1
youth 1
pursued 1
and 1
never 1
stopped 1
until 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
single 1
man 1
left 1
Instead 1
of 1
returning 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
however 1
he 1
conducted 1
his 1
troop 1
by 1
byways 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
called 1
forth 1
Iron 1
Hans 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
desire 1
asked 1
the 1
wild 1
man 1
Take 1
back 1
your 1
horse 1
and 1
your 1
troops 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
my 1
three 1
legged 1
horse 1
again 1
All 1
that 1
he 1
asked 1
was 1
done 1
and 1
soon 1
he 1
was 1
riding 1
on 1
his 1
three 1
legged 1
horse 1
When 1
the 1
king 1
returned 1
to 1
his 1
palace 1
his 1
daughter 1
went 1
to 1
meet 1
him 1
and 1
wished 1
him 1
joy 1
of 1
his 1
victory 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
the 1
one 1
who 1
carried 1
away 1
the 1
victory 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
a 1
strange 1
knight 1
who 1
came 1
to 1
my 1
assistance 1
with 1
his 1
soldiers 1
The 1
daughter 1
wanted 1
to 1
hear 1
who 1
the 1
strange 1
knight 1
was 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
and 1
said 1
He 1
followed 1
the 1
enemy 1
and 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
see 1
him 1
again 1
She 1
inquired 1
of 1
the 1
gardener 1
where 1
his 1
boy 1
was 1
but 1
he 1
smiled 1
and 1
said 1
He 1
has 1
just 1
come 1
home 1
on 1
his 1
three 1
legged 1
horse 1
and 1
the 1
others 1
have 1
been 1
mocking 1
him 1
and 1
crying 1
Here 1
comes 1
our 1
hobblety 1
jib 1
back 1
again 1
They 1
asked 1
too 1
Under 1
what 1
hedge 1
have 1
you 1
been 1
lying 1
sleeping 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
So 1
he 1
said 1
I 1
did 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
all 1
and 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
gone 1
badly 1
without 1
me 1
And 1
then 1
he 1
was 1
still 1
more 1
ridiculed 1
The 1
king 1
said 1
to 1
his 1
daughter 1
I 1
will 1
proclaim 1
a 1
great 1
feast 1
that 1
shall 1
last 1
for 1
three 1
days 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
throw 1
a 1
golden 1
apple 1
Perhaps 1
the 1
unknown 1
man 1
will 1
show 1
himself 1
When 1
the 1
feast 1
was 1
announced 1
the 1
youth 1
went 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
called 1
Iron 1
Hans 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
desire 1
asked 1
he 1
That 1
I 1
may 1
catch 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
s 1
golden 1
apple 1
It 1
is 1
as 1
safe 1
as 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
it 1
already 1
said 1
Iron 1
Hans 1
You 1
shall 1
likewise 1
have 1
a 1
suit 1
of 1
red 1
armour 1
for 1
the 1
occasion 1
and 1
ride 1
on 1
a 1
spirited 1
chestnut 1
horse 1
When 1
the 1
day 1
came 1
the 1
youth 1
galloped 1
to 1
the 1
spot 1
took 1
his 1
place 1
amongst 1
the 1
knights 1
and 1
was 1
recognized 1
by 1
no 1
one 1
The 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
came 1
forward 1
and 1
threw 1
a 1
golden 1
apple 1
to 1
the 1
knights 1
but 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
caught 1
it 1
but 1
he 1
only 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
it 1
he 1
galloped 1
away 1
On 1
the 1
second 1
day 1
Iron 1
Hans 1
equipped 1
him 1
as 1
a 1
white 1
knight 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
white 1
horse 1
Again 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
who 1
caught 1
the 1
apple 1
and 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
linger 1
an 1
instant 1
but 1
galloped 1
off 1
with 1
it 1
The 1
king 1
grew 1
angry 1
and 1
said 1
That 1
is 1
not 1
allowed 1
he 1
must 1
appear 1
before 1
me 1
and 1
tell 1
his 1
name 1
He 1
gave 1
the 1
order 1
that 1
if 1
the 1
knight 1
who 1
caught 1
the 1
apple 1
should 1
go 1
away 1
again 1
they 1
should 1
pursue 1
him 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
come 1
back 1
willingly 1
they 1
were 1
to 1
cut 1
him 1
down 1
and 1
stab 1
him 1
On 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
he 1
received 1
from 1
Iron 1
Hans 1
a 1
suit 1
of 1
black 1
armour 1
and 1
a 1
black 1
horse 1
and 1
again 1
he 1
caught 1
the 1
apple 1
But 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
riding 1
off 1
with 1
it 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
attendants 1
pursued 1
him 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
got 1
so 1
near 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
wounded 1
the 1
youth 1
s 1
leg 1
with 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
his 1
sword 1
The 1
youth 1
nevertheless 1
escaped 1
from 1
them 1
but 1
his 1
horse 1
leapt 1
so 1
violently 1
that 1
the 1
helmet 1
fell 1
from 1
the 1
youth 1
s 1
head 1
and 1
they 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
golden 1
hair 1
They 1
rode 1
back 1
and 1
announced 1
this 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
The 1
following 1
day 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
asked 1
the 1
gardener 1
about 1
his 1
boy 1
He 1
is 1
at 1
work 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
the 1
queer 1
creature 1
has 1
been 1
at 1
the 1
festival 1
too 1
and 1
only 1
came 1
home 1
yesterday 1
evening 1
he 1
has 1
likewise 1
shown 1
my 1
children 1
three 1
golden 1
apples 1
which 1
he 1
has 1
won 1
The 1
king 1
had 1
him 1
summoned 1
into 1
his 1
presence 1
and 1
he 1
came 1
and 1
again 1
had 1
his 1
little 1
cap 1
on 1
his 1
head 1
But 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
took 1
it 1
off 1
and 1
then 1
his 1
golden 1
hair 1
fell 1
down 1
over 1
his 1
shoulders 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
handsome 1
that 1
all 1
were 1
amazed 1
Are 1
you 1
the 1
knight 1
who 1
came 1
every 1
day 1
to 1
the 1
festival 1
always 1
in 1
different 1
colours 1
and 1
who 1
caught 1
the 1
three 1
golden 1
apples 1
asked 1
the 1
king 1
Yes 1
answered 1
he 1
and 1
here 1
the 1
apples 1
are 1
and 1
he 1
took 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
returned 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
If 1
you 1
desire 1
further 1
proof 1
you 1
may 1
see 1
the 1
wound 1
which 1
your 1
people 1
gave 1
me 1
when 1
they 1
followed 1
me 1
But 1
I 1
am 1
likewise 1
the 1
knight 1
who 1
helped 1
you 1
to 1
your 1
victory 1
over 1
your 1
enemies 1
If 1
you 1
can 1
perform 1
such 1
deeds 1
as 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
no 1
gardener 1
s 1
boy 1
tell 1
me 1
who 1
is 1
your 1
father 1
My 1
father 1
is 1
a 1
mighty 1
king 1
and 1
gold 1
have 1
I 1
in 1
plenty 1
as 1
great 1
as 1
I 1
require 1
I 1
well 1
see 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
that 1
I 1
owe 1
my 1
thanks 1
to 1
you 1
can 1
I 1
do 1
anything 1
to 1
please 1
you 1
Yes 1
answered 1
he 1
that 1
indeed 1
you 1
can 1
Give 1
me 1
your 1
daughter 1
to 1
wife 1
The 1
maiden 1
laughed 1
and 1
said 1
He 1
does 1
not 1
stand 1
much 1
on 1
ceremony 1
but 1
I 1
have 1
already 1
seen 1
by 1
his 1
golden 1
hair 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
no 1
gardener 1
s 1
boy 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
went 1
and 1
kissed 1
him 1
His 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
wedding 1
and 1
were 1
in 1
great 1
delight 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
given 1
up 1
all 1
hope 1
of 1
ever 1
seeing 1
their 1
dear 1
son 1
again 1
And 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
sitting 1
at 1
the 1
marriage 1
feast 1
the 1
music 1
suddenly 1
stopped 1
the 1
doors 1
opened 1
and 1
a 1
stately 1
king 1
came 1
in 1
with 1
a 1
great 1
retinue 1
He 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
youth 1
embraced 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
am 1
Iron 1
Hans 1
and 1
was 1
by 1
enchantment 1
a 1
wild 1
man 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
all 1
the 1
treasures 1
which 1
I 1
possess 1
shall 1
be 1
your 1
property 1
CAT 1
SKIN 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
king 1
whose 1
queen 1
had 1
hair 1
of 1
the 1
purest 1
gold 1
and 1
was 1
so 1
beautiful 1
that 1
her 1
match 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
met 1
with 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
But 1
this 1
beautiful 1
queen 1
fell 1
ill 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
felt 1
that 1
her 1
end 1
drew 1
near 1
she 1
called 1
the 1
king 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
Promise 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
never 1
marry 1
again 1
unless 1
you 1
meet 1
with 1
a 1
wife 1
who 1
is 1
as 1
beautiful 1
as 1
I 1
am 1
and 1
who 1
has 1
golden 1
hair 1
like 1
mine 1
Then 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
in 1
his 1
grief 1
promised 1
all 1
she 1
asked 1
she 1
shut 1
her 1
eyes 1
and 1
died 1
But 1
the 1
king 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
comforted 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
never 1
thought 1
of 1
taking 1
another 1
wife 1
At 1
last 1
however 1
his 1
wise 1
men 1
said 1
this 1
will 1
not 1
do 1
the 1
king 1
must 1
marry 1
again 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
have 1
a 1
queen 1
So 1
messengers 1
were 1
sent 1
far 1
and 1
wide 1
to 1
seek 1
for 1
a 1
bride 1
as 1
beautiful 1
as 1
the 1
late 1
queen 1
But 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
princess 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
so 1
beautiful 1
and 1
if 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
still 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
one 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
who 1
had 1
golden 1
hair 1
So 1
the 1
messengers 1
came 1
home 1
and 1
had 2
all 1
their 1
trouble 1
for 1
nothing 1
Now 1
the 1
king 1
had 1
a 1
daughter 1
who 1
was 1
just 1
as 1
beautiful 1
as 1
her 1
mother 1
and 1
had 1
the 1
same 1
golden 1
hair 1
And 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
grown 1
up 1
the 1
king 1
looked 1
at 1
her 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
just 1
like 1
this 1
late 1
queen 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
his 1
courtiers 1
May 1
I 1
not 1
marry 1
my 1
daughter 1
She 1
is 1
the 1
very 1
image 1
of 1
my 1
dead 1
wife 1
unless 1
I 1
have 1
her 1
I 1
shall 1
not 1
find 1
any 1
bride 1
upon 1
the 1
whole 1
earth 1
and 1
you 1
say 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
queen 1
When 1
the 1
courtiers 1
heard 1
this 1
they 1
were 1
shocked 1
and 1
said 1
Heaven 1
forbid 1
that 1
a 1
father 1
should 1
marry 1
his 1
daughter 1
Out 1
of 1
so 1
great 1
a 1
sin 1
no 1
good 1
can 1
come 1
And 1
his 1
daughter 1
was 1
also 1
shocked 1
but 1
hoped 1
the 1
king 1
would 1
soon 1
give 1
up 1
such 1
thoughts 1
so 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
Before 1
I 1
marry 1
anyone 1
I 1
must 1
have 1
three 1
dresses 1
one 1
must 1
be 1
of 1
gold 1
like 1
the 1
sun 1
another 1
must 1
be 1
of 1
shining 1
silver 1
like 1
the 1
moon 1
and 1
a 1
third 1
must 1
be 1
dazzling 1
as 1
the 1
stars 1
besides 1
this 1
I 1
want 1
a 1
mantle 1
of 1
a 1
thousand 1
different 1
kinds 1
of 1
fur 1
put 1
together 1
to 1
which 1
every 1
beast 1
in 1
the 1
kingdom 1
must 1
give 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
skin 1
And 1
thus 1
she 1
thought 1
he 1
would 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
no 1
more 1
But 1
the 1
king 1
made 1
the 1
most 1
skilful 1
workmen 1
in 1
his 1
kingdom 1
weave 1
the 1
three 1
dresses 1
one 1
golden 1
like 1
the 1
sun 1
another 1
silvery 1
like 1
the 1
moon 1
and 1
a 1
third 1
sparkling 1
like 1
the 1
stars 1
and 1
his 1
hunters 1
were 1
told 1
to 1
hunt 1
out 1
all 1
the 1
beasts 1
in 1
his 1
kingdom 1
and 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
finest 1
fur 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
skins 1
and 1
thus 1
a 1
mantle 1
of 1
a 1
thousand 1
furs 1
was 1
made 1
When 1
all 1
were 1
ready 1
the 1
king 1
sent 1
them 1
to 1
her 1
but 1
she 1
got 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
when 1
all 1
were 1
asleep 1
and 1
took 1
three 1
of 1
her 1
trinkets 1
a 1
golden 1
ring 1
a 1
golden 1
necklace 1
and 1
a 1
golden 1
brooch 1
and 1
packed 1
the 1
three 1
dresses 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
the 1
moon 1
and 1
the 1
stars 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
nutshell 1
and 1
wrapped 1
herself 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
mantle 1
made 1
of 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
fur 1
and 1
besmeared 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
hands 1
with 1
soot 1
Then 1
she 1
threw 1
herself 1
upon 1
Heaven 1
for 1
help 1
in 1
her 1
need 1
and 1
went 1
away 1
and 1
journeyed 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
night 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
large 1
wood 1
As 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
tired 1
she 1
sat 1
herself 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
hollow 1
of 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
soon 1
fell 1
asleep 1
and 1
there 1
she 1
slept 1
on 1
till 1
it 1
was 1
midday 1
Now 1
as 1
the 1
king 1
to 1
whom 1
the 1
wood 1
belonged 1
was 1
hunting 1
in 1
it 1
his 1
dogs 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
snuff 1
about 1
and 1
run 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
and 1
bark 1
Look 1
sharp 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
to 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
and 1
see 1
what 1
sort 1
of 1
game 1
lies 1
there 1
And 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
back 1
again 1
said 1
In 1
the 1
hollow 1
tree 1
there 1
lies 1
a 1
most 1
wonderful 1
beast 1
such 1
as 1
we 1
never 1
saw 1
before 1
its 1
skin 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
of 1
a 1
thousand 1
kinds 1
of 1
fur 1
but 1
there 1
it 1
lies 1
fast 1
asleep 1
See 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
catch 1
it 1
alive 1
and 1
we 1
will 1
take 1
it 1
with 1
us 1
So 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
the 1
maiden 1
awoke 1
and 1
was 1
greatly 1
frightened 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
poor 1
child 1
that 1
has 1
neither 1
father 1
nor 1
mother 1
left 1
have 1
pity 1
on 1
me 1
and 1
take 1
me 1
with 1
you 1
Then 1
they 1
said 1
Yes 1
Miss 1
Cat 1
skin 1
you 1
will 1
do 1
for 1
the 1
kitchen 1
you 1
can 1
sweep 1
up 1
the 1
ashes 1
and 1
do 1
things 1
of 1
that 1
sort 1
So 1
they 1
put 1
her 1
into 1
the 1
coach 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
home 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
palace 1
Then 1
they 1
showed 1
her 1
a 1
little 1
corner 1
under 1
the 1
staircase 1
where 1
no 1
light 1
of 1
day 1
ever 1
peeped 1
in 1
and 1
said 1
Cat 1
skin 1
you 1
may 1
lie 1
and 1
sleep 1
there 1
And 1
she 1
was 1
sent 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
made 1
to 1
fetch 1
wood 1
and 1
water 1
to 1
blow 1
the 1
fire 1
pluck 1
the 1
poultry 1
pick 1
the 1
herbs 1
sift 1
the 1
ashes 1
and 1
do 1
all 1
the 1
dirty 1
work 1
Thus 1
Cat 1
skin 1
lived 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
very 1
sorrowfully 1
Ah 1
pretty 1
princess 1
thought 1
she 1
what 1
will 1
now 1
become 1
of 1
thee 1
But 1
it 1
happened 1
one 1
day 1
that 1
a 1
feast 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
held 1
in 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
castle 1
so 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
cook 1
May 1
I 1
go 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
and 1
see 1
what 1
is 1
going 1
on 1
I 1
will 1
take 1
care 1
and 1
stand 1
behind 1
the 1
door 1
And 1
the 1
cook 1
said 1
Yes 1
you 1
may 1
go 1
but 1
be 1
back 1
again 1
in 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
s 1
time 1
to 1
rake 1
out 1
the 1
ashes 1
Then 1
she 1
took 1
her 1
little 1
lamp 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
her 1
cabin 1
and 1
took 1
off 1
the 1
fur 1
skin 1
and 1
washed 1
the 1
soot 1
from 1
off 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
hands 1
so 1
that 1
her 1
beauty 1
shone 1
forth 1
like 1
the 1
sun 1
from 1
behind 1
the 1
clouds 1
She 1
next 1
opened 1
her 1
nutshell 1
and 1
brought 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
the 1
dress 1
that 1
shone 1
like 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
so 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
feast 1
Everyone 1
made 1
way 1
for 1
her 1
for 1
nobody 1
knew 1
her 1
and 1
they 1
thought 1
she 1
could 1
be 1
no 1
less 1
than 1
a 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
But 1
the 1
king 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
held 1
out 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
danced 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
he 1
thought 1
in 1
his 1
heart 1
I 1
never 1
saw 1
any 1
one 1
half 1
so 1
beautiful 1
When 1
the 1
dance 1
was 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
she 1
curtsied 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
looked 1
round 1
for 1
her 1
she 1
was 1
gone 1
no 1
one 1
knew 1
wither 1
The 1
guards 1
that 1
stood 1
at 1
the 1
castle 1
gate 1
were 1
called 1
in 1
but 1
they 1
had 1
seen 1
no 1
one 1
The 1
truth 1
was 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
run 1
into 1
her 1
little 1
cabin 1
pulled 1
off 1
her 1
dress 1
blackened 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
hands 1
put 1
on 1
the 1
fur 1
skin 1
cloak 1
and 1
was 1
Cat 1
skin 1
again 1
When 1
she 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
to 1
her 1
work 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
rake 1
the 1
ashes 1
the 1
cook 1
said 1
Let 1
that 1
alone 1
till 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
heat 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
soup 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
run 1
up 1
now 1
and 1
give 1
a 1
peep 1
but 1
take 1
care 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
let 1
a 1
hair 1
fall 1
into 1
it 1
or 1
you 1
will 1
run 1
a 1
chance 1
of 1
never 1
eating 1
again 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
cook 1
went 1
away 1
Cat 1
skin 1
heated 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
soup 1
and 1
toasted 1
a 1
slice 1
of 1
bread 1
first 1
as 1
nicely 1
as 1
ever 1
she 1
could 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
ready 1
she 1
went 1
and 1
looked 1
in 1
the 1
cabin 1
for 1
her 1
little 1
golden 1
ring 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
dish 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
soup 1
was 1
When 1
the 1
dance 1
was 1
over 1
the 1
king 1
ordered 1
his 1
soup 1
to 1
be 1
brought 1
in 1
and 1
it 1
pleased 1
him 1
so 1
well 1
that 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
tasted 1
any 1
so 1
good 1
before 1
At 1
the 1
bottom 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
gold 1
ring 1
lying 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
make 1
out 1
how 1
it 1
had 1
got 1
there 1
he 1
ordered 1
the 1
cook 1
to 1
be 1
sent 1
for 1
The 1
cook 1
was 1
frightened 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
order 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
Cat 1
skin 1
You 1
must 1
have 1
let 1
a 1
hair 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
soup 1
if 1
it 1
be 1
so 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
a 1
good 1
beating 1
Then 1
he 1
went 1
before 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
he 1
asked 1
him 1
who 1
had 1
cooked 1
the 1
soup 1
I 1
did 1
answered 1
the 1
cook 1
But 1
the 1
king 1
said 1
That 1
is 1
not 1
true 1
it 1
was 1
better 1
done 1
than 1
you 1
could 1
do 1
it 1
Then 1
he 1
answered 1
To 1
tell 1
the 1
truth 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
cook 1
it 1
but 1
Cat 1
skin 1
did 1
Then 1
let 1
Cat 1
skin 1
come 1
up 1
said 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
came 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
Who 1
are 1
you 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
poor 1
child 1
said 1
she 1
that 1
has 1
lost 1
both 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
How 1
came 1
you 1
in 1
my 1
palace 1
asked 1
he 1
I 1
am 1
good 1
for 1
nothing 1
said 1
she 1
but 1
to 1
be 1
scullion 1
girl 1
and 1
to 1
have 1
boots 1
and 1
shoes 1
thrown 1
at 1
my 1
head 1
But 1
how 1
did 1
you 1
get 1
the 1
ring 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
soup 1
asked 1
the 1
king 1
Then 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
own 1
that 1
she 1
knew 1
anything 1
about 1
the 1
ring 1
so 1
the 1
king 1
sent 1
her 1
away 1
again 1
about 1
her 1
business 1
After 1
a 1
time 1
there 1
was 1
another 1
feast 1
and 1
Cat 1
skin 1
asked 1
the 1
cook 1
to 1
let 1
her 1
go 1
up 1
and 1
see 1
it 1
as 1
before 1
Yes 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
come 1
again 1
in 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
and 1
cook 1
the 1
king 1
the 1
soup 1
that 1
he 1
likes 1
so 1
much 1
Then 1
she 1
ran 1
to 1
her 1
little 1
cabin 1
washed 1
herself 1
quickly 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
dress 1
out 1
which 1
was 1
silvery 1
as 1
the 1
moon 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
on 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
went 1
in 1
looking 1
like 1
a 1
king 1
s 1
daughter 1
the 1
king 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
rejoiced 1
at 1
seeing 1
her 1
again 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
dance 1
began 1
he 1
danced 1
with 1
her 1
After 1
the 1
dance 1
was 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
she 1
managed 1
to 1
slip 1
out 1
so 1
slyly 1
that 1
the 1
king 1
did 1
not 1
see 1
where 1
she 1
was 1
gone 1
but 1
she 1
sprang 1
into 1
her 1
little 1
cabin 1
and 1
made 1
herself 1
into 1
Cat 1
skin 1
again 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
to 1
cook 1
the 1
soup 1
Whilst 1
the 1
cook 1
was 1
above 1
stairs 1
she 1
got 1
the 1
golden 1
necklace 1
and 1
dropped 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
soup 1
then 1
it 1
was 1
brought 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
who 1
ate 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
pleased 1
him 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
before 1
so 1
he 1
sent 1
for 1
the 1
cook 1
who 1
was 1
again 1
forced 1
to 1
tell 1
him 1
that 1
Cat 1
skin 1
had 1
cooked 1
it 1
Cat 1
skin 1
was 1
brought 1
again 1
before 1
the 1
king 1
but 1
she 1
still 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
only 1
fit 1
to 1
have 1
boots 1
and 1
shoes 1
thrown 1
at 1
her 1
head 1
But 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
had 1
ordered 1
a 1
feast 1
to 1
be 1
got 1
ready 1
for 1
the 1
third 1
time 1
it 1
happened 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
before 1
You 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
witch 1
Cat 1
skin 1
said 1
the 1
cook 1
for 1
you 1
always 1
put 1
something 1
into 1
your 1
soup 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
pleases 1
the 1
king 1
better 1
than 1
mine 1
However 1
he 1
let 1
her 1
go 1
up 1
as 1
before 1
Then 1
she 1
put 1
on 1
her 1
dress 1
which 1
sparkled 1
like 1
the 1
stars 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
ball 1
room 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
danced 1
with 1
her 1
again 1
and 1
thought 1
she 1
had 1
never 1
looked 1
so 1
beautiful 1
as 1
she 1
did 1
then 1
So 1
whilst 1
he 1
was 1
dancing 1
with 1
her 1
he 1
put 1
a 1
gold 1
ring 1
on 1
her 1
finger 1
without 1
her 1
seeing 1
it 1
and 1
ordered 1
that 1
the 1
dance 1
should 1
be 1
kept 1
up 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
When 1
it 1
was 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
held 1
her 1
fast 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
but 1
she 1
slipped 1
away 1
and 1
sprang 1
so 1
quickly 1
through 1
the 1
crowd 1
that 1
he 1
lost 1
sight 1
of 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
ran 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
she 1
could 1
into 1
her 1
little 1
cabin 1
under 1
the 1
stairs 1
But 1
this 1
time 1
she 1
kept 1
away 1
too 1
long 1
and 1
stayed 1
beyond 1
the 1
half 1
hour 1
so 1
she 1
had 1
not 1
time 1
to 1
take 1
off 1
her 1
fine 1
dress 1
and 1
threw 1
her 1
fur 1
mantle 1
over 1
it 1
and 1
in 1
her 1
haste 1
did 1
not 1
blacken 1
herself 1
all 1
over 1
with 1
soot 1
but 1
left 1
one 1
of 1
her 1
fingers 1
white 1
Then 1
she 1
ran 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
cooked 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
soup 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
cook 1
was 1
gone 1
she 1
put 1
the 1
golden 1
brooch 1
into 1
the 1
dish 1
When 1
the 1
king 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
he 1
ordered 1
Cat 1
skin 1
to 1
be 1
called 1
once 1
more 1
and 1
soon 1
saw 1
the 1
white 1
finger 1
and 1
the 1
ring 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
put 1
on 1
it 1
whilst 1
they 1
were 1
dancing 1
so 1
he 1
seized 1
her 1
hand 1
and 1
kept 1
fast 1
hold 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
wanted 1
to 1
loose 1
herself 1
and 1
spring 1
away 1
the 1
fur 1
cloak 1
fell 1
off 1
a 1
little 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
the 1
starry 1
dress 1
sparkled 1
underneath 1
it 1
Then 1
he 1
got 1
hold 1
of 1
the 1
fur 1
and 1
tore 1
it 1
off 1
and 1
her 1
golden 1
hair 1
and 1
beautiful 1
form 1
were 1
seen 1
and 1
she 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
hide 1
herself 1
so 1
she 1
washed 1
the 1
soot 1
and 1
ashes 1
from 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
showed 1
herself 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
princess 1
upon 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
But 1
the 1
king 1
said 1
You 1
are 1
my 1
beloved 1
bride 1
and 1
we 1
will 1
never 1
more 1
be 1
parted 1
from 1
each 1
other 1
And 1
the 1
wedding 1
feast 1
was 1
held 1
and 1
a 1
merry 1
day 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
ever 1
was 1
heard 1
of 1
or 1
seen 1
in 1
that 1
country 1
or 1
indeed 1
in 1
any 1
other 1
SNOW 1
WHITE 1
AND 1
ROSE 1
RED 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
poor 1
widow 1
who 1
lived 1
in 1
a 1
lonely 1
cottage 1
In 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
cottage 1
was 1
a 1
garden 1
wherein 1
stood 1
two 1
rose 1
trees 1
one 1
of 1
which 1
bore 1
white 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
red 1
roses 1
She 1
had 1
two 1
children 1
who 1
were 1
like 1
the 1
two 1
rose 1
trees 1
and 1
one 1
was 1
called 1
Snow 1
white 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
Rose 1
red 1
They 1
were 1
as 1
good 1
and 1
happy 1
as 1
busy 1
and 1
cheerful 1
as 1
ever 1
two 1
children 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
were 1
only 1
Snow 1
white 1
was 1
more 1
quiet 1
and 1
gentle 1
than 1
Rose 1
red 1
Rose 1
red 1
liked 1
better 1
to 1
run 1
about 1
in 1
the 1
meadows 1
and 1
fields 1
seeking 1
flowers 1
and 1
catching 1
butterflies 1
but 1
Snow 1
white 1
sat 1
at 1
home 1
with 1
her 1
mother 1
and 1
helped 1
her 1
with 1
her 1
housework 1
or 1
read 1
to 1
her 1
when 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
The 1
two 1
children 1
were 1
so 1
fond 1
of 1
one 1
another 1
that 1
they 1
always 1
held 1
each 1
other 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
when 1
they 1
went 1
out 1
together 1
and 1
when 1
Snow 1
white 1
said 1
We 1
will 1
not 1
leave 1
each 1
other 1
Rose 1
red 1
answered 1
Never 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
we 1
live 1
and 1
their 1
mother 1
would 1
add 1
What 1
one 1
has 1
she 1
must 1
share 1
with 1
the 1
other 1
They 1
often 1
ran 1
about 1
the 1
forest 1
alone 1
and 1
gathered 1
red 1
berries 1
and 1
no 1
beasts 1
did 1
them 1
any 1
harm 1
but 1
came 1
close 1
to 1
them 1
trustfully 1
The 1
little 1
hare 1
would 1
eat 1
a 1
cabbage 1
leaf 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
hands 1
the 1
roe 1
grazed 1
by 1
their 1
side 1
the 1
stag 1
leapt 1
merrily 1
by 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
birds 1
sat 1
still 1
upon 1
the 1
boughs 1
and 1
sang 1
whatever 1
they 1
knew 1
No 1
mishap 1
overtook 1
them 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
stayed 1
too 1
late 1
in 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
night 1
came 1
on 1
they 1
laid 1
themselves 1
down 1
near 1
one 1
another 1
upon 1
the 1
moss 1
and 1
slept 1
until 1
morning 1
came 1
and 1
their 1
mother 1
knew 1
this 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
worry 1
on 1
their 1
account 1
Once 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
spent 1
the 1
night 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
and 1
the 1
dawn 1
had 1
roused 1
them 1
they 1
saw 1
a 1
beautiful 1
child 1
in 1
a 1
shining 1
white 1
dress 1
sitting 1
near 1
their 1
bed 1
He 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
looked 1
quite 1
kindly 1
at 1
them 1
but 1
said 1
nothing 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
And 1
when 1
they 1
looked 1
round 1
they 1
found 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
sleeping 1
quite 1
close 1
to 1
a 1
precipice 1
and 1
would 1
certainly 1
have 1
fallen 1
into 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
gone 1
only 1
a 1
few 1
paces 1
further 1
And 1
their 1
mother 1
told 1
them 1
that 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
angel 1
who 1
watches 1
over 1
good 1
children 1
Snow 1
white 1
and 1
Rose 1
red 1
kept 1
their 1
mother 1
s 1
little 1
cottage 1
so 1
neat 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
pleasure 1
to 1
look 1
inside 1
it 1
In 1
the 1
summer 1
Rose 1
red 1
took 1
care 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
every 1
morning 1
laid 1
a 1
wreath 1
of 1
flowers 1
by 1
her 1
mother 1
s 1
bed 1
before 1
she 1
awoke 1
in 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
rose 1
from 1
each 1
tree 1
In 1
the 1
winter 1
Snow 1
white 1
lit 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
hung 1
the 1
kettle 1
on 1
the 1
hob 1
The 1
kettle 1
was 1
of 1
brass 1
and 1
shone 1
like 1
gold 1
so 1
brightly 1
was 1
it 1
polished 1
In 1
the 1
evening 1
when 1
the 1
snowflakes 1
fell 1
the 1
mother 1
said 1
Go 1
Snow 1
white 1
and 1
bolt 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
sat 1
round 1
the 1
hearth 1
and 1
the 1
mother 1
took 1
her 1
spectacles 1
and 1
read 1
aloud 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
large 1
book 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
girls 1
listened 1
as 1
they 1
sat 1
and 1
spun 1
And 1
close 1
by 1
them 1
lay 1
a 1
lamb 1
upon 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
behind 1
them 1
upon 1
a 1
perch 1
sat 1
a 1
white 1
dove 1
with 1
its 1
head 1
hidden 1
beneath 1
its 1
wings 1
One 1
evening 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
thus 1
sitting 1
comfortably 1
together 1
someone 1
knocked 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
wished 1
to 1
be 1
let 1
in 1
The 1
mother 1
said 1
Quick 1
Rose 1
red 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
traveller 1
who 1
is 1
seeking 1
shelter 1
Rose 1
red 1
went 1
and 1
pushed 1
back 1
the 1
bolt 1
thinking 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
poor 1
man 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
bear 1
that 1
stretched 1
his 1
broad 1
black 1
head 1
within 1
the 1
door 1
Rose 1
red 1
screamed 1
and 1
sprang 1
back 1
the 1
lamb 1
bleated 1
the 1
dove 1
fluttered 1
and 1
Snow 1
white 1
hid 1
herself 1
behind 1
her 1
mother 1
s 1
bed 1
But 1
the 1
bear 1
began 1
to 1
speak 1
and 1
said 1
Do 1
not 1
be 1
afraid 1
I 1
will 1
do 1
you 1
no 1
harm 1
I 1
am 1
half 1
frozen 1
and 1
only 1
want 1
to 1
warm 1
myself 1
a 1
little 1
beside 1
you 1
Poor 1
bear 1
said 1
the 1
mother 1
lie 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
only 1
take 1
care 1
that 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
burn 1
your 1
coat 1
Then 1
she 1
cried 1
Snow 1
white 1
Rose 1
red 1
come 1
out 1
the 1
bear 1
will 1
do 1
you 1
no 1
harm 1
he 1
means 1
well 1
So 1
they 1
both 1
came 1
out 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
lamb 1
and 1
dove 1
came 1
nearer 1
and 1
were 1
not 1
afraid 1
of 1
him 1
The 1
bear 1
said 1
Here 1
children 1
knock 1
the 1
snow 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
coat 1
a 1
little 1
so 1
they 1
brought 1
the 1
broom 1
and 1
swept 1
the 1
bear 1
s 1
hide 1
clean 1
and 1
he 1
stretched 1
himself 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
growled 1
contentedly 1
and 1
comfortably 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
they 1
grew 1
quite 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
played 1
tricks 1
with 1
their 1
clumsy 1
guest 1
They 1
tugged 1
his 1
hair 1
with 1
their 1
hands 1
put 1
their 1
feet 1
upon 1
his 1
back 1
and 1
rolled 1
him 1
about 1
or 1
they 1
took 1
a 1
hazel 1
switch 1
and 1
beat 1
him 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
growled 1
they 1
laughed 1
But 1
the 1
bear 1
took 1
it 1
all 1
in 1
good 1
part 1
only 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
too 1
rough 1
he 1
called 1
out 1
Leave 1
me 1
alive 1
children 1
Snow 1
white 1
Rose 1
red 1
Will 1
you 1
beat 1
your 1
wooer 1
dead 1
When 1
it 1
was 1
bed 1
time 1
and 1
the 1
others 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
the 1
mother 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
bear 1
You 1
can 1
lie 1
there 1
by 1
the 1
hearth 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
safe 1
from 1
the 1
cold 1
and 1
the 1
bad 1
weather 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
day 1
dawned 1
the 1
two 1
children 1
let 1
him 1
out 1
and 1
he 1
trotted 1
across 1
the 1
snow 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
Henceforth 1
the 1
bear 1
came 1
every 1
evening 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
hearth 1
and 1
let 1
the 1
children 1
amuse 1
themselves 1
with 1
him 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
they 1
liked 1
and 1
they 1
got 1
so 1
used 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
doors 1
were 1
never 1
fastened 1
until 1
their 1
black 1
friend 1
had 1
arrived 1
When 1
spring 1
had 1
come 1
and 1
all 1
outside 1
was 1
green 1
the 1
bear 1
said 1
one 1
morning 1
to 1
Snow 1
white 1
Now 1
I 1
must 1
go 1
away 1
and 1
cannot 1
come 1
back 1
for 1
the 1
whole 1
summer 1
Where 1
are 1
you 1
going 1
then 1
dear 1
bear 1
asked 1
Snow 1
white 1
I 1
must 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
guard 1
my 1
treasures 1
from 1
the 1
wicked 1
dwarfs 1
In 1
the 1
winter 1
when 1
the 1
earth 1
is 1
frozen 1
hard 1
they 1
are 1
obliged 1
to 1
stay 1
below 1
and 1
cannot 1
work 1
their 1
way 1
through 1
but 1
now 1
when 1
the 1
sun 1
has 1
thawed 1
and 1
warmed 1
the 1
earth 1
they 1
break 1
through 1
it 1
and 1
come 1
out 1
to 1
pry 1
and 1
steal 1
and 1
what 1
once 1
gets 1
into 1
their 1
hands 1
and 1
in 1
their 1
caves 1
does 1
not 1
easily 1
see 1
daylight 1
again 1
Snow 1
white 1
was 1
quite 1
sorry 1
at 1
his 1
departure 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
unbolted 1
the 1
door 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
bear 1
was 1
hurrying 1
out 1
he 1
caught 1
against 1
the 1
bolt 1
and 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
his 1
hairy 1
coat 1
was 1
torn 1
off 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
Snow 1
white 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
seen 1
gold 1
shining 1
through 1
it 1
but 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
sure 1
about 1
it 1
The 1
bear 1
ran 1
away 1
quickly 1
and 1
was 1
soon 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
behind 1
the 1
trees 1
A 1
short 1
time 1
afterwards 1
the 1
mother 1
sent 1
her 1
children 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
to 1
get 1
firewood 1
There 1
they 1
found 1
a 1
big 1
tree 1
which 1
lay 1
felled 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
close 1
by 1
the 1
trunk 1
something 1
was 1
jumping 1
backwards 1
and 1
forwards 1
in 1
the 1
grass 1
but 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
make 1
out 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
When 1
they 1
came 1
nearer 1
they 1
saw 1
a 1
dwarf 1
with 1
an 1
old 1
withered 1
face 1
and 1
a 1
snow 1
white 1
beard 1
a 1
yard 1
long 1
The 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
beard 1
was 1
caught 1
in 1
a 1
crevice 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
fellow 1
was 1
jumping 1
about 1
like 1
a 1
dog 1
tied 1
to 1
a 1
rope 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
He 1
glared 1
at 1
the 1
girls 1
with 1
his 1
fiery 1
red 1
eyes 1
and 1
cried 1
Why 1
do 1
you 1
stand 1
there 1
Can 1
you 1
not 1
come 1
here 1
and 1
help 1
me 1
What 1
are 1
you 1
up 1
to 1
little 1
man 1
asked 1
Rose 1
red 1
You 1
stupid 1
prying 1
goose 1
answered 1
the 1
dwarf 1
I 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
split 1
the 1
tree 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
little 1
wood 1
for 1
cooking 1
The 1
little 1
bit 1
of 1
food 1
that 1
we 1
people 1
get 1
is 1
immediately 1
burnt 1
up 1
with 1
heavy 1
logs 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
swallow 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
you 1
coarse 1
greedy 1
folk 1
I 1
had 1
just 1
driven 1
the 1
wedge 1
safely 1
in 1
and 1
everything 1
was 1
going 1
as 1
I 1
wished 1
but 1
the 1
cursed 1
wedge 1
was 1
too 1
smooth 1
and 1
suddenly 1
sprang 1
out 1
and 1
the 1
tree 1
closed 1
so 1
quickly 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
pull 1
out 1
my 1
beautiful 1
white 1
beard 1
so 1
now 1
it 1
is 1
tight 1
and 1
I 1
cannot 1
get 1
away 1
and 1
the 1
silly 1
sleek 1
milk 1
faced 1
things 1
laugh 1
Ugh 1
how 1
odious 1
you 1
are 1
The 1
children 1
tried 1
very 1
hard 1
but 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
pull 1
the 1
beard 1
out 1
it 1
was 1
caught 1
too 1
fast 1
I 1
will 1
run 1
and 1
fetch 1
someone 1
said 1
Rose 1
red 1
You 1
senseless 1
goose 1
snarled 1
the 1
dwarf 1
why 1
should 1
you 1
fetch 1
someone 1
You 1
are 1
already 1
two 1
too 1
many 1
for 1
me 1
can 1
you 1
not 1
think 1
of 1
something 1
better 1
Don 1
t 1
be 1
impatient 1
said 1
Snow 1
white 1
I 1
will 1
help 1
you 1
and 1
she 1
pulled 1
her 1
scissors 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
pocket 1
and 1
cut 1
off 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
beard 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
dwarf 1
felt 1
himself 1
free 1
he 1
laid 1
hold 1
of 1
a 1
bag 1
which 1
lay 1
amongst 1
the 1
roots 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
which 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
lifted 1
it 1
up 1
grumbling 1
to 1
himself 1
Uncouth 1
people 1
to 1
cut 1
off 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
my 1
fine 1
beard 1
Bad 1
luck 1
to 1
you 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
swung 1
the 1
bag 1
upon 1
his 1
back 1
and 1
went 1
off 1
without 1
even 1
once 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
children 1
Some 1
time 1
afterwards 1
Snow 1
white 1
and 1
Rose 1
red 1
went 1
to 1
catch 1
a 1
dish 1
of 1
fish 1
As 1
they 1
came 1
near 1
the 1
brook 1
they 1
saw 1
something 1
like 1
a 1
large 1
grasshopper 1
jumping 1
towards 1
the 1
water 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
leap 1
in 1
They 1
ran 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
found 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
dwarf 1
Where 1
are 1
you 1
going 1
said 1
Rose 1
red 1
you 1
surely 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
such 1
a 1
fool 1
cried 1
the 1
dwarf 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
accursed 1
fish 1
wants 1
to 1
pull 1
me 1
in 1
The 1
little 1
man 1
had 1
been 1
sitting 1
there 1
fishing 1
and 1
unluckily 1
the 1
wind 1
had 1
tangled 1
up 1
his 1
beard 1
with 1
the 1
fishing 1
line 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
a 1
big 1
fish 1
made 1
a 1
bite 1
and 1
the 1
feeble 1
creature 1
had 1
not 1
strength 1
to 1
pull 1
it 1
out 1
the 1
fish 1
kept 1
the 1
upper 1
hand 1
and 1
pulled 1
the 1
dwarf 1
towards 1
him 1
He 1
held 1
on 1
to 1
all 1
the 1
reeds 1
and 1
rushes 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
of 1
little 1
good 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
follow 1
the 1
movements 1
of 1
the 1
fish 1
and 1
was 1
in 1
urgent 1
danger 1
of 1
being 1
dragged 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
The 1
girls 1
came 1
just 1
in 1
time 1
they 1
held 1
him 1
fast 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
free 1
his 1
beard 1
from 1
the 1
line 1
but 1
all 1
in 1
vain 1
beard 1
and 1
line 1
were 1
entangled 1
fast 1
together 1
There 1
was 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
to 1
bring 1
out 1
the 1
scissors 1
and 1
cut 1
the 1
beard 1
whereby 1
a 1
small 1
part 1
of 1
it 1
was 1
lost 1
When 1
the 1
dwarf 1
saw 1
that 1
he 1
screamed 1
out 1
Is 1
that 1
civil 1
you 1
toadstool 1
to 1
disfigure 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
face 1
Was 1
it 1
not 1
enough 1
to 1
clip 1
off 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
my 1
beard 1
Now 1
you 1
have 1
cut 1
off 1
the 1
best 1
part 1
of 1
it 1
I 1
cannot 1
let 1
myself 1
be 1
seen 1
by 1
my 1
people 1
I 1
wish 1
you 1
had 1
been 1
made 1
to 1
run 1
the 1
soles 1
off 1
your 1
shoes 1
Then 1
he 1
took 1
out 1
a 1
sack 1
of 1
pearls 1
which 1
lay 1
in 1
the 1
rushes 1
and 1
without 1
another 1
word 1
he 1
dragged 1
it 1
away 1
and 1
disappeared 1
behind 1
a 1
stone 1
It 1
happened 1
that 1
soon 1
afterwards 1
the 1
mother 1
sent 1
the 1
two 1
children 1
to 1
the 1
town 1
to 1
buy 1
needles 1
and 1
thread 1
and 1
laces 1
and 1
ribbons 1
The 1
road 1
led 1
them 1
across 1
a 1
heath 1
upon 1
which 1
huge 1
pieces 1
of 1
rock 1
lay 1
strewn 1
about 1
There 1
they 1
noticed 1
a 1
large 1
bird 1
hovering 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
flying 1
slowly 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
above 1
them 1
it 1
sank 1
lower 1
and 1
lower 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
settled 1
near 1
a 1
rock 1
not 1
far 1
away 1
Immediately 1
they 1
heard 1
a 1
loud 1
piteous 1
cry 1
They 1
ran 1
up 1
and 1
saw 1
with 1
horror 1
that 1
the 1
eagle 1
had 1
seized 1
their 1
old 1
acquaintance 1
the 1
dwarf 1
and 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
carry 1
him 1
off 1
The 1
children 1
full 1
of 1
pity 1
at 1
once 1
took 1
tight 1
hold 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
and 1
pulled 1
against 1
the 1
eagle 1
so 1
long 1
that 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
let 1
his 1
booty 1
go 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
dwarf 1
had 1
recovered 1
from 1
his 1
first 1
fright 1
he 1
cried 1
with 1
his 1
shrill 1
voice 1
Could 1
you 1
not 1
have 1
done 1
it 1
more 1
carefully 1
You 1
dragged 1
at 1
my 1
brown 1
coat 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
torn 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
holes 1
you 1
clumsy 1
creatures 1
Then 1
he 1
took 1
up 1
a 1
sack 1
full 1
of 1
precious 1
stones 1
and 1
slipped 1
away 1
again 1
under 1
the 1
rock 1
into 1
his 1
hole 1
The 1
girls 1
who 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
were 1
used 1
to 1
his 1
ingratitude 1
went 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
and 1
did 1
their 1
business 1
in 1
town 1
As 1
they 1
crossed 1
the 1
heath 1
again 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
home 1
they 1
surprised 1
the 1
dwarf 1
who 1
had 1
emptied 1
out 1
his 1
bag 1
of 1
precious 1
stones 1
in 1
a 1
clean 1
spot 1
and 1
had 1
not 1
thought 1
that 1
anyone 1
would 1
come 1
there 1
so 1
late 1
The 1
evening 1
sun 1
shone 1
upon 1
the 1
brilliant 1
stones 1
they 1
glittered 1
and 1
sparkled 1
with 1
all 1
colours 1
so 1
beautifully 1
that 1
the 1
children 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
stared 1
at 1
them 1
Why 1
do 1
you 1
stand 1
gaping 1
there 1
cried 1
the 1
dwarf 1
and 1
his 1
ashen 1
grey 1
face 1
became 1
copper 1
red 1
with 1
rage 1
He 1
was 1
still 1
cursing 1
when 1
a 1
loud 1
growling 1
was 1
heard 1
and 1
a 1
black 1
bear 1
came 1
trotting 1
towards 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
The 1
dwarf 1
sprang 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
fright 1
but 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
reach 1
his 1
cave 1
for 1
the 1
bear 1
was 1
already 1
close 1
Then 1
in 1
the 1
dread 1
of 1
his 1
heart 1
he 1
cried 1
Dear 1
Mr 1
Bear 1
spare 1
me 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
all 1
my 1
treasures 1
look 1
the 1
beautiful 1
jewels 1
lying 1
there 1
Grant 1
me 1
my 1
life 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
slender 1
little 1
fellow 1
as 1
I 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
feel 1
me 1
between 1
your 1
teeth 1
Come 1
take 1
these 1
two 1
wicked 1
girls 1
they 1
are 1
tender 1
morsels 1
for 1
you 1
fat 1
as 1
young 1
quails 1
for 1
mercy 1
s 1
sake 1
eat 1
them 1
The 1
bear 1
took 1
no 1
heed 1
of 1
his 1
words 1
but 1
gave 1
the 1
wicked 1
creature 1
a 1
single 1
blow 1
with 1
his 1
paw 1
and 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
move 1
again 1
The 1
girls 1
had 1
run 1
away 1
but 1
the 1
bear 1
called 1
to 1
them 1
Snow 1
white 1
and 1
Rose 1
red 1
do 1
not 1
be 1
afraid 1
wait 1
I 1
will 1
come 1
with 1
you 1
Then 1
they 1
recognized 1
his 1
voice 1
and 1
waited 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
them 1
suddenly 1
his 1
bearskin 1
fell 1
off 1
and 1
he 1
stood 1
there 1
a 1
handsome 1
man 1
clothed 1
all 1
in 1
gold 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
he 1
said 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
bewitched 1
by 1
that 1
wicked 1
dwarf 1
who 1
had 1
stolen 1
my 1
treasures 1
I 1
have 1
had 1
to 1
run 1
about 1
the 1
forest 1
as 1
a 1
savage 1
bear 1
until 1
I 1
was 1
freed 1
by 1
his 1
death 1
Now 1
he 1
has 1
got 1
his 1
well 1
deserved 1
punishment 1
Snow 1
white 1
was 1
married 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
Rose 1
red 1
to 1
his 1
brother 1
and 1
they 1
divided 1
between 1
them 1
the 1
great 1
treasure 1
which 1
the 1
dwarf 1
had 1
gathered 1
together 1
in 1
his 1
cave 1
The 1
old 1
mother 1
lived 1
peacefully 1
and 1
happily 1
with 1
her 1
children 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
She 1
took 1
the 1
two 1
rose 1
trees 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
they 1
stood 1
before 1
her 1
window 1
and 1
every 1
year 1
bore 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
roses 1
white 1
and 1
red 1
The 1
Brothers 1
Grimm 1
Jacob 1
and 1
Wilhelm 1
were 1
born 1
in 1
Hanau 1
near 1
Frankfurt 1
in 1
the 1
German 1
state 1
of 1
Hesse 1
Throughout 1
their 1
lives 1
they 1
remained 1
close 1
friends 1
and 1
both 1
studied 1
law 1
at 1
Marburg 1
University 1
Jacob 1
was 1
a 1
pioneer 1
in 1
the 1
study 1
of 1
German 1
philology 1
and 1
although 1
Wilhelm 1
s 1
work 1
was 1
hampered 1
by 1
poor 1
health 1
the 1
brothers 1
collaborated 1
in 1
the 1
creation 1
of 1
a 1
German 1
dictionary 1
not 1
completed 1
until 1
a 1
century 1
after 1
their 1
deaths 1
But 1
they 1
were 1
best 1
and 1
universally 1
known 1
for 1
the 1
collection 1
of 1
over 1
two 1
hundred 1
folk 1
tales 1
they 1
made 1
from 1
oral 1
sources 1
and 1
published 1
in 1
two 1
volumes 1
of 1
Nursery 1
and 1
Household 1
Tales 1
in 1
and 1
Although 1
their 1
intention 1
was 1
to 1
preserve 1
such 1
material 1
as 1
part 1
of 1
German 1
cultural 1
and 1
literary 1
history 1
and 1
their 1
collection 1
was 1
first 1
published 1
with 1
scholarly 1
notes 1
and 1
no 1
illustration 1
the 1
tales 1
soon 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
possession 1
of 1
young 1
readers 1
This 1
was 1
in 1
part 1
due 1
to 1
Edgar 1
Taylor 1
who 1
made 1
the 1
first 1
English 1
translation 1
in 1
selecting 1
about 1
fifty 1
stories 1
with 1
the 1
amusement 1
of 1
some 1
young 1
friends 1
principally 1
in 1
view 1
They 1
have 1
been 1
an 1
essential 1
ingredient 1
