SCENE 1
Morning 1

Algernon 1
s 1
flat 1
in 1
Half 1
Moon 1
Street 1
The 1
room 1
is 1
luxuriously 1
and 1
artistically 1
furnished 1
The 1
sound 1
of 1
a 1
piano 1
is 1
heard 1
in 1
the 1
adjoining 1
room 1
Lane 1
is 1
arranging 1
afternoon 1
tea 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
music 1
has 1
ceased 1
Algernon 1
enters 1
Algernon 1
Did 1
you 1
hear 1
what 1
I 1
was 1
playing 1
Lane 2
I 1
didn 1
t 1
think 1
it 1
polite 1
to 1
listen 1
sir 1
Algernon 1
I 1
m 1
sorry 1
for 1
that 1
for 1
your 1
sake 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
play 1
accurately 1
any 1
one 1
can 1
play 1
accurately 1
but 1
I 1
play 1
with 1
wonderful 1
expression 1
As 1
far 1
as 1
the 1
piano 1
is 1
concerned 1
sentiment 1
is 1
my 1
forte 1
I 1
keep 1
science 1
for 1
Life 1
Lane 1
Yes 1
sir 1
Algernon 1
And 1
speaking 1
of 1
the 1
science 1
of 1
Life 1
have 1
you 1
got 1
the 1
cucumber 1
sandwiches 1
cut 1
for 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Lane 1
Yes 1
sir 1
Hands 1
them 1
on 1
a 1
salver 1
Algernon 1
Inspects 1
them 1
takes 1
two 1
and 1
sits 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
sofa 1
Oh 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
Lane 1
I 1
see 1
from 1
your 1
book 1
that 1
on 1
Thursday 1
night 1
when 1
Lord 1
Shoreman 1
and 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
were 1
dining 1
with 1
me 1
eight 1
bottles 1
of 1
champagne 1
are 1
entered 1
as 1
having 1
been 1
consumed 1
Lane 1
Yes 1
sir 1
eight 1
bottles 1
and 1
a 1
pint 1
Algernon 1
Why 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
at 1
a 1
bachelor 1
s 1
establishment 1
the 1
servants 1
invariably 1
drink 1
the 1
champagne 1
I 1
ask 1
merely 1
for 1
information 1
Lane 1
I 1
attribute 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
superior 1
quality 1
of 1
the 1
wine 1
sir 1
I 1
have 1
often 1
observed 1
that 1
in 1
married 1
households 1
the 1
champagne 1
is 1
rarely 1
of 1
a 1
first 1
rate 1
brand 1
Algernon 1
Good 1
heavens 1
Is 1
marriage 1
so 1
demoralising 1
as 1
that 1
Lane 1
I 1
believe 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
pleasant 1
state 1
sir 1
I 1
have 1
had 1
very 1
little 1
experience 1
of 1
it 1
myself 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
present 1
I 1
have 1
only 1
been 1
married 1
once 1
That 1
was 1
in 1
consequence 1
of 1
a 1
misunderstanding 1
between 1
myself 1
and 1
a 1
young 1
person 1
Algernon 1
Languidly 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
much 1
interested 1
in 1
your 1
family 1
life 1
Lane 2
No 1
sir 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
very 1
interesting 1
subject 1
I 1
never 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
myself 1
Algernon 1
Very 1
natural 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
That 1
will 1
do 1
Lane 1
thank 1
you 1
Lane 1
Thank 1
you 1
sir 1
Lane 1
goes 1
out 1
Algernon 1
Lane 1
s 1
views 1
on 1
marriage 1
seem 1
somewhat 1
lax 1
Really 1
if 1
the 1
lower 1
orders 1
don 1
t 1
set 1
us 1
a 1
good 1
example 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
is 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
them 1
They 1
seem 1
as 1
a 1
class 1
to 1
have 1
absolutely 1
no 1
sense 1
of 1
moral 1
responsibility 1
Enter 1

Ernest 1
Worthing 1
Enter 1
Jack 1

goes 1
out 1
Algernon 1
How 1
are 1
you 1
my 1
dear 1
Ernest 1
What 1
brings 1
you 1
up 1
to 1
town 1
Jack 1
Oh 1
pleasure 2
What 1
else 1
should 1
bring 1
one 1
anywhere 1
Eating 1
as 1
usual 1
I 1
see 1
Algy 1
Algernon 1
Stiffly 1
I 1
believe 1
it 1
is 1
customary 1
in 1
good 1
society 1
to 1
take 1
some 1
slight 1
refreshment 1
at 1
five 1
o 1
clock 1
Where 1
have 1
you 1
been 1
since 1
last 1
Thursday 1
Jack 1
Sitting 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
sofa 1
In 1
the 1
country 1
Algernon 1
What 1
on 1
earth 1
do 1
you 1
do 1
there 1
Jack 1
Pulling 1
off 1
his 1
gloves 1
When 1
one 1
is 1
in 1
town 1
one 1
amuses 1
oneself 1
When 1
one 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
one 1
amuses 1
other 1
people 1
It 1
is 1
excessively 1
boring 1
Algernon 1
And 1
who 1
are 1
the 1
people 1
you 1
amuse 1
Jack 1
Airily 1
Oh 1
neighbours 2
Algernon 1
Got 1
nice 1
neighbours 1
in 1
your 1
part 1
of 1
Shropshire 1
Jack 1
Perfectly 1
horrid 1
Never 1
speak 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
Algernon 1
How 1
immensely 1
you 1
must 1
amuse 1
them 1
Goes 1
over 1
and 1
takes 1
sandwich 1
By 1
the 1
way 1
Shropshire 1
is 1
your 1
county 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
Jack 1
Eh 1
Shropshire 1
Yes 1
of 1
course 1
Hallo 1
Why 1
all 1
these 1
cups 1
Why 1
cucumber 1
sandwiches 1
Why 1
such 1
reckless 1
extravagance 1
in 1
one 1
so 1
young 1
Who 1
is 1
coming 1
to 1
tea 1
Algernon 1
Oh 1
merely 1
Aunt 1
Augusta 1
and 1
Gwendolen 1
Jack 1
How 1
perfectly 1
delightful 1
Algernon 1
Yes 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
very 1
well 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
Aunt 1
Augusta 1
won 1
t 1
quite 1
approve 1
of 1
your 1
being 1
here 1
Jack 1
May 1
I 1
ask 1
why 1
Algernon 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
the 1
way 1
you 1
flirt 1
with 1
Gwendolen 1
is 1
perfectly 1
disgraceful 1
It 1
is 1
almost 1
as 1
bad 1
as 1
the 1
way 1
Gwendolen 1
flirts 1
with 1
you 1
Jack 1
I 1
am 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
Gwendolen 1
I 1
have 1
come 1
up 1
to 1
town 1
expressly 1
to 1
propose 1
to 1
her 1
Algernon 1
I 1
thought 1
you 1
had 1
come 1
up 1
for 1
pleasure 1
I 1
call 1
that 1
business 1
Jack 1
How 1
utterly 1
unromantic 1
you 1
are 1
Algernon 1
I 1
really 1
don 1
t 1
see 1
anything 1
romantic 1
in 1
proposing 1
It 1
is 1
very 1
romantic 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
love 1
But 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
romantic 1
about 1
a 1
definite 1
proposal 1
Why 1
one 1
may 1
be 1
accepted 1
One 1
usually 1
is 1
I 1
believe 1
Then 1
the 1
excitement 1
is 1
all 1
over 1
The 1
very 1
essence 1
of 1
romance 1
is 1
uncertainty 1
If 1
ever 1
I 1
get 1
married 1
I 1
ll 1
certainly 1
try 1
to 1
forget 1
the 1
fact 1
Jack 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
about 1
that 1
dear 1
Algy 1
The 1
Divorce 1
Court 1
was 1
specially 1
invented 1
for 1
people 1
whose 1
memories 1
are 1
so 1
curiously 1
constituted 1
Algernon 1
Oh 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
use 1
speculating 1
on 1
that 1
subject 1
Divorces 1
are 1
made 1
in 1
Heaven 1
Jack 1
puts 1
out 1
his 1
hand 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
sandwich 1
Algernon 1
at 1
once 1
interferes 1
Please 1
don 1
t 1
touch 1
the 1
cucumber 1
sandwiches 1
They 1
are 1
ordered 1
specially 1
for 1
Aunt 1
Augusta 1
Takes 1
one 1
and 1
eats 1
it 1
Jack 1
Well 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
eating 1
them 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
Algernon 1
That 1
is 1
quite 1
a 1
different 1
matter 1
She 1
is 1
my 1
aunt 1
Takes 1
plate 1
from 1
below 1
Have 1
some 1
bread 1
and 1
butter 1
The 1
bread 1
and 1
butter 1
is 1
for 1
Gwendolen 2
is 1
devoted 1
to 1
bread 1
and 1
butter 1
Jack 1
Advancing 1
to 1
table 1
and 1
helping 1
himself 1
And 1
very 1
good 1
bread 1
and 1
butter 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
Algernon 1
Well 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
you 1
need 1
not 1
eat 1
as 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
eat 1
it 1
all 1
You 1
behave 1
as 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
married 1
to 1
her 1
already 1
You 1
are 1
not 1
married 1
to 1
her 1
already 1
and 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
you 1
ever 1
will 1
be 1
Jack 1
Why 1
on 1
earth 1
do 1
you 1
say 1
that 1
Algernon 1
Well 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
place 1
girls 1
never 1
marry 1
the 1
men 1
they 1
flirt 1
with 1
Girls 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
it 1
right 1
Jack 1
Oh 1
that 1
is 1
nonsense 1
Algernon 1
It 1
isn 1
t 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
truth 1
It 1
accounts 1
for 1
the 1
extraordinary 1
number 1
of 1
bachelors 1
that 1
one 1
sees 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
place 1
In 1
the 1
second 1
place 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
give 1
my 1
consent 1
Jack 1
Your 1
consent 1
Algernon 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
Gwendolen 1
is 1
my 1
first 1
cousin 1
And 1
before 1
I 1
allow 1
you 1
to 1
marry 1
her 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
to 1
clear 1
up 1
the 1
whole 1
question 1
of 1
Cecily 1
Rings 1
bell 1
Jack 1
Cecily 1
What 1
on 1
earth 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
Algy 1
by 1
Cecily 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
any 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
Cecily 1
Enter 1
Lane 1
Algernon 1
Bring 1
me 1
that 1
cigarette 1
case 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
left 1
in 1
the 1
smoking 1
room 1
the 1
last 1
time 1
he 1
dined 1
here 1
Lane 1
Yes 1
sir 1
Lane 1
goes 1
out 1
Jack 1
Do 1
you 1
mean 1
to 1
say 1
you 1
have 1
had 1
my 1
cigarette 1
case 1
all 1
this 1
time 1
I 1
wish 1
to 1
goodness 1
you 1
had 1
let 1
me 1
know 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
writing 1
frantic 1
letters 1
to 1
Scotland 1
Yard 1
about 1
it 1
I 1
was 1
very 1
nearly 1
offering 1
a 1
large 1
reward 1
Algernon 1
Well 1
I 1
wish 1
you 1
would 1
offer 1
one 1
I 1
happen 1
to 1
be 1
more 1
than 1
usually 1
hard 1
up 1
Jack 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
good 1
offering 1
a 1
large 1
reward 1
now 1
that 1
the 1
thing 1
is 1
found 1
Enter 1
Lane 1
with 1
the 1
cigarette 1
case 1
on 1
a 1
salver 1
Algernon 1
takes 1
it 1
at 1
once 1
Lane 1
goes 1
out 1
Algernon 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
is 1
rather 1
mean 1
of 1
you 1
Ernest 1
I 1
must 1
say 1
Opens 1
case 1
and 1
examines 1
it 1
However 1
it 1
makes 1
no 1
matter 1
for 1
now 1
that 1
I 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
inscription 1
inside 1
I 1
find 1
that 1
the 1
thing 1
isn 1
t 1
yours 1
after 1
all 1
Jack 1
Of 1
course 1
it 1
s 1
mine 1
Moving 1
to 1
him 1
You 1
have 1
seen 1
me 1
with 1
it 1
a 1
hundred 1
times 1
and 1
you 1
have 1
no 1
right 1
whatsoever 1
to 1
read 1
what 1
is 1
written 1
inside 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
ungentlemanly 1
thing 1
to 1
read 1
a 1
private 1
cigarette 1
case 1
Algernon 1
Oh 1
it 1
is 1
absurd 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
hard 1
and 1
fast 1
rule 1
about 1
what 1
one 1
should 1
read 1
and 1
what 1
one 1
shouldn 1
t 1
More 1
than 1
half 1
of 1
modern 1
culture 1
depends 1
on 1
what 1
one 1
shouldn 1
t 1
read 1
Jack 1
I 1
am 1
quite 1
aware 1
of 1
the 1
fact 1
and 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
propose 1
to 1
discuss 1
modern 1
culture 1
It 1
isn 1
t 1
the 1
sort 1
of 1
thing 1
one 1
should 1
talk 1
of 1
in 1
private 1
I 1
simply 1
want 1
my 1
cigarette 1
case 1
back 1
Algernon 1
Yes 1
but 1
this 1
isn 1
t 1
your 1
cigarette 1
case 1
This 1
cigarette 1
case 1
is 1
a 1
present 1
from 1
some 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
Cecily 1
and 1
you 1
said 1
you 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
any 1
one 1
of 1
that 1
name 1
Jack 1
Well 1
if 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
know 1
Cecily 1
happens 1
to 1
be 1
my 1
aunt 1
Algernon 1
Your 1
aunt 1
Jack 1
Yes 1
Charming 1
old 1

Algernon 1
Retreating 1
to 1
back 1
of 1
sofa 1
But 1
why 1
does 1
she 1
call 1
herself 1
little 1
Cecily 1
if 1
she 1
is 1
your 1
aunt 1
and 1
lives 1
at 1
Tunbridge 1

From 1

Jack 1
Moving 1
to 1
sofa 1
and 1
kneeling 1
upon 1
it 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
is 1
there 1
in 1
that 1
Some 1
aunts 1
are 1
tall 1
some 1
aunts 1
are 1
not 1
tall 1
That 1
is 1
a 1
matter 1
that 1
surely 1
an 1
aunt 1
may 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
decide 1
for 1
herself 1
You 1
seem 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
every 1
aunt 1
should 1
be 1
exactly 1
like 1
your 1
aunt 1
That 1
is 1
absurd 1
For 1
Heaven 1
s 1
sake 1
give 1
me 1
back 1
my 1
cigarette 1
case 1
Follows 1
Algernon 1
round 1
the 1
room 1
Algernon 1
Yes 1
But 1
why 1
does 1
your 1
aunt 1
call 1
you 1
her 1
uncle 1
From 1
little 1
Cecily 1
with 1
her 1
fondest 1
love 1
to 1
her 1
dear 1
Uncle 1
Jack 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
objection 1
I 1
admit 1
to 1
an 1
aunt 1
being 1
a 1
small 1
aunt 1
but 1
why 1
an 1
aunt 1
no 1
matter 1
what 1
her 1
size 1
may 1
be 1
should 1
call 1
her 1
own 1
nephew 1
her 1
uncle 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
quite 1
make 1
out 1
Besides 1
your 1
name 1
isn 1
t 1
Jack 1
at 1
all 1
it 1
is 1
Ernest 1
Jack 1
It 1
isn 1
t 1
Ernest 1
it 1
s 1
Jack 1
Algernon 1
You 1
have 1
always 1
told 1
me 1
it 1
was 1
Ernest 1
I 1
have 1
introduced 1
you 1
to 1
every 1
one 1
as 1
Ernest 1
You 1
answer 1
to 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
Ernest 1
You 1
look 1
as 1
if 1
your 1
name 1
was 1
Ernest 1
You 1
are 1
the 1
most 1
earnest 1
looking 1
person 1
I 1
ever 1
saw 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
It 1
is 1
perfectly 1
absurd 1
your 1
saying 1
that 1
your 1
name 1
isn 1
t 1
Ernest 1
It 1
s 1
on 1
your 1
cards 1
Here 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
Taking 1
it 1
from 1
case 1
Mr 1
Ernest 1
Worthing 1
B 1
The 1
Albany 1
I 1
ll 1
keep 1
this 1
as 1
a 1
proof 1
that 1
your 1
name 1
is 1
Ernest 1
if 1
ever 1
you 1
attempt 1
to 1
deny 1
it 1
to 1
me 1
or 1
to 1
Gwendolen 1
or 1
to 1
any 1
one 1
else 1
Puts 1
the 1
card 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
Jack 1
Well 1
my 1
name 1
is 1
Ernest 1
in 1
town 1
and 1
Jack 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
and 1
the 1
cigarette 1
case 1
was 1
given 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
Algernon 1
Yes 1
but 1
that 1
does 1
not 1
account 1
for 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
your 1
small 1
Aunt 1
Cecily 1
who 1
lives 1
at 1
Tunbridge 1
Wells 1
calls 1
you 1
her 1
dear 1
uncle 1
Come 1
old 1
boy 1
you 1
had 1
much 1
better 1
have 1
the 1
thing 1
out 1
at 1
once 1
Jack 1
My 1
dear 1
Algy 1
you 1
talk 1
exactly 1
as 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
a 1
dentist 1
It 1
is 1
very 1
vulgar 1
to 1
talk 1
like 1
a 1
dentist 1
when 1
one 1
isn 1
t 1
a 1
dentist 1
It 1
produces 1
a 1
false 1
impression 1
Algernon 1
Well 1
that 1
is 1
exactly 1
what 1
dentists 1
always 1
do 1
Now 1
go 1
on 1
Tell 1
me 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
I 1
may 1
mention 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
always 1
suspected 1
you 1
of 1
being 1
a 1
confirmed 1
and 1
secret 1
Bunburyist 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
quite 1
sure 1
of 1
it 1
now 1
Jack 1
Bunburyist 1
What 1
on 1
earth 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
by 1
a 1
Bunburyist 1
Algernon 1
I 1
ll 1
reveal 1
to 1
you 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
that 1
incomparable 1
expression 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
kind 1
enough 1
to 1
inform 1
me 1
why 1
you 1
are 1
Ernest 1
in 1
town 1
and 1
Jack 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
Jack 1
Well 1
produce 1
my 1
cigarette 1
case 1
first 1
Algernon 1
Here 1
it 1
is 1
Hands 1
cigarette 1
case 1
Now 1
produce 1
your 1
explanation 1
and 1
pray 1
make 1
it 1
improbable 1
Sits 1
on 1
sofa 1
Jack 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
improbable 1
about 1
my 1
explanation 1
at 1
all 1
In 1
fact 1
it 1
s 1
perfectly 1
ordinary 1
Old 1
Mr 1
Thomas 1
Cardew 1
who 1
adopted 1
me 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
boy 1
made 1
me 1
in 1
his 1
will 1
guardian 1
to 1
his 1
grand 1
daughter 1
Miss 1
Cecily 1
Cardew 1
Cecily 1
who 1
addresses 1
me 1
as 1
her 1
uncle 1
from 1
motives 1
of 1
respect 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
not 1
possibly 1
appreciate 1
lives 1
at 1
my 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
under 1
the 1
charge 1
of 1
her 1
admirable 1
governess 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
Algernon 1
Where 1
is 1
that 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
Jack 1
That 1
is 1
nothing 1
to 1
you 1
dear 1
boy 1
You 1
are 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
invited 1
I 1
may 1
tell 1
you 1
candidly 1
that 1
the 1
place 1
is 1
not 1
in 1
Shropshire 1
Algernon 1
I 1
suspected 1
that 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
I 1
have 1
Bunburyed 1
all 1
over 1
Shropshire 1
on 1
two 1
separate 1
occasions 1
Now 1
go 1
on 1
Why 1
are 1
you 1
Ernest 1
in 1
town 1
and 1
Jack 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
Jack 1
My 1
dear 1
Algy 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
whether 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
understand 1
my 1
real 1
motives 1
You 1
are 1
hardly 1
serious 1
enough 1
When 1
one 1
is 1
placed 1
in 1
the 1
position 1
of 1
guardian 1
one 1
has 1
to 1
adopt 1
a 1
very 1
high 1
moral 1
tone 1
on 1
all 1
subjects 1
It 1
s 1
one 1
s 1
duty 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
And 1
as 1
a 1
high 1
moral 1
tone 1
can 1
hardly 1
be 1
said 1
to 1
conduce 1
very 1
much 1
to 1
either 1
one 1
s 1
health 1
or 1
one 1
s 1
happiness 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
to 1
town 1
I 1
have 1
always 1
pretended 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
younger 1
brother 1
of 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
Ernest 1
who 1
lives 1
in 1
the 1
Albany 1
and 1
gets 1
into 1
the 1
most 1
dreadful 1
scrapes 1
That 1
my 1
dear 1
Algy 1
is 1
the 1
whole 1
truth 1
pure 1
and 1
simple 1
Algernon 1
The 1
truth 1
is 1
rarely 1
pure 1
and 1
never 1
simple 1
Modern 1
life 1
would 1
be 1
very 1
tedious 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
either 1
and 1
modern 1
literature 1
a 1
complete 1
impossibility 1
Jack 1
That 1
wouldn 1
t 1
be 1
at 1
all 1
a 1
bad 1
thing 1
Algernon 1
Literary 1
criticism 1
is 1
not 1
your 1
forte 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
Don 1
t 1
try 1
it 1
You 1
should 1
leave 1
that 1
to 1
people 1
who 1
haven 1
t 1
been 1
at 1
a 1
University 1
They 1
do 1
it 1
so 1
well 1
in 1
the 1
daily 1
papers 1
What 1
you 1
really 1
are 1
is 1
a 1
Bunburyist 1
I 1
was 1
quite 1
right 1
in 1
saying 1
you 1
were 1
a 1
Bunburyist 1
You 1
are 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
advanced 1
Bunburyists 1
I 1
know 1
Jack 1
What 1
on 1
earth 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
Algernon 1
You 1
have 1
invented 1
a 1
very 1
useful 1
younger 1
brother 1
called 1
Ernest 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
come 1
up 1
to 1
town 1
as 1
often 1
as 1
you 1
like 1
I 1
have 1
invented 1
an 1
invaluable 1
permanent 1
invalid 1
called 1
Bunbury 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
go 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
country 1
whenever 1
I 1
choose 1
Bunbury 1
is 1
perfectly 1
invaluable 1
If 1
it 1
wasn 1
t 1
for 1
Bunbury 1
s 1
extraordinary 1
bad 1
health 1
for 1
instance 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
dine 1
with 1
you 1
at 1
Willis 1
s 1
to 1
night 1
for 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
really 1
engaged 1
to 1
Aunt 1
Augusta 1
for 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
week 1
Jack 1
I 1
haven 1
t 1
asked 1
you 1
to 1
dine 1
with 1
me 1
anywhere 1
to 1
night 1
Algernon 1
I 1
know 1
You 1
are 1
absurdly 1
careless 1
about 1
sending 1
out 1
invitations 1
It 1
is 1
very 1
foolish 1
of 1
you 1
Nothing 1
annoys 1
people 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
not 1
receiving 1
invitations 1
Jack 1
You 1
had 1
much 1
better 1
dine 1
with 1
your 1
Aunt 1
Augusta 1
Algernon 1
I 1
haven 1
t 1
the 1
smallest 1
intention 1
of 1
doing 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
To 1
begin 1
with 1
I 1
dined 1
there 1
on 1
Monday 1
and 1
once 1
a 1
week 1
is 1
quite 1
enough 1
to 1
dine 1
with 1
one 1
s 1
own 1
relations 1
In 1
the 1
second 1
place 1
whenever 1
I 1
do 1
dine 1
there 1
I 1
am 1
always 1
treated 1
as 1
a 1
member 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
and 1
sent 1
down 1
with 1
either 1
no 1
woman 1
at 1
all 1
or 1
two 1
In 1
the 1
third 1
place 1
I 1
know 1
perfectly 1
well 1
whom 1
she 1
will 1
place 1
me 1
next 1
to 2
night 1
She 1
will 1
place 1
me 1
next 1
Mary 1
Farquhar 1
who 1
always 1
flirts 1
with 1
her 1
own 1
husband 1
across 1
the 1
dinner 1
table 1
That 1
is 1
not 1
very 1
pleasant 1
Indeed 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
even 1
decent 1
and 1
that 1
sort 1
of 1
thing 1
is 1
enormously 1
on 1
the 1
increase 1
The 1
amount 1
of 1
women 1
in 1
London 1
who 1
flirt 1
with 1
their 1
own 1
husbands 1
is 1
perfectly 1
scandalous 1
It 1
looks 1
so 1
bad 1
It 1
is 1
simply 1
washing 1
one 1
s 1
clean 1
linen 1
in 1
public 1
Besides 1
now 1
that 1
I 1
know 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
confirmed 1
Bunburyist 1
I 1
naturally 1
want 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
you 1
about 1
Bunburying 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
the 1
rules 1
Jack 1
I 1
m 1
not 1
a 1
Bunburyist 1
at 1
all 1
If 1
Gwendolen 1
accepts 1
me 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
kill 1
my 1
brother 1
indeed 1
I 1
think 1
I 1
ll 1
kill 1
him 1
in 1
any 1
case 1
Cecily 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
much 1
interested 1
in 1
him 1
It 1
is 1
rather 1
a 1
bore 1
So 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
Ernest 1
And 1
I 1
strongly 1
advise 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
same 1
with 1
Mr 1
with 1
your 1
invalid 1
friend 1
who 1
has 1
the 1
absurd 1
name 1
Algernon 1
Nothing 1
will 1
induce 1
me 1
to 1
part 1
with 1
Bunbury 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
ever 1
get 1
married 1
which 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
extremely 1
problematic 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
very 1
glad 1
to 1
know 1
Bunbury 1
A 1
man 1
who 1
marries 1
without 1
knowing 1
Bunbury 1
has 1
a 1
very 1
tedious 1
time 1
of 1
it 1
Jack 1
That 1
is 1
nonsense 1
If 1
I 1
marry 1
a 1
charming 1
girl 1
like 1
Gwendolen 1
and 1
she 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
girl 1
I 1
ever 1
saw 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
that 1
I 1
would 1
marry 1
I 1
certainly 1
won 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
know 1
Bunbury 1
Algernon 1
Then 1
your 1
wife 1
will 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
realise 1
that 1
in 1
married 1
life 1
three 1
is 1
company 1
and 1
two 1
is 1
none 1
Jack 1
Sententiously 1
That 1
my 1
dear 1
young 1
friend 1
is 1
the 1
theory 1
that 1
the 1
corrupt 1
French 1
Drama 1
has 1
been 1
propounding 1
for 1
the 1
last 1
fifty 1
years 1
Algernon 1
Yes 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
happy 1
English 1
home 1
has 1
proved 1
in 1
half 1
the 1
time 1
Jack 1
For 1
heaven 1
s 1
sake 1
don 1
t 1
try 1
to 1
be 1
cynical 1
It 1
s 1
perfectly 1
easy 1
to 1
be 1
cynical 1
Algernon 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
it 1
isn 1
t 1
easy 1
to 1
be 1
anything 1
nowadays 1
There 1
s 1
such 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
beastly 1
competition 1
about 1
The 1
sound 1
of 1
an 1
electric 1
bell 1
is 1
heard 1
Ah 1
that 1
must 1
be 1
Aunt 1
Augusta 1
Only 1
relatives 1
or 1
creditors 1
ever 1
ring 1
in 1
that 1
Wagnerian 1
manner 1
Now 1
if 1
I 1
get 1
her 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
for 1
ten 1
minutes 1
so 1
that 1
you 1
can 1
have 1
an 1
opportunity 1
for 1
proposing 1
to 1
Gwendolen 1
may 1
I 1
dine 1
with 1
you 1
to 1
night 1
at 1
Willis 1
s 1
Jack 1
I 1
suppose 1
so 1
if 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
Algernon 1
Yes 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
be 1
serious 1
about 1
it 1
I 1
hate 1
people 1
who 1
are 1
not 1
serious 1
about 1
meals 1
It 1
is 1
so 1
shallow 1
of 1
them 1
Enter 1
Lane 2
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
and 1
Miss 1
Fairfax 1
Algernon 1
goes 1
forward 1
to 1
meet 1
them 1
Enter 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
and 1
Gwendolen 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Good 1
afternoon 1
dear 1
Algernon 1
I 1
hope 1
you 1
are 1
behaving 1
very 1
well 1
Algernon 1
I 1
m 1
feeling 1
very 1
well 1
Aunt 1
Augusta 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
That 1
s 1
not 1
quite 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
In 1
fact 1
the 1
two 1
things 1
rarely 1
go 1
together 1
Sees 1
Jack 1
and 1
bows 1
to 1
him 1
with 1
icy 1
coldness 1
Algernon 1
To 1
Gwendolen 1
Dear 1
me 1
you 1
are 1
smart 1
Gwendolen 1
I 1
am 1
always 1
smart 1
Am 1
I 1
not 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
Jack 1
You 1
re 1
quite 1
perfect 1
Miss 1
Fairfax 1
Gwendolen 1
Oh 1
I 1
hope 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
that 1
It 1
would 1
leave 1
no 1
room 1
for 1
developments 1
and 1
I 1
intend 1
to 1
develop 1
in 1
many 1
directions 1
Gwendolen 1
and 1
Jack 1
sit 1
down 1
together 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
I 1
m 1
sorry 1
if 1
we 1
are 1
a 1
little 1
late 1
Algernon 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
call 1
on 1
dear 1
Lady 1
Harbury 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
been 1
there 1
since 1
her 1
poor 1
husband 1
s 1
death 1
I 1
never 1
saw 1
a 1
woman 1
so 1
altered 1
she 1
looks 1
quite 1
twenty 1
years 1
younger 1
And 1
now 1
I 1
ll 1
have 1
a 1
cup 1
of 1
tea 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
nice 1
cucumber 1
sandwiches 1
you 1
promised 1
me 1
Algernon 1
Certainly 1
Aunt 1
Augusta 1
Goes 1
over 1
to 1
tea 1
table 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Won 1
t 1
you 1
come 1
and 1
sit 1
here 1
Gwendolen 2
Thanks 1
mamma 1
I 1
m 1
quite 1
comfortable 1
where 1
I 1
am 1
Algernon 1
Picking 1
up 1
empty 1
plate 1
in 1
horror 1
Good 1
heavens 1
Lane 1
Why 1
are 1
there 1
no 1
cucumber 1
sandwiches 1
I 1
ordered 1
them 1
specially 1
Lane 1
Gravely 1
There 1
were 1
no 1
cucumbers 1
in 1
the 1
market 1
this 1
morning 1
sir 1
I 1
went 1
down 1
twice 1
Algernon 1
No 1
cucumbers 1
Lane 1
No 1
sir 1
Not 1
even 1
for 1
ready 1
money 1
Algernon 1
That 1
will 1
do 1
Lane 1
thank 1
you 1
Lane 1
Thank 1
you 1
sir 1
Goes 1
out 1
Algernon 1
I 1
am 1
greatly 1
distressed 1
Aunt 1
Augusta 1
about 1
there 1
being 1
no 1
cucumbers 1
not 1
even 1
for 1
ready 1
money 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
It 1
really 1
makes 1
no 1
matter 1
Algernon 1
I 1
had 1
some 1
crumpets 1
with 1
Lady 1
Harbury 1
who 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
living 1
entirely 1
for 1
pleasure 1
now 1
Algernon 1
I 1
hear 1
her 1
hair 1
has 1
turned 1
quite 1
gold 1
from 1
grief 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
It 1
certainly 1
has 1
changed 1
its 1
colour 1
From 1
what 1
cause 1
I 1
of 1
course 1
cannot 1
say 1
Algernon 1
crosses 1
and 1
hands 1
tea 1
Thank 1
you 1
I 1
ve 1
quite 1
a 1
treat 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
night 1
Algernon 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
send 1
you 1
down 1
with 1
Mary 1
Farquhar 1
She 1
is 1
such 1
a 1
nice 1
woman 1
and 1
so 1
attentive 1
to 1
her 1
husband 1
It 1
s 1
delightful 1
to 1
watch 1
them 1
Algernon 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
Aunt 1
Augusta 1
I 1
shall 1
have 1
to 1
give 1
up 1
the 1
pleasure 1
of 1
dining 1
with 1
you 1
to 1
night 1
after 1
all 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Frowning 1
I 1
hope 1
not 1
Algernon 1
It 1
would 1
put 1
my 1
table 1
completely 1
out 1
Your 1
uncle 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
dine 1
upstairs 1
Fortunately 1
he 1
is 1
accustomed 1
to 1
that 1
Algernon 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
bore 1
and 1
I 1
need 1
hardly 1
say 1
a 1
terrible 1
disappointment 1
to 1
me 1
but 1
the 1
fact 1
is 1
I 1
have 1
just 1
had 1
a 1
telegram 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
my 1
poor 1
friend 1
Bunbury 1
is 1
very 1
ill 1
again 1
Exchanges 1
glances 1
with 1
Jack 1
They 1
seem 1
to 1
think 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
with 1
him 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
It 1
is 1
very 1
strange 1
This 1
Mr 1
Bunbury 1
seems 1
to 1
suffer 1
from 1
curiously 1
bad 1
health 1
Algernon 1
Yes 1
poor 1
Bunbury 1
is 1
a 1
dreadful 1
invalid 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Well 1
I 1
must 1
say 1
Algernon 1
that 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
high 1
time 1
that 1
Mr 1
Bunbury 1
made 1
up 1
his 1
mind 1
whether 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
live 1
or 1
to 1
die 1
This 1
shilly 1
shallying 1
with 1
the 1
question 1
is 1
absurd 1
Nor 1
do 1
I 1
in 1
any 1
way 1
approve 1
of 1
the 1
modern 1
sympathy 1
with 1
invalids 1
I 1
consider 1
it 1
morbid 1
Illness 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
is 1
hardly 1
a 1
thing 1
to 1
be 1
encouraged 1
in 1
others 1
Health 1
is 1
the 1
primary 1
duty 1
of 1
life 1
I 1
am 1
always 1
telling 1
that 1
to 1
your 1
poor 1
uncle 1
but 1
he 1
never 1
seems 1
to 1
take 1
much 1
notice 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
any 1
improvement 1
in 1
his 1
ailment 1
goes 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
much 1
obliged 1
if 1
you 1
would 1
ask 1
Mr 1
Bunbury 1
from 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
kind 1
enough 1
not 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
relapse 1
on 1
Saturday 1
for 1
I 1
rely 1
on 1
you 1
to 1
arrange 1
my 1
music 1
for 1
me 1
It 1
is 1
my 1
last 1
reception 1
and 1
one 1
wants 1
something 1
that 1
will 1
encourage 1
conversation 1
particularly 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
season 1
when 1
every 1
one 1
has 1
practically 1
said 1
whatever 1
they 1
had 1
to 1
say 1
which 1
in 1
most 1
cases 1
was 1
probably 1
not 1
much 1
Algernon 1
I 1
ll 1
speak 1
to 1
Bunbury 1
Aunt 1
Augusta 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
still 1
conscious 1
and 1
I 1
think 1
I 1
can 1
promise 1
you 1
he 1
ll 1
be 1
all 1
right 1
by 1
Saturday 1
Of 1
course 1
the 1
music 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
difficulty 1
You 1
see 1
if 1
one 1
plays 1
good 1
music 1
people 1
don 1
t 1
listen 1
and 1
if 1
one 1
plays 1
bad 1
music 1
people 1
don 1
t 1
talk 1
But 1
I 1
ll 1
run 1
over 1
the 1
programme 1
I 1
ve 1
drawn 1
out 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
kindly 1
come 1
into 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Thank 1
you 1
Algernon 1
It 1
is 1
very 1
thoughtful 1
of 1
you 1
Rising 1
and 1
following 1
Algernon 1
I 1
m 1
sure 1
the 1
programme 1
will 1
be 1
delightful 1
after 1
a 1
few 1
expurgations 1
French 1
songs 1
I 1
cannot 1
possibly 1
allow 1
People 1
always 1
seem 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
improper 1
and 1
either 1
look 1
shocked 1
which 1
is 1
vulgar 1
or 1
laugh 1
which 1
is 1
worse 1
But 1
German 1
sounds 1
a 1
thoroughly 1
respectable 1
language 1
and 1
indeed 1
I 1
believe 1
is 1
so 1
Gwendolen 1
you 1
will 1
accompany 1
me 1
Gwendolen 1
Certainly 1
mamma 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
and 1
Algernon 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
music 1
room 1
Gwendolen 1
remains 1
behind 1
Jack 1
Charming 1
day 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
Miss 1
Fairfax 1
Gwendolen 1
Pray 1
don 1
t 1
talk 1
to 1
me 1
about 1
the 1
weather 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
Whenever 1
people 1
talk 1
to 1
me 1
about 1
the 1
weather 1
I 1
always 1
feel 1
quite 1
certain 1
that 1
they 1
mean 1
something 1
else 1
And 1
that 1
makes 1
me 1
so 1
nervous 1
Jack 1
I 1
do 1
mean 1
something 1
else 1
Gwendolen 1
I 1
thought 1
so 1
In 1
fact 1
I 1
am 1
never 1
wrong 1
Jack 1
And 1
I 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
take 1
advantage 1
of 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
s 1
temporary 1
absence 1
Gwendolen 1
I 1
would 1
certainly 1
advise 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
Mamma 1
has 1
a 1
way 1
of 1
coming 1
back 1
suddenly 1
into 1
a 1
room 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
often 1
had 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
her 1
about 1
Jack 1
Nervously 1
Miss 1
Fairfax 1
ever 1
since 1
I 1
met 1
you 1
I 1
have 1
admired 1
you 1
more 1
than 1
any 1
girl 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
met 1
since 1
I 1
met 1
you 1
Gwendolen 1
Yes 1
I 1
am 1
quite 1
well 1
aware 1
of 1
the 1
fact 1
And 1
I 1
often 1
wish 1
that 1
in 1
public 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
you 1
had 1
been 1
more 1
demonstrative 1
For 1
me 1
you 1
have 1
always 1
had 1
an 1
irresistible 1
fascination 1
Even 1
before 1
I 1
met 1
you 1
I 1
was 1
far 1
from 1
indifferent 1
to 1
you 1
Jack 1
looks 1
at 1
her 1
in 1
amazement 1
We 1
live 1
as 1
I 1
hope 1
you 1
know 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
in 1
an 1
age 1
of 1
ideals 1
The 1
fact 1
is 1
constantly 1
mentioned 1
in 1
the 1
more 1
expensive 1
monthly 1
magazines 1
and 1
has 1
reached 1
the 1
provincial 1
pulpits 1
I 1
am 1
told 1
and 1
my 1
ideal 1
has 1
always 1
been 1
to 1
love 1
some 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
Ernest 1
There 1
is 1
something 1
in 1
that 1
name 1
that 1
inspires 1
absolute 1
confidence 1
The 1
moment 1
Algernon 1
first 1
mentioned 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
friend 1
called 1
Ernest 1
I 1
knew 1
I 1
was 1
destined 1
to 1
love 1
you 1
Jack 1
You 1
really 1
love 1
me 1
Gwendolen 2
Passionately 1
Jack 1
Darling 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
how 1
happy 1
you 1
ve 1
made 1
me 1
Gwendolen 1
My 1
own 1
Ernest 1
Jack 1
But 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
really 1
mean 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
love 1
me 1
if 1
my 1
name 1
wasn 1
t 1
Ernest 1
Gwendolen 1
But 1
your 1
name 1
is 1
Ernest 1
Jack 1
Yes 1
I 1
know 1
it 1
is 1
But 1
supposing 1
it 1
was 1
something 1
else 1
Do 1
you 1
mean 1
to 1
say 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
love 1
me 1
then 1
Gwendolen 1
Glibly 1
Ah 1
that 1
is 1
clearly 1
a 1
metaphysical 1
speculation 1
and 1
like 1
most 1
metaphysical 1
speculations 1
has 1
very 1
little 1
reference 1
at 1
all 1
to 1
the 1
actual 1
facts 1
of 1
real 1
life 1
as 1
we 1
know 1
them 1
Jack 1
Personally 1
darling 1
to 1
speak 1
quite 1
candidly 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
much 1
care 1
about 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
Ernest 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
the 1
name 1
suits 1
me 1
at 1
all 1
Gwendolen 1
It 1
suits 1
you 1
perfectly 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
divine 1
name 1
It 1
has 1
a 1
music 1
of 1
its 1
own 1
It 1
produces 1
vibrations 1
Jack 1
Well 1
really 1
Gwendolen 1
I 1
must 1
say 1
that 1
I 1
think 1
there 1
are 1
lots 1
of 1
other 1
much 1
nicer 1
names 1
I 1
think 1
Jack 1
for 1
instance 1
a 1
charming 1
name 1
Gwendolen 1
Jack 1
No 1
there 1
is 1
very 1
little 1
music 1
in 1
the 1
name 1
Jack 1
if 1
any 1
at 1
all 1
indeed 1
It 1
does 1
not 1
thrill 1
It 1
produces 1
absolutely 1
no 1
vibrations 1
I 1
have 1
known 1
several 1
Jacks 1
and 1
they 1
all 1
without 1
exception 1
were 1
more 1
than 1
usually 1
plain 1
Besides 1
Jack 1
is 1
a 1
notorious 1
domesticity 1
for 1
John 1
And 1
I 1
pity 1
any 1
woman 1
who 1
is 1
married 1
to 1
a 1
man 1
called 1
John 1
She 1
would 1
probably 1
never 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
know 1
the 1
entrancing 1
pleasure 1
of 1
a 1
single 1
moment 1
s 1
solitude 1
The 1
only 1
really 1
safe 1
name 1
is 1
Ernest 1
Jack 1
Gwendolen 1
I 1
must 1
get 1
christened 1
at 1
once 1
I 1
mean 1
we 1
must 1
get 1
married 1
at 1
once 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
be 1
lost 1
Gwendolen 1
Married 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
Jack 1
Astounded 1
Well 1
surely 1
You 1
know 1
that 1
I 1
love 1
you 1
and 1
you 1
led 1
me 1
to 1
believe 1
Miss 1
Fairfax 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
not 1
absolutely 1
indifferent 1
to 1
me 1
Gwendolen 1
I 1
adore 1
you 1
But 1
you 1
haven 1
t 1
proposed 1
to 1
me 1
yet 1
Nothing 1
has 1
been 1
said 1
at 1
all 1
about 1
marriage 1
The 1
subject 1
has 1
not 1
even 1
been 1
touched 1
on 1
Jack 1
Well 1
may 1
I 1
propose 1
to 1
you 1
now 1
Gwendolen 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
an 1
admirable 1
opportunity 1
And 1
to 1
spare 1
you 1
any 1
possible 1
disappointment 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
only 1
fair 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
quite 1
frankly 1
before 1
hand 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
fully 1
determined 1
to 1
accept 1
you 1
Jack 1
Gwendolen 2
Yes 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
got 1
to 1
say 1
to 1
me 1
Jack 1
You 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
have 1
got 1
to 1
say 1
to 1
you 1
Gwendolen 1
Yes 1
but 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
say 1
it 1
Jack 1
Gwendolen 1
will 1
you 1
marry 1
me 1
Goes 1
on 1
his 1
knees 1
Gwendolen 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
will 1
darling 1
How 1
long 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
about 1
it 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
you 1
have 1
had 1
very 1
little 1
experience 1
in 1
how 1
to 1
propose 1
Jack 1
My 1
own 1
one 1
I 1
have 1
never 1
loved 1
any 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
but 1
you 1
Gwendolen 1
Yes 1
but 1
men 1
often 1
propose 1
for 1
practice 1
I 1
know 1
my 1
brother 1
Gerald 1
does 1
All 1
my 1
girl 1
friends 1
tell 1
me 1
so 1
What 1
wonderfully 1
blue 1
eyes 1
you 1
have 1
Ernest 1
They 1
are 1
quite 2
blue 1
I 1
hope 1
you 1
will 1
always 1
look 1
at 1
me 1
just 1
like 1
that 1
especially 1
when 1
there 1
are 1
other 1
people 1
present 1
Enter 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
Rise 1
sir 1
from 1
this 1
semi 1
recumbent 1
posture 1
It 1
is 1
most 1
indecorous 1
Gwendolen 1
Mamma 1
He 1
tries 1
to 1
rise 1
she 1
restrains 1
him 1
I 1
must 1
beg 1
you 1
to 1
retire 1
This 1
is 1
no 1
place 1
for 1
you 1
Besides 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
has 1
not 1
quite 1
finished 1
yet 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Finished 1
what 1
may 1
I 1
ask 1
Gwendolen 1
I 1
am 1
engaged 1
to 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
mamma 1
They 1
rise 1
together 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Pardon 1
me 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
engaged 1
to 1
any 1
one 1
When 1
you 1
do 1
become 1
engaged 1
to 1
some 1
one 1
I 1
or 1
your 1
father 1
should 1
his 1
health 1
permit 1
him 1
will 1
inform 1
you 1
of 1
the 1
fact 1
An 1
engagement 1
should 1
come 1
on 1
a 1
young 1
girl 1
as 1
a 1
surprise 1
pleasant 1
or 1
unpleasant 1
as 1
the 1
case 1
may 1
be 1
It 1
is 1
hardly 1
a 1
matter 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
arrange 1
for 1
herself 1
And 1
now 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
few 1
questions 1
to 1
put 1
to 1
you 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
While 1
I 1
am 1
making 1
these 1
inquiries 1
you 1
Gwendolen 1
will 1
wait 1
for 1
me 1
below 1
in 1
the 1
carriage 1
Gwendolen 1
Reproachfully 1
Mamma 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
In 1
the 1
carriage 1
Gwendolen 2
goes 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
She 1
and 1
Jack 1
blow 1
kisses 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
behind 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
s 1
back 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
looks 1
vaguely 1
about 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
understand 1
what 1
the 1
noise 1
was 1
Finally 1
turns 1
round 1
Gwendolen 1
the 1
carriage 1
Gwendolen 1
Yes 1
mamma 1
Goes 1
out 1
looking 1
back 1
at 1
Jack 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Sitting 1
down 1
You 1
can 1
take 1
a 1
seat 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
Looks 1
in 1
her 1
pocket 1
for 1
note 1
book 1
and 1
pencil 1
Jack 1
Thank 1
you 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
I 1
prefer 1
standing 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Pencil 1
and 1
note 1
book 1
in 1
hand 1
I 1
feel 1
bound 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
down 1
on 1
my 1
list 1
of 1
eligible 1
young 1
men 1
although 1
I 1
have 1
the 1
same 1
list 1
as 1
the 1
dear 1
Duchess 1
of 1
Bolton 1
has 1
We 1
work 1
together 1
in 1
fact 1
However 1
I 1
am 1
quite 1
ready 1
to 1
enter 1
your 1
name 1
should 1
your 1
answers 1
be 1
what 1
a 1
really 1
affectionate 1
mother 1
requires 1
Do 1
you 1
smoke 1
Jack 1
Well 1
yes 1
I 1
must 1
admit 1
I 1
smoke 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
I 1
am 1
glad 1
to 1
hear 1
it 1
A 1
man 1
should 1
always 1
have 1
an 1
occupation 1
of 1
some 1
kind 1
There 1
are 1
far 1
too 1
many 1
idle 1
men 1
in 1
London 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
How 1
old 1
are 1
you 1
Jack 1
Twenty 1
nine 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
A 1
very 1
good 1
age 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
at 1
I 1
have 1
always 1
been 1
of 1
opinion 1
that 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
desires 1
to 1
get 1
married 1
should 1
know 1
either 1
everything 1
or 1
nothing 1
Which 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
Jack 1
After 1
some 1
hesitation 1
I 1
know 1
nothing 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
I 1
am 1
pleased 1
to 1
hear 1
it 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
approve 1
of 1
anything 1
that 1
tampers 1
with 1
natural 1
ignorance 1
Ignorance 1
is 1
like 1
a 1
delicate 1
exotic 1
fruit 1
touch 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
bloom 1
is 1
gone 1
The 1
whole 1
theory 1
of 1
modern 1
education 1
is 1
radically 1
unsound 1
Fortunately 1
in 1
England 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
education 1
produces 1
no 1
effect 1
whatsoever 1
If 1
it 1
did 1
it 1
would 1
prove 1
a 1
serious 1
danger 1
to 1
the 1
upper 1
classes 1
and 1
probably 1
lead 1
to 1
acts 1
of 1
violence 1
in 1
Grosvenor 1
Square 1
What 1
is 1
your 1
income 1

Between 1

and 1
eight 1
thousand 1

Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Makes 1
a 1
note 1
in 1
her 1
book 1
In 1
land 1
or 1
in 1
investments 1
Jack 1
In 1
investments 1
chiefly 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
That 1
is 1
satisfactory 1
What 1
between 1
the 1
duties 1
expected 1
of 1
one 1
during 1
one 1
s 1
lifetime 1
and 1
the 1
duties 1
exacted 1
from 1
one 1
after 1
one 1
s 1
death 1
land 1
has 1
ceased 1
to 1
be 1
either 1
a 1
profit 1
or 1
a 1
pleasure 1
It 1
gives 1
one 1
position 1
and 1
prevents 1
one 1
from 1
keeping 1
it 1
up 1
That 1
s 1
all 1
that 1
can 1
be 1
said 1
about 1
land 1
Jack 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
country 1
house 1
with 1
some 1
land 1
of 1
course 1
attached 1
to 1
it 1
about 1
fifteen 1
hundred 1
acres 1
I 1
believe 1
but 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
depend 1
on 1
that 1
for 1
my 1
real 1
income 1
In 1
fact 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
I 1
can 1
make 1
out 1
the 1
poachers 1
are 1
the 1
only 1
people 1
who 1
make 1
anything 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
A 1
country 1
house 1
How 1
many 1
bedrooms 1
Well 1
that 1
point 1
can 1
be 1
cleared 1
up 1
afterwards 1
You 1
have 1
a 1
town 1
house 1
I 1
hope 1
A 1
girl 1
with 1
a 1
simple 1
unspoiled 1
nature 1
like 1
Gwendolen 1
could 1
hardly 1
be 1
expected 1
to 1
reside 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
Jack 1
Well 1
I 1
own 1
a 1
house 1
in 1
Belgrave 1
Square 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
let 1
by 1
the 1
year 1
to 1
Lady 1
Bloxham 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
can 1
get 1
it 1
back 1
whenever 1
I 1
like 1
at 1
six 1
months 1
notice 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Lady 1
Bloxham 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
her 1
Jack 1
Oh 1
she 1
goes 1
about 1
very 1
little 1
She 1
is 1
a 1
lady 1
considerably 1
advanced 1
in 1
years 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Ah 1
nowadays 1
that 1
is 1
no 1
guarantee 1
of 1
respectability 1
of 1
character 1
What 1
number 1
in 1
Belgrave 1
Square 1
Jack 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Shaking 1
her 1
head 1
The 1
unfashionable 1
side 1
I 1
thought 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
However 1
that 1
could 1
easily 1
be 1
altered 1
Jack 1
Do 1
you 1
mean 1
the 1
fashion 1
or 1
the 1
side 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Sternly 1
Both 1
if 1
necessary 1
I 1
presume 1
What 1
are 1
your 1
politics 1
Jack 1
Well 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
I 1
really 1
have 1
none 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
Liberal 1
Unionist 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Oh 1
they 1
count 1
as 1
Tories 1
They 1
dine 1
with 1
us 1
Or 1
come 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
Now 1
to 1
minor 1
matters 1
Are 1
your 1
parents 1
living 1
Jack 1
I 1
have 1
lost 1
both 1
my 1
parents 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
To 1
lose 1
one 1
parent 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
may 1
be 1
regarded 1
as 1
a 1
misfortune 1
to 1
lose 1
both 1
looks 1
like 1
carelessness 1
Who 1
was 1
your 1
father 1
He 1
was 1
evidently 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
some 1
wealth 1
Was 1
he 1
born 1
in 1
what 1
the 1
Radical 1
papers 1
call 1
the 1
purple 1
of 1
commerce 1
or 1
did 1
he 1
rise 1
from 1
the 1
ranks 1
of 1
the 1
aristocracy 1
Jack 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
I 1
really 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
The 1
fact 1
is 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
I 1
said 1
I 1
had 1
lost 1
my 1
parents 1
It 1
would 1
be 1
nearer 1
the 1
truth 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
my 1
parents 1
seem 1
to 1
have 1
lost 1
me 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
actually 1
know 1
who 1
I 1
am 1
by 1
birth 1
I 1
was 1
well 1
I 1
was 1
found 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Found 1
Jack 1
The 1
late 1
Mr 1
Thomas 1
Cardew 1
an 1
old 1
gentleman 1
of 1
a 1
very 1
charitable 1
and 1
kindly 1
disposition 1
found 1
me 1
and 1
gave 1
me 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
Worthing 1
because 1
he 1
happened 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
first 1
class 1
ticket 1
for 1
Worthing 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
Worthing 1
is 1
a 1
place 1
in 1
Sussex 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
seaside 1
resort 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Where 1
did 1
the 1
charitable 1
gentleman 1
who 1
had 1
a 1
first 1
class 1
ticket 1
for 1
this 1
seaside 1
resort 1
find 1
you 1
Jack 1
Gravely 1
In 1
a 1
hand 1
bag 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
A 1
hand 1
bag 1
Jack 1
Very 1
seriously 1
Yes 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
hand 1
bag 1
a 1
somewhat 1
large 1
black 1
leather 1
hand 1
bag 1
with 1
handles 1
to 1
it 1
an 1
ordinary 1
hand 1
bag 1
in 1
fact 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
In 1
what 1
locality 1
did 1
this 1
Mr 1
James 1
or 1
Thomas 1
Cardew 1
come 1
across 1
this 1
ordinary 1
hand 1
bag 1
Jack 1
In 1
the 1
cloak 1
room 1
at 1
Victoria 1
Station 1
It 1
was 1
given 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
mistake 1
for 1
his 1
own 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
The 1
cloak 1
room 1
at 1
Victoria 1
Station 1
Jack 1
Yes 1
The 1
Brighton 1
line 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
The 1
line 1
is 1
immaterial 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
I 1
confess 1
I 1
feel 1
somewhat 1
bewildered 1
by 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
just 1
told 1
me 1
To 1
be 1
born 1
or 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
bred 1
in 1
a 1
hand 1
bag 1
whether 1
it 1
had 1
handles 1
or 1
not 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
display 1
a 1
contempt 1
for 1
the 1
ordinary 1
decencies 1
of 1
family 1
life 1
that 1
reminds 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
worst 1
excesses 1
of 1
the 1
French 1
Revolution 1
And 1
I 1
presume 1
you 1
know 1
what 1
that 1
unfortunate 1
movement 1
led 1
to 1
As 1
for 1
the 1
particular 1
locality 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
hand 1
bag 1
was 1
found 1
a 1
cloak 1
room 1
at 1
a 1
railway 1
station 1
might 1
serve 1
to 1
conceal 1
a 1
social 1
indiscretion 1
has 1
probably 1
indeed 1
been 1
used 1
for 1
that 1
purpose 1
before 1
now 1
but 1
it 1
could 1
hardly 1
be 1
regarded 1
as 1
an 1
assured 1
basis 1
for 1
a 1
recognised 1
position 1
in 1
good 1
society 1
Jack 1
May 1
I 1
ask 1
you 1
then 1
what 1
you 1
would 1
advise 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
I 1
need 1
hardly 1
say 1
I 1
would 1
do 1
anything 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
ensure 1
Gwendolen 1
s 1
happiness 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
I 1
would 1
strongly 1
advise 1
you 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
acquire 1
some 1
relations 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
possible 1
and 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
definite 1
effort 1
to 1
produce 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
one 1
parent 1
of 1
either 1
sex 1
before 1
the 1
season 1
is 1
quite 1
over 1
Jack 1
Well 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
see 1
how 1
I 1
could 1
possibly 1
manage 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
I 1
can 1
produce 1
the 1
hand 1
bag 1
at 1
any 1
moment 1
It 1
is 1
in 1
my 1
dressing 1
room 1
at 1
home 1
I 1
really 1
think 1
that 1
should 1
satisfy 1
you 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Me 1
sir 1
What 1
has 1
it 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
me 1
You 1
can 1
hardly 1
imagine 1
that 1
I 1
and 1
Lord 1
Bracknell 1
would 1
dream 1
of 1
allowing 1
our 1
only 1
daughter 1
a 1
girl 1
brought 1
up 1
with 1
the 1
utmost 1
care 1
to 1
marry 1
into 1
a 1
cloak 1
room 1
and 1
form 1
an 1
alliance 1
with 1
a 1
parcel 1
Good 1
morning 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
sweeps 1
out 1
in 1
majestic 1
indignation 1
Jack 1
Good 1
morning 1
Algernon 1
from 1
the 1
other 1
room 1
strikes 1
up 1
the 1
Wedding 1
March 1
Jack 1
looks 1
perfectly 1
furious 1
and 1
goes 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
For 1
goodness 1
sake 1
don 1
t 1
play 1
that 1
ghastly 1
tune 1
Algy 1
How 1
idiotic 1
you 1
are 1
The 1
music 1
stops 1
and 1
Algernon 1
enters 1
cheerily 1
Algernon 1
Didn 1
t 1
it 1
go 1
off 1
all 1
right 1
old 1
boy 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
mean 1
to 1
say 1
Gwendolen 1
refused 1
you 1
I 1
know 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
way 1
she 1
has 1
She 1
is 1
always 1
refusing 1
people 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
most 1
ill 1
natured 1
of 1
her 1
Jack 1
Oh 1
Gwendolen 1
is 1
as 1
right 1
as 1
a 1
trivet 1
As 1
far 1
as 1
she 1
is 1
concerned 1
we 1
are 1
engaged 1
Her 1
mother 1
is 1
perfectly 1
unbearable 1
Never 1
met 1
such 1
a 1
Gorgon 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
really 1
know 1
what 1
a 1
Gorgon 1
is 1
like 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
quite 1
sure 1
that 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
is 1
one 1
In 1
any 1
case 1
she 1
is 1
a 1
monster 1
without 1
being 1
a 1
myth 1
which 1
is 1
rather 1
unfair 1
I 1
beg 1
your 1
pardon 1
Algy 1
I 1
suppose 1
I 1
shouldn 1
t 1
talk 1
about 1
your 1
own 1
aunt 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
before 1
you 1
Algernon 1
My 1
dear 1
boy 1
I 1
love 1
hearing 1
my 1
relations 1
abused 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
that 1
makes 1
me 1
put 1
up 1
with 1
them 1
at 1
all 1
Relations 1
are 1
simply 1
a 1
tedious 1
pack 1
of 1
people 1
who 1
haven 1
t 1
got 1
the 1
remotest 1
knowledge 1
of 1
how 1
to 1
live 1
nor 1
the 1
smallest 1
instinct 1
about 1
when 1
to 1
die 1
Jack 1
Oh 1
that 1
is 1
nonsense 1
Algernon 1
It 1
isn 1
t 1
Jack 1
Well 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
argue 1
about 1
the 1
matter 1
You 1
always 1
want 1
to 1
argue 1
about 1
things 1
Algernon 1
That 1
is 1
exactly 1
what 1
things 1
were 1
originally 1
made 1
for 1
Jack 1
Upon 1
my 1
word 1
if 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
I 1
d 1
shoot 1
myself 1
A 1
pause 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
there 1
is 1
any 1
chance 1
of 1
Gwendolen 1
becoming 1
like 1
her 1
mother 1
in 1
about 1
a 1
hundred 1
and 1
fifty 1
years 1
do 1
you 1
Algy 1
Algernon 1
All 1
women 1
become 1
like 1
their 1
mothers 1
That 1
is 1
their 1
tragedy 1
No 1
man 1
does 1
That 1
s 1
his 1
Jack 1
Is 1
that 1
clever 1
Algernon 1
It 1
is 1
perfectly 1
phrased 1
and 1
quite 1
as 1
true 1
as 1
any 1
observation 1
in 1
civilised 1
life 1
should 1
be 1
Jack 1
I 1
am 1
sick 1
to 1
death 1
of 1
cleverness 1
Everybody 1
is 1
clever 1
nowadays 1
You 1
can 1
t 1
go 1
anywhere 1
without 1
meeting 1
clever 1
people 1
The 1
thing 1
has 1
become 1
an 1
absolute 1
public 1
nuisance 1
I 1
wish 1
to 1
goodness 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
few 1
fools 1
left 1
Algernon 1
We 1
have 1
Jack 1
I 1
should 1
extremely 1
like 1
to 1
meet 1
them 1
What 1
do 1
they 1
talk 1
about 1
Algernon 1
The 1
fools 1
Oh 1
about 1
the 1
clever 1
people 1
of 1
course 1
Jack 1
What 1
fools 1
Algernon 1
By 1
the 1
way 1
did 1
you 1
tell 1
Gwendolen 1
the 1
truth 1
about 1
your 1
being 1
Ernest 1
in 1
town 1
and 1
Jack 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
Jack 1
In 1
a 1
very 1
patronising 1
manner 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
the 1
truth 1
isn 1
t 1
quite 1
the 1
sort 1
of 1
thing 1
one 1
tells 1
to 1
a 1
nice 1
sweet 1
refined 1
girl 1
What 1
extraordinary 1
ideas 1
you 1
have 1
about 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
behave 1
to 1
a 1
woman 1
Algernon 1
The 1
only 1
way 1
to 1
behave 1
to 1
a 1
woman 1
is 1
to 1
make 1
love 1
to 1
her 1
if 1
she 1
is 1
pretty 1
and 1
to 1
some 1
one 1
else 1
if 1
she 1
is 1
plain 1
Jack 1
Oh 1
that 1
is 1
nonsense 1
Algernon 1
What 1
about 1
your 1
brother 1
What 1
about 1
the 1
profligate 1
Ernest 1
Jack 1
Oh 1
before 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
week 1
I 1
shall 1
have 1
got 1
rid 1
of 1
him 1
I 1
ll 1
say 1
he 1
died 1
in 1
Paris 1
of 1
apoplexy 1
Lots 1
of 1
people 1
die 1
of 1
apoplexy 1
quite 1
suddenly 1
don 1
t 1
they 1
Algernon 1
Yes 1
but 1
it 1
s 1
hereditary 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
It 1
s 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
thing 1
that 1
runs 1
in 1
families 1
You 1
had 1
much 1
better 1
say 1
a 1
severe 1
chill 1
Jack 1
You 1
are 1
sure 1
a 1
severe 1
chill 1
isn 1
t 1
hereditary 1
or 1
anything 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
Algernon 1
Of 1
course 1
it 1
isn 1
t 1
Jack 1
Very 1
well 1
then 1
My 1
poor 1
brother 1
Ernest 1
to 1
carried 1
off 1
suddenly 1
in 1
Paris 1
by 1
a 1
severe 1
chill 1
That 1
gets 1
rid 1
of 1
him 1
Algernon 1
But 1
I 1
thought 1
you 1
said 1
that 1
Miss 1
Cardew 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
much 1
interested 1
in 1
your 1
poor 1
brother 1
Ernest 1
Won 1
t 1
she 1
feel 1
his 1
loss 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
Jack 1
Oh 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
right 1
Cecily 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
silly 1
romantic 1
girl 1
I 1
am 1
glad 1
to 1
say 1
She 1
has 1
got 1
a 1
capital 1
appetite 1
goes 1
long 1
walks 1
and 1
pays 1
no 1
attention 1
at 1
all 1
to 1
her 1
lessons 1
Algernon 1
I 1
would 1
rather 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
Cecily 1
Jack 1
I 1
will 1
take 1
very 1
good 1
care 1
you 1
never 1
do 1
She 1
is 1
excessively 1
pretty 1
and 1
she 1
is 1
only 1
just 1
eighteen 1
Algernon 1
Have 1
you 1
told 1
Gwendolen 1
yet 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
an 1
excessively 1
pretty 1
ward 1
who 1
is 1
only 1
just 1
eighteen 1
Jack 1
Oh 1
one 1
doesn 1
t 1
blurt 1
these 1
things 1
out 1
to 1
people 1
Cecily 1
and 1
Gwendolen 1
are 1
perfectly 1
certain 1
to 1
be 1
extremely 1
great 1
friends 1
I 1
ll 1
bet 1
you 1
anything 1
you 1
like 1
that 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
after 1
they 1
have 1
met 1
they 1
will 1
be 1
calling 1
each 1
other 1
sister 1
Algernon 1
Women 1
only 1
do 1
that 1
when 1
they 1
have 1
called 1
each 1
other 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
other 1
things 1
first 1
Now 1

we 1
want 1

get 1

Irritably 1
Oh 1
It 1

seven 1
Algernon 1
Well 1
I 1
m 1
hungry 1
Jack 1
I 1
never 1
knew 1
you 1
when 1
you 1
weren 1
t 1
Algernon 1
What 1
shall 1
we 1
do 1
after 1
dinner 1
Go 1
to 1
a 1
theatre 1
Jack 1
Oh 1
no 1
I 1
loathe 1
listening 1
Algernon 1
Well 1
let 1
us 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
Club 1
Jack 1
Oh 1
no 1
I 1
hate 1
talking 1
Algernon 1
Well 1
we 1
might 1
trot 1
round 1
to 1
the 1
Empire 1

ten 1
Jack 1
Oh 1
no 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
bear 1
looking 1
at 1
things 1
It 1
is 1
so 1
silly 1
Algernon 1
Well 1
what 1
shall 1
we 1
do 1
Jack 1
Nothing 1
Algernon 1
It 1
is 1
awfully 1
hard 1
work 1
doing 1
nothing 1
However 1
I 1
don 1
t 1

hard 1
work 1
where 1
there 1
is 1

definite 1

Gwendolen 1
upon 1
my 1
word 1
Gwendolen 1
Algy 1
kindly 1
turn 1
your 1
back 1
I 1
have 1
something 1
very 1
particular 1
to 1
say 1
to 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
Algernon 1
Really 1
Gwendolen 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
I 1
can 1
allow 1
this 1
at 1
all 1
Gwendolen 1
Algy 1
you 1
always 1
adopt 1
a 1
strictly 1
immoral 1
attitude 1
towards 1
life 1
You 1
are 1
not 1
quite 1
old 1
enough 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
Algernon 1
retires 1

the 1
fireplace 1
Jack 1
My 1
own 1
darling 1
Gwendolen 1
Ernest 1
we 1
may 1
never 1
be 1
married 1
From 1
the 1
expression 1
on 1
mamma 1
s 1
face 1
I 1
fear 1
we 1
never 1
shall 1
Few 1
parents 1
nowadays 1
pay 1
any 1
regard 1
to 1
what 1
their 1
children 1
say 1
to 1
them 1
The 1
old 1
fashioned 1
respect 1
for 1
the 1
young 1
is 1
fast 1
dying 1
out 1
Whatever 1
influence 1
I 1
ever 1
had 1
over 1
mamma 1
I 1
lost 1
at 1
the 1
age 1
of 1
three 1
But 1
although 1
she 1
may 1
prevent 1
us 1
from 1
becoming 1
man 1
and 1
wife 1
and 1
I 1
may 1
marry 1
some 1
one 1
else 1
and 1
marry 1
often 1
nothing 1
that 1
she 1
can 1
possibly 1
do 1
can 1
alter 1
my 1
eternal 1
devotion 1
to 1
you 1
Jack 1
Dear 1
Gwendolen 2
The 1
story 1
of 1
your 1
romantic 1
origin 1
as 1
related 1
to 1
me 1
by 1
mamma 1
with 1
unpleasing 1
comments 1
has 1
naturally 1
stirred 1
the 1
deeper 1
fibres 1
of 1
my 1
nature 1
Your 1
Christian 1
name 1
has 1
an 1
irresistible 1
fascination 1
The 1
simplicity 1
of 1
your 1
character 1
makes 1
you 1
exquisitely 1
incomprehensible 1
to 1
me 1
Your 1
town 1
address 1
at 1

I 1

It 1
may 1
be 1
necessary 1
to 1
do 1
something 1
desperate 1
That 1
of 1
course 1
will 1
require 1
serious 1
consideration 1
I 1
will 1
communicate 1
with 1
you 1
daily 1

My 1

Calling 1
Cecily 2
Surely 1
such 1
a 1
utilitarian 1
occupation 1
as 1
the 1
watering 1
of 1

is 1
rather 1
Moulton 1

duty 1
than 1
yours 1

at 1

Coming 1
over 1
very 1
slowly 1
But 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
German 1
It 1
isn 1
t 1
at 1
all 1
a 1
becoming 1
language 1
I 1
know 1
perfectly 1
well 1
that 1
I 1
look 1
quite 1
plain 1
after 1
my 1
German 1
lesson 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
Child 1
you 1
know 1
how 1
anxious 1
your 1
guardian 1
is 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
improve 1
yourself 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
He 1
laid 1
particular 1
stress 1
on 1
your 1
German 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
leaving 1
for 1
town 1
yesterday 1
Indeed 1
he 1
always 1
lays 1
stress 1
on 1
your 1
German 1
when 1
he 1
is 1
leaving 1
for 1
town 1
Cecily 1
Dear 1
Uncle 1
Jack 1
is 1
so 1
very 1
serious 1
Sometimes 1
he 1
is 1
so 1
serious 1
that 1
I 1
think 1
he 1
cannot 1
be 1
quite 1
well 1
Miss 1

Drawing 1

Your 1
guardian 1
enjoys 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
health 1
and 1
his 1
gravity 1
of 1
demeanour 1
is 1
especially 1
to 1
be 1
commended 1
in 1
one 1
so 1
comparatively 1
young 1
as 1
he 1
is 1
I 1
know 1
no 1
one 1
who 1
has 1
a 1
higher 1
sense 1
of 1
duty 1
and 1
responsibility 1
Cecily 1
I 1
suppose 1
that 1
is 1
why 1
he 1
often 1
looks 1
a 1
little 1
bored 1
when 1
we 1
three 1
are 1
together 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
Cecily 1
I 1
am 1
surprised 1
at 1
you 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
has 1
many 1
troubles 1
in 1
his 1
life 1
Idle 1
merriment 1
and 1
triviality 1
would 1
be 1
out 1
of 1
place 1
in 1
his 1
conversation 1
You 1
must 1
remember 1
his 1
constant 1
anxiety 1
about 1
that 1
unfortunate 1
young 1
man 1
his 1
brother 1
Cecily 1
I 1
wish 1
Uncle 1
Jack 1
would 1
allow 1
that 1
unfortunate 1
young 1
man 1
his 1
brother 1
to 1
come 1
down 1
here 1
sometimes 1
We 1
might 1
have 1
a 1
good 1
influence 1
over 1
him 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
you 1
certainly 1
would 1
You 1
know 1
German 1
and 1
geology 1
and 1
things 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
influence 1
a 1
man 1
very 1
much 1
Cecily 1
begins 1
to 1
write 1
in 1
her 1
diary 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
Shaking 1
her 1
head 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
even 1
I 1
could 1
produce 1
any 1
effect 1
on 1
a 1
character 1
that 1
according 1
to 1
his 1
own 1
brother 1
s 1
admission 1
is 1
irretrievably 1
weak 1
and 1
vacillating 1
Indeed 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
sure 1
that 1
I 1
would 1
desire 1
to 1
reclaim 1
him 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
this 1
modern 1
mania 1
for 1
turning 1
bad 1
people 1
into 1
good 1

You 1
must 1
put 1
away 1
your 1
diary 1
Cecily 1
I 1
really 1
don 1
t 1
see 1
why 1
you 1
should 1
keep 1
a 1
diary 1
at 1
all 1
Cecily 1
I 1
keep 1
a 1
diary 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
enter 1
the 1
wonderful 1
secrets 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
If 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
write 1
them 1
down 1
I 1
should 1
probably 1
forget 1
all 1
about 1
them 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
Memory 1
my 1
dear 1
Cecily 1
is 1
the 1
diary 1
that 1
we 1
all 1
carry 1
about 1
with 1
us 1
Cecily 1
Yes 1
but 1
it 1
usually 1
chronicles 1
the 1
things 1
that 1
have 1
never 1
happened 1
and 1
couldn 1
t 1
possibly 1
have 1
happened 1
I 1
believe 1
that 1
Memory 1
is 1
responsible 1
for 1
nearly 1
all 1
the 1
three 1
volume 1
novels 1
that 1
Mudie 1
sends 1
us 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
Do 1
not 1
speak 1
slightingly 1
of 1
the 1
three 1
volume 1
novel 1
Cecily 1
I 1
wrote 1
one 1
myself 1
in 1
earlier 1
days 1
Cecily 1
Did 1
you 1
really 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
How 1
wonderfully 1
clever 1
you 1
are 1
I 1
hope 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
end 1
happily 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
novels 1
that 1
end 1
happily 1
They 1
depress 1
me 1
so 1
much 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
The 1
good 1
ended 1
happily 1
and 1
the 1
bad 1
unhappily 1
That 1
is 1
what 1
Fiction 1
means 1
Cecily 1
I 1
suppose 1
so 1
But 1
it 1
seems 1
very 1
unfair 1
And 1
was 1
your 1
novel 1
ever 1
published 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
Alas 1
no 1
The 1
manuscript 1
unfortunately 1
was 1
abandoned 1
Cecily 1
starts 1
I 1
use 1
the 1
word 1
in 1
the 1
sense 1
of 1
lost 1
or 1
mislaid 1
To 1
your 1
work 1
child 1
these 1
speculations 1
are 1
profitless 1
Cecily 1
Smiling 1
But 1
I 1
see 1
dear 1
Dr 1
Chasuble 1
coming 1
up 1
through 1
the 1
garden 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
Rising 1
and 1
advancing 1
Dr 1
Chasuble 1
This 1
is 1
indeed 1
a 1
pleasure 1
Enter 1
Canon 1
Chasuble 2
And 1
how 1
are 1
we 1
this 1
morning 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
you 1
are 1
I 1
trust 1
well 1
Cecily 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
has 1
just 1
been 1
complaining 1
of 1
a 1
slight 1
headache 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
would 1
do 1
her 1
so 1
much 1
good 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
short 1
stroll 1
with 1
you 1
in 1
the 1
Park 1
Dr 1
Chasuble 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
Cecily 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
mentioned 1
anything 1
about 1
a 1
headache 1
Cecily 1
No 1
dear 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
but 1
I 1
felt 1
instinctively 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
a 1
headache 1
Indeed 1
I 1
was 1
thinking 1
about 1
that 1
and 1
not 1
about 1
my 1
German 1
lesson 1
when 1
the 1
Rector 1
came 1
in 1
Chasuble 1
I 1
hope 1
Cecily 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
inattentive 1
Cecily 1
Oh 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
I 1
am 1
Chasuble 1
That 1
is 1
strange 1
Were 1
I 1
fortunate 1
enough 1
to 1
be 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
s 1
pupil 1
I 1
would 1
hang 1
upon 1
her 1
lips 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
glares 1
I 1
spoke 1
metaphorically 1
My 1
metaphor 1
was 1
drawn 1
from 1
bees 1
Ahem 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
I 1
suppose 1
has 1
not 1
returned 1
from 1
town 1
yet 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
We 1
do 1
not 1
expect 1
him 1
till 1
Monday 1
afternoon 1
Chasuble 1
Ah 1
yes 1
he 1
usually 1
likes 1
to 1
spend 1
his 1
Sunday 1
in 1
London 1
He 1
is 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
whose 1
sole 1
aim 1
is 1
enjoyment 1
as 1
by 1
all 1
accounts 1
that 1
unfortunate 1
young 1
man 1
his 1
brother 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
But 1
I 1
must 1
not 1
disturb 1
Egeria 1
and 1
her 1
pupil 1
any 1
longer 1

both 1
no 1

at 1
Evensong 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
I 1
think 1
dear 1
Doctor 1
I 1
will 1
have 1
a 1
stroll 1
with 1
you 1
I 1
find 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
headache 1
after 1
all 1
and 1
a 1
walk 1
might 1
do 1
it 1
good 1
Chasuble 1
With 1
pleasure 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
with 1
pleasure 1
We 1
might 1
go 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
the 1
schools 1
and 1
back 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
That 1
would 1
be 1
delightful 1
Cecily 1
you 1
will 1
read 1
your 1

absence 1
The 1

on 1
the 1

somewhat 1
too 1

these 1

their 1
melodramatic 1

Mr 1

driven 1
over 1

The 1

Uncle 1
Jack 1
s 1
brother 1
Did 1
you 1
tell 1
him 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
was 1
in 1
town 1
Merriman 1
Yes 1
Miss 1
He 1
seemed 1
very 1
much 1
disappointed 1
I 1
mentioned 1
that 1
you 1
and 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
He 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
anxious 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
you 1
privately 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
Cecily 1
Ask 1
Mr 1
Ernest 1
Worthing 1
to 1
come 1
here 1
I 1
suppose 1
you 1
had 1
better 1
talk 1
to 1
the 1
housekeeper 1
about 1
a 1
room 1
for 1
him 1
Merriman 1
Yes 1
Miss 1
Merriman 1
goes 1
off 1
Cecily 1
I 1
have 1
never 1
met 1
any 1
really 1
wicked 1
person 1
before 1
I 1
feel 1
rather 1
frightened 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
afraid 1
he 1
will 1
look 1
just 1
like 1
every 1
one 1
else 1
Enter 1
Algernon 1
very 1
gay 1
and 1
debonnair 1
He 1
does 1
Algernon 1
Raising 1
his 1
hat 1
You 1
are 1
my 1
little 1
cousin 1
Cecily 1
I 1
m 1
sure 1
Cecily 1
You 1
are 1
under 1
some 1
strange 1
mistake 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
little 1
In 1
fact 1
I 1
believe 1
I 1
am 1
more 1
than 1
usually 1
tall 1
for 1
my 1
age 1
Algernon 1
is 1
rather 1
taken 1
aback 1
But 1
I 1
am 1
your 1
cousin 1
Cecily 1
You 1
I 1
see 1
from 1
your 1
card 1
are 1
Uncle 1
Jack 1
s 1
brother 1
my 1
cousin 1
Ernest 1
my 1
wicked 1
cousin 1
Ernest 1
Algernon 1
Oh 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
really 1
wicked 1
at 1
all 1
cousin 1
Cecily 1
You 1
mustn 1
t 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
wicked 1
Cecily 1
If 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
then 1
you 1
have 1
certainly 1
been 1
deceiving 1
us 1
all 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
inexcusable 1
manner 1
I 1
hope 1
you 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
leading 1
a 1
double 1
life 1
pretending 1
to 1
be 1
wicked 1
and 1
being 1
really 1
good 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
That 1
would 1
be 1
hypocrisy 1
Algernon 1
Looks 1
at 1
her 1
in 1
amazement 1
Oh 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
rather 1
reckless 1
Cecily 1
I 1
am 1
glad 1
to 1
hear 1
it 1
Algernon 1
In 1
fact 1
now 1
you 1
mention 1
the 1
subject 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
very 1
bad 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
small 1
way 1
Cecily 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
you 1
should 1
be 1
so 1
proud 1
of 1
that 1
though 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
very 1
pleasant 1
Algernon 1
It 1
is 1
much 1
pleasanter 1
being 1
here 1
with 1
you 1
Cecily 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
understand 1
how 1
you 1
are 1
here 1
at 1
all 1
Uncle 1
Jack 1
won 1
t 1
be 1
back 1
till 1
Monday 1
afternoon 1
Algernon 1
That 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
disappointment 1
I 1
am 1
obliged 1
to 1
go 1
up 1
by 1
the 1
first 1
train 1
on 1
Monday 1
morning 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
business 1
appointment 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
anxious 1
to 1
miss 1
Cecily 1
Couldn 1
t 1
you 1
miss 1
it 1
anywhere 1
but 1
in 1
London 1
Algernon 1
No 1
the 1
appointment 1
is 1
in 1
London 1
Cecily 1
Well 1
I 1
know 1
of 1
course 1
how 1
important 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
to 1
keep 1
a 1
business 1
engagement 1
if 1
one 1
wants 1
to 1
retain 1
any 1
sense 1
of 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
life 1
but 1
still 1
I 1
think 1
you 1
had 1
better 1
wait 1
till 1
Uncle 1
Jack 1
arrives 1
I 1
know 1
he 1
wants 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
you 1
about 1
your 1
emigrating 1
Algernon 1
About 1
my 1
what 1
Cecily 1
Your 1
emigrating 1
He 1
has 1
gone 1
up 1
to 1
buy 1
your 1
outfit 1
Algernon 1
I 1
certainly 1
wouldn 1
t 1
let 1
Jack 1
buy 1
my 1
outfit 1
He 1
has 1
no 1
taste 1
in 1
neckties 1
at 1
all 1
Cecily 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
you 1
will 1
require 1
neckties 1
Uncle 1
Jack 1
is 1
sending 1
you 1
to 1
Australia 1
Algernon 1
Australia 1
I 1
d 1
sooner 1
die 1
Cecily 1
Well 1
he 1
said 1
at 1
dinner 1
on 1
Wednesday 1
night 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
choose 1
between 1
this 1
world 1
the 1
next 1
world 1
and 1
Australia 1
Algernon 1
Oh 1
well 1
The 1
accounts 1
I 1
have 1
received 1
of 1
Australia 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
world 1
are 1
not 1
particularly 1
encouraging 1
This 1
world 1
is 1
good 1
enough 1
for 1
me 1
cousin 1
Cecily 2
Yes 1
but 1
are 1
you 1
good 1
enough 1
for 1
it 1
Algernon 1
I 1
m 1
afraid 1
I 1
m 1
not 1
that 1
That 1
is 1
why 1
I 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
reform 1
me 1
You 1
might 1
make 1
that 1
your 1
mission 1
if 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
mind 1
cousin 1
Cecily 2
I 1
m 1
afraid 1
I 1
ve 1
no 1
time 1
this 1
afternoon 1
Algernon 1
Well 1
would 1
you 1
mind 1
my 1
reforming 1
myself 1
this 1
afternoon 1
Cecily 1
It 1
is 1
rather 1
Quixotic 1
of 1
you 1
But 1
I 1
think 1
you 1
should 1
try 1
Algernon 1
I 1
will 1
I 1
feel 1
better 1
already 1
Cecily 1
You 1
are 1
looking 1
a 1
little 1
worse 1
Algernon 1
That 1
is 1
because 1
I 1
am 1
hungry 1
Cecily 1
How 1
thoughtless 1
of 1
me 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
remembered 1
that 1
when 1
one 1
is 1
going 1
to 1
lead 1
an 1
entirely 1
new 1
life 1
one 1
requires 1
regular 1
and 1
wholesome 1
meals 1
Won 1
t 1
you 1
come 1
in 1
Algernon 1
Thank 1
you 1
Might 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
buttonhole 1
first 1
I 1
never 1
have 1
any 1
appetite 1
unless 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
buttonhole 1
first 1
Cecily 1
A 1
Marechal 1
Niel 1
Picks 1
up 1
scissors 1
Algernon 1
No 1
I 1
d 1
sooner 1
have 1
a 1
pink 1
rose 1
Cecily 1
Why 1
Cuts 1
a 1
flower 1
Algernon 1
Because 1
you 1
are 1
like 1
a 1
pink 1
rose 1
Cousin 1
Cecily 2
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
it 1
can 1
be 1
right 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
me 1
like 1
that 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
never 1
says 1
such 1
things 1
to 1
me 1
Algernon 1
Then 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
is 1
a 1
short 1
sighted 1
old 1
lady 1
Cecily 1
puts 1
the 1
rose 1
in 1
his 1
buttonhole 1
You 1
are 1
the 1
prettiest 1
girl 1
I 1
ever 1
saw 1
Cecily 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
says 1
that 1
all 1
good 1
looks 1
are 1
a 1
snare 1
Algernon 1
They 1
are 1
a 1
snare 1
that 1
every 1
sensible 1
man 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
be 1
caught 1
in 1
Cecily 1
Oh 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
I 1
would 1
care 1
to 1
catch 1
a 1
sensible 1
man 1
I 1
shouldn 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
him 1
about 1
They 1
pass 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
and 1
Dr 1
Chasuble 1
return 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
You 1
are 1
too 1
much 1
alone 1
dear 1
Dr 1
Chasuble 1
You 1
should 1
get 1
married 1
A 1
misanthrope 1
I 1
can 1
understand 1
a 1
womanthrope 1
never 1
Chasuble 1
With 1
a 1
scholar 1
s 1
shudder 1
Believe 1
me 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
deserve 1
so 1
neologistic 1
a 1
phrase 1
The 1
precept 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
the 1
practice 1
of 1
the 1
Primitive 1
Church 1
was 1
distinctly 1
against 1
matrimony 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
Sententiously 1
That 1
is 1
obviously 1
the 1
reason 1
why 1
the 1
Primitive 1
Church 1
has 1
not 1
lasted 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
present 1
day 1
And 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
realise 1
dear 1
Doctor 1
that 1
by 1
persistently 1
remaining 1
single 1
a 1
man 1
converts 1
himself 1
into 1
a 1
permanent 1
public 1
temptation 1
Men 1
should 1
be 1
more 1
careful 1
this 1
very 1
celibacy 1
leads 1
weaker 1
vessels 1
astray 1
Chasuble 1
But 1
is 1
a 1
man 1
not 1
equally 1
attractive 1
when 1
married 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
No 1
married 1
man 1
is 1
ever 1
attractive 1
except 1
to 1
his 1

I 1

horticulturally 1
My 1

drawn 1
from 1

where 1

Perhaps 1
she 1

Enter 1
Jack 1
slowly 1
from 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
garden 1
He 1
is 1
dressed 1
in 1
the 1
deepest 1
mourning 1
with 1
crape 1

and 1
black 1

Mr 1
Worthing 1
Miss 1

This 1
is 1
indeed 1
a 1
surprise 1
We 1
did 1
not 1
look 1
for 1
you 1
till 1
Monday 1
afternoon 1

Miss 1

a 1
tragic 1
manner 1
I 1
have 1
returned 1
sooner 1
than 1
I 1
expected 1
Dr 1
Chasuble 1
I 1
hope 1
you 1
are 1
well 1
Chasuble 1
Dear 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
I 1
trust 1
this 1
garb 1
of 1
woe 1
does 1
not 1
betoken 1
some 1
terrible 1
calamity 1
Jack 1
My 1

Your 1

Jack 1
Quite 1
dead 1
Miss 1

What 1
a 1
lesson 1
for 1
him 1
I 1
trust 1
he 1
will 1
profit 1
by 1
it 1
Chasuble 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
I 1
offer 1
you 1
my 1
sincere 1
condolence 1
You 1
have 1
at 1
least 1
the 1
consolation 1
of 1
knowing 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
always 1
the 1
most 1
generous 1
and 1
forgiving 1
of 1
brothers 1
Jack 1
Poor 1
Ernest 1
He 1
had 1
many 1
faults 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
sad 2
blow 1
Chasuble 1
Very 1
sad 1
indeed 1
Were 1
you 1
with 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
Jack 1
No 1
He 1
died 1
abroad 1
in 1
Paris 1
in 1
fact 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
telegram 1
last 1
night 1
from 1
the 1
manager 1
of 1
the 1
Grand 1
Hotel 1
Chasuble 1
Was 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
death 1
mentioned 1
Jack 1
A 1
severe 1
chill 1
it 1
seems 1
Miss 1

As 1
a 1
man 1

Will 1
the 1
interment 1
take 1
place 1
here 1
Jack 1
No 1
He 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
expressed 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
be 1
buried 1
in 1
Paris 1

In 1
Paris 1
Shakes 1
his 1

I 1
fear 1
that 1
hardly 1
points 1
to 1
any 1
very 1
serious 1
state 1
of 1
mind 1
at 1
the 1
last 1
You 1
would 1
no 1
doubt 1
wish 1
me 1
to 1
make 1
some 1
slight 1
allusion 1
to 1
this 1
tragic 1
domestic 1
affliction 1
next 1
Sunday 1
Jack 1
presses 1
his 1
hand 1
convulsively 1
My 1
sermon 1
on 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
the 1
manna 1
in 1
the 1
wilderness 1
can 1
be 1
adapted 1
to 1
almost 1
any 1
occasion 1
joyful 1
or 1
as 1
in 1
the 1
present 1
case 1
distressing 1
All 1
sigh 1
I 1
have 1
preached 1
it 1
at 1
harvest 1
celebrations 1
christenings 1
confirmations 1
on 1
days 1
of 1
humiliation 1
and 1
festal 1
days 1
The 1
last 1
time 1
I 1
delivered 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
Cathedral 1
as 1
a 1
charity 1
sermon 1
on 1
behalf 1
of 1
the 1
Society 1
for 1
the 1
Prevention 1
of 1
Discontent 1
among 1
the 1
Upper 1
Orders 1
The 1
Bishop 1
who 1
was 1
present 1
was 1
much 1
struck 1
by 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
analogies 1
I 1
drew 1
Jack 1
Ah 1
that 1
reminds 1
me 1
you 1
mentioned 1
christenings 1
I 1
think 1
Dr 1
Chasuble 1
I 1
suppose 1
you 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
christen 1
all 1
right 1
Dr 1
Chasuble 1
looks 1
astounded 1
I 1
mean 1
of 1
course 1
you 1
are 1
continually 1
christening 1
aren 1
t 1
you 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
It 1
is 1
I 1
regret 1
to 1
say 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
Rector 1
s 1
most 1
constant 1
duties 1
in 1
this 1
parish 1
I 1
have 1
often 1
spoken 1
to 1
the 1
poorer 1
classes 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
But 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
thrift 1
is 1
Chasuble 1
But 1
is 1
there 1
any 1
particular 1
infant 1
in 1
whom 1
you 1
are 1
interested 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
Your 1
brother 1
was 1
I 1
believe 1
unmarried 1
was 1
he 1
not 1
Jack 1
Oh 1
yes 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
Bitterly 1
People 1
who 1
live 1
entirely 1
for 1
pleasure 1
usually 1
are 1
Jack 1
But 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
for 1
any 1
child 1
dear 1
Doctor 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
children 1
No 1
the 1
fact 1
is 1
I 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
be 1
christened 1
myself 1
this 1
afternoon 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
nothing 1
better 1
to 1
do 1
Chasuble 1
But 1
surely 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
christened 1
already 1
Jack 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
remember 1
anything 1
about 1
it 1
Chasuble 1
But 1
have 1
you 1
any 1
grave 1
doubts 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
Jack 1
I 1
certainly 1
intend 1
to 1
have 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
if 1
the 1
thing 1
would 1
bother 1
you 1
in 1
any 1
way 1
or 1
if 1
you 1
think 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
old 1
now 1
Chasuble 1
Not 1
at 1
all 1
The 1
sprinkling 1
and 1
indeed 1
the 1
immersion 1
of 1
adults 1
is 1
a 1
perfectly 1
canonical 1
practice 1
Jack 1
Immersion 1
Chasuble 1
You 1
need 1
have 1
no 1
apprehensions 1
Sprinkling 1
is 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
necessary 1
or 1
indeed 1
I 1
think 1
advisable 1
Our 1
weather 1
is 1
so 1
changeable 1
At 1
what 1
hour 1
would 1
you 1
wish 1
the 1
ceremony 1
performed 1
Jack 1
Oh 1
I 1
might 1
trot 1
round 1
about 1
five 1
if 1
that 1
would 1
suit 1
you 1
Chasuble 1
Perfectly 1
perfectly 1
In 1
fact 1
I 1
have 1
two 1
similar 1
ceremonies 1
to 1
perform 1
at 1
that 1
time 1
A 1
case 1
of 1
twins 1
that 1
occurred 1
recently 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
outlying 1
cottages 1
on 1
your 1
own 1
estate 1
Poor 1
Jenkins 1
the 1
carter 1
a 1
most 1
hard 1
working 1
man 1
Jack 1
Oh 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
see 1
much 1
fun 1
in 1
being 1
christened 1
along 1
with 1
other 1
babies 1
It 1
would 1
be 1
childish 1
Would 1
half 1
past 1
five 1
do 1
Chasuble 1
Admirably 2
Takes 1
out 1
watch 1
And 1
now 1
dear 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
intrude 1
any 1
longer 1
into 1
a 1
house 1
of 1
sorrow 1
I 1
would 1
merely 1
beg 1
you 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
too 1
much 1
bowed 1
down 1
by 1
grief 1
What 1
seem 1
to 1
us 1
bitter 1
trials 1
are 1
often 1
blessings 1
in 1
disguise 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
This 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
blessing 1
of 1
an 1
extremely 1
obvious 1
kind 1
Enter 1
Cecily 1
from 1
the 1
house 1
Cecily 1
Uncle 1
Jack 1
Oh 1
I 1
am 1
pleased 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
back 1
But 1
what 1
horrid 1
clothes 1
you 1
have 1
got 1
on 1
Do 1
go 1
and 1
change 1
them 1

child 1
Cecily 1
goes 1
towards 1
Jack 1
he 1
kisses 1
her 1
brow 1
in 1
a 1
melancholy 1
manner 1
Cecily 1
What 1
is 1
the 1
matter 1
Uncle 1
Jack 1
Do 1
look 1
happy 1
You 1
look 1
as 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
toothache 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
got 1
such 1
a 1
surprise 1
for 1
you 1
Who 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
dining 1
room 1
Your 1
brother 1
Jack 1
Who 1
Cecily 1
Your 1
brother 1
Ernest 1
He 1
arrived 1
about 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
ago 1
Jack 1
What 1
nonsense 1
I 1
haven 1
t 1
got 1
a 1
brother 1
Cecily 1
Oh 1
don 1
t 1
say 1
that 1
However 1
badly 1
he 1
may 1
have 1
behaved 1
to 1
you 1
in 1
the 1
past 1
he 1
is 1
still 1
your 1
brother 1
You 1
couldn 1
t 1
be 1
so 1
heartless 1
as 1
to 1
disown 1
him 1
I 1
ll 1
tell 1
him 1
to 1
come 1
out 1
And 1
you 1
will 1
shake 1
hands 1
with 1
him 1
won 1
t 1
you 1
Uncle 1
Jack 1
Runs 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
Chasuble 1
These 1
are 1
very 1
joyful 1
tidings 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
After 1
we 1
had 1
all 1
been 1
resigned 1
to 1
his 1
loss 1
his 1
sudden 1
return 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
peculiarly 1
distressing 1
Jack 1
My 1
brother 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
dining 1
room 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
it 1
all 1
means 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
perfectly 1
absurd 1
Enter 1
Algernon 1
and 1
Cecily 1
hand 1
in 1
hand 1
They 1
come 1
slowly 1
up 1
to 1
Jack 2
Good 1
heavens 1
Motions 1
Algernon 1
away 1
Algernon 1
Brother 1
John 1
I 1
have 1
come 1
down 1
from 1
town 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
sorry 1
for 1
all 1
the 1
trouble 1
I 1
have 1
given 1
you 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
intend 1
to 1
lead 1
a 1
better 1
life 1
in 1
the 1
future 1
Jack 1
glares 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
does 1
not 1
take 1
his 1
hand 1
Cecily 1
Uncle 1
Jack 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
refuse 1
your 1
own 1
brother 1
s 1
hand 1
Jack 1
Nothing 1
will 1
induce 1
me 1
to 1
take 1
his 1
hand 1
I 1
think 1
his 1
coming 1
down 1
here 1
disgraceful 1
He 1
knows 1
perfectly 1
well 1
why 1
Cecily 1
Uncle 1
Jack 1
do 1
be 1
nice 1
There 1
is 1
some 1
good 1
in 1
every 1
one 1
Ernest 1
has 1
just 1
been 1
telling 1
me 1
about 1
his 1
poor 1
invalid 1
friend 1
Mr 1
Bunbury 1
whom 1
he 1
goes 1
to 1
visit 1
so 1
often 1
And 1
surely 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
much 1
good 1
in 1
one 1
who 1
is 1
kind 1
to 1
an 1
invalid 1
and 1
leaves 1
the 1
pleasures 1
of 1
London 1
to 1
sit 1
by 1
a 1
bed 1
of 1
pain 1
Jack 1
Oh 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
talking 1
about 1
Bunbury 1
has 1
he 1
Cecily 1
Yes 1
he 1
has 1
told 1
me 1
all 1
about 1
poor 1
Mr 1
Bunbury 1
and 1
his 1
terrible 1
state 1
of 1
health 1
Jack 1
Bunbury 1
Well 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
have 1
him 1
talk 1
to 1
you 1
about 1
Bunbury 1
or 1
about 1
anything 1
else 1
It 1
is 1
enough 1
to 1
drive 1
one 1
perfectly 1
frantic 1
Algernon 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
admit 1
that 1
the 1
faults 1
were 1
all 1
on 1
my 1
side 1
But 1
I 1
must 1
say 1
that 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
Brother 1
John 1
s 1
coldness 1
to 1
me 1
is 1
peculiarly 1
painful 1
I 1
expected 1
a 1
more 1
enthusiastic 1
welcome 1
especially 1
considering 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
I 1
have 1
come 1
here 1
Cecily 1
Uncle 1
Jack 1
if 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
shake 1
hands 1
with 1
Ernest 1
I 1
will 1
never 1
forgive 1
you 1
Jack 1
Never 1
forgive 1
me 1
Cecily 1
Never 1
never 2
Jack 1
Well 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
last 1
time 1
I 1
shall 1
ever 1
do 1
it 1
Shakes 1
with 1
Algernon 1
and 1
glares 1
Chasuble 1
It 1
s 1
pleasant 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
to 1
see 1
so 1
perfect 1
a 1
reconciliation 1
I 1
think 1
we 1
might 1
leave 1
the 1
two 1
brothers 1
together 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
Cecily 1
you 1
will 1
come 1
with 1
us 1
Cecily 1
Certainly 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
My 1
little 1
task 1
of 1
reconciliation 1
is 1
over 1
Chasuble 1
You 1
have 1
done 1
a 1
beautiful 1
action 1
to 1
day 1
dear 1
child 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
We 1
must 1
not 1
be 1
premature 1
in 1
our 1
judgments 1
Cecily 1
I 1
feel 1
very 1
happy 1
They 1
all 1
go 1
off 1
except 1
Jack 1
and 1
Algernon 1
Jack 1
You 1
young 1
scoundrel 1
Algy 1
you 1
must 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
place 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
possible 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
allow 1
any 1

my 1
pleasures 1
in 1
the 1
smallest 1
degree 1
Jack 1
I 1
can 1
quite 1
understand 1
that 1
Algernon 1
Well 1
Cecily 1
is 1
a 1
darling 1
Jack 1
You 1
are 1
not 1
to 1
talk 1
of 1
Miss 1
Cardew 1
like 1
that 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
it 1
Algernon 1
Well 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
your 1
clothes 1
You 1
look 1
perfectly 1
ridiculous 1
in 1
them 1
Why 1
on 1
earth 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
go 1
up 1
and 1
change 1
It 1
is 1
perfectly 1
childish 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
deep 1
mourning 1
for 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
actually 1
staying 1
for 1
a 1
whole 1
week 1
with 1
you 1
in 1
your 1
house 1
as 1
a 1
guest 1
I 1
call 1
it 1
grotesque 1
Jack 1
You 1
are 1
certainly 1
not 1
staying 1
with 1
me 1
for 1
a 1
whole 1
week 1
as 1
a 1
guest 1
or 1
anything 1
else 1
You 1
have 1
got 1
to 1
leave 1
by 1
the 1
four 1
five 1
train 1
Algernon 1
I 1
certainly 1
won 1
t 1
leave 1
you 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
in 1
mourning 1
It 1
would 1
be 1
most 1
unfriendly 1
If 1
I 1
were 1
in 1
mourning 1
you 1
would 1
stay 1
with 1
me 1
I 1
suppose 1
I 1
should 1
think 1
it 1
very 1
unkind 1
if 1
you 1
didn 1
t 1
Jack 1
Well 1
will 1
you 1
go 1
if 1
I 1
change 1
my 1
clothes 1
Algernon 1
Yes 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
too 1
long 1
I 1
never 1
saw 1
anybody 1
take 1
so 1
long 1
to 1
dress 1
and 1
with 1
such 1
little 1
result 1
Jack 1
Well 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
that 1
is 1
better 1
than 1
being 1
always 1
over 1
dressed 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
Algernon 1
If 1
I 1
am 1
occasionally 1
a 1
little 1
over 1
dressed 1
I 1
make 1
up 1
for 1
it 1
by 1
being 1
always 1
immensely 1
over 1
educated 1
Jack 1
Your 1
vanity 1
is 1
ridiculous 1
your 1
conduct 1
an 1
outrage 1
and 1
your 1
presence 1
in 1
my 1
garden 1
utterly 1
absurd 1
However 1
you 1
have 1
got 1
to 1
catch 1
the 1
four 1
five 1
and 1
I 1
hope 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
a 1
pleasant 1
journey 1
back 1
to 1
town 1
This 1
Bunburying 1
as 1
you 1
call 1
it 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
a 1
great 1
success 1
for 1
you 1
Goes 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
Algernon 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
great 1
success 1
I 1
m 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
Cecily 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
everything 1
Enter 1
Cecily 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
garden 1
She 1
picks 1
up 1
the 1
can 1
and 1
begins 1
to 1
water 1
the 1
flowers 1
But 1
I 1
must 1
see 1
her 1
before 1
I 1
go 1
and 1
make 1
arrangements 1
for 1
another 1
Bunbury 1
Ah 1
there 1
she 1
is 1
Cecily 1
Oh 1
I 1
merely 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
water 1
the 1
roses 1
I 1
thought 1
you 1
were 1
with 1
Uncle 1
Jack 1
Algernon 1
He 1
s 1
gone 1
to 1
order 1
the 1
dog 1
cart 1
for 1
me 1
Cecily 1
Oh 1
is 1
he 1
going 1
to 1
take 1
you 1
for 1
a 1
nice 1
drive 1
Algernon 1
He 1
s 1
going 1
to 1
send 1
me 1
away 1
Cecily 1
Then 1
have 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
part 1
Algernon 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
so 1
It 1
s 1
a 1
very 1
painful 1
parting 1
Cecily 1
It 1
is 1
always 1
painful 1
to 1
part 1
from 1
people 1
whom 1
one 1
has 1
known 1
for 1
a 1
very 1
brief 1
space 1
of 1
time 1
The 1
absence 1
of 1
old 1
friends 1
one 1
can 1
endure 1
with 1
equanimity 1
But 1
even 1
a 1
momentary 1
separation 1
from 1
anyone 1
to 1
whom 1
one 1
has 1
just 1
been 1
introduced 1
is 1
almost 1
unbearable 1
Algernon 1
Thank 1
you 1
Enter 1
Merriman 2
The 1
dog 1
cart 1
is 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
sir 1
Algernon 1
looks 1
appealingly 1
at 1
Cecily 2
It 1
can 1
wait 1
Merriman 1
for 1
five 1
minutes 1
Merriman 1
Yes 1
Miss 1
Exit 1
Merriman 1
Algernon 1
I 1
hope 1
Cecily 1
I 1
shall 1
not 1
offend 1
you 1
if 1
I 1
state 1
quite 1
frankly 1
and 1
openly 1
that 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
the 1
visible 1
personification 1
of 1
absolute 1
perfection 1
Cecily 1
I 1
think 1
your 1
frankness 1
does 1
you 1
great 1
credit 1
Ernest 1
If 1
you 1
will 1
allow 1
me 1
I 1
will 1
copy 1
your 1
remarks 1
into 1
my 1
diary 1
Goes 1
over 1
to 1
table 1
and 1
begins 1
writing 1
in 1
diary 1
Algernon 1
Do 1
you 1
really 1
keep 1
a 1
diary 1
I 1
d 1
give 1
anything 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
May 1
I 1
Cecily 1
Oh 1
no 1
Puts 1
her 1
hand 1
over 1
it 1
You 1
see 1
it 1
is 1
simply 1
a 1
very 1
young 1
girl 1
s 1
record 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
thoughts 1
and 1
impressions 1
and 1
consequently 1
meant 1
for 1
publication 1
When 1
it 1
appears 1
in 1
volume 1
form 1
I 1
hope 1
you 1
will 1
order 1
a 1
copy 1
But 1
pray 1
Ernest 1
don 1
t 1
stop 1
I 1
delight 1
in 1
taking 1
down 1
from 1
dictation 1
I 1
have 1
reached 1
absolute 1
perfection 1
You 1
can 1
go 1
on 1
I 1
am 1
quite 1
ready 1
for 1
more 1
Algernon 1
Somewhat 1
taken 1
aback 1
Ahem 2
Cecily 1
Oh 1
don 1
t 1
cough 1
Ernest 1
When 1
one 1
is 1
dictating 1
one 1
should 1
speak 1
fluently 1
and 1
not 1
cough 1
Besides 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
spell 1
a 1
cough 1
Writes 1
as 1
Algernon 1
speaks 1
Algernon 1
Speaking 1
very 1
rapidly 1
Cecily 1
ever 1
since 1
I 1
first 1
looked 1
upon 1
your 1
wonderful 1
and 1
incomparable 1
beauty 1
I 1
have 1
dared 1
to 1
love 1
you 1
wildly 1
passionately 1
devotedly 1
hopelessly 1
Cecily 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
love 1
me 1
wildly 1
passionately 1
devotedly 1
hopelessly 1
Hopelessly 1
doesn 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
make 1
much 1
sense 1
does 1
it 1
Algernon 1
Cecily 1
Enter 1
Merriman 2
The 1
dog 1
cart 1
is 1
waiting 1
sir 1
Algernon 1
Tell 1
it 1
to 1
come 1
round 1
next 1
week 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
hour 1
Merriman 1
Looks 1
at 1
Cecily 1
who 1
makes 1
no 1
sign 1
Yes 1
sir 1
Merriman 1
retires 1
Cecily 1
Uncle 1
Jack 1
would 1
be 1
very 1
much 1
annoyed 1
if 1
he 1
knew 1
you 1
were 1
staying 1
on 1
till 1
next 1
week 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
hour 1
Algernon 1
Oh 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
about 1
Jack 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
for 1
anybody 1
in 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
but 1
you 1
I 1
love 1
you 1
Cecily 1
You 1
will 1
marry 1
me 1
won 1
t 1
you 1
Cecily 1
You 1
silly 1
boy 1
Of 1
course 1
Why 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
engaged 1
for 1
the 1
last 1
three 1
months 1
Algernon 1
For 1
the 1
last 1
three 1
months 1
Cecily 1
Yes 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
exactly 1
three 1
months 1
on 1
Thursday 1
Algernon 1
But 1
how 1
did 1
we 1
become 1
engaged 1
Cecily 1
Well 1
ever 1
since 1
dear 1
Uncle 1
Jack 1
first 1
confessed 1
to 1
us 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
younger 1
brother 1
who 1
was 1
very 1
wicked 1
and 1
bad 1
you 1
of 1
course 1
have 1
formed 1
the 1
chief 1
topic 1
of 1
conversation 1
between 1
myself 1
and 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
And 1
of 1
course 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
much 1
talked 1
about 1
is 1
always 1
very 1
attractive 1
One 1
feels 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
something 1
in 1
him 1
after 1
all 1
I 1
daresay 1
it 1
was 1
foolish 1
of 1
me 1
but 1
I 1
fell 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
you 1
Ernest 1
Algernon 1
Darling 1
And 1
when 1
was 1
the 1
engagement 1
actually 1
settled 1
Cecily 1
On 1
the 1
th 1
of 1
February 1
last 1
Worn 1
out 1
by 1
your 1
entire 1
ignorance 1
of 1
my 1
existence 1
I 1
determined 1
to 1
end 1
the 1
matter 1
one 1
way 1
or 1
the 1
other 1
and 1
after 1
a 1
long 1
struggle 1
with 1
myself 1
I 1
accepted 1
you 1
under 1
this 1
dear 1
old 1
tree 1
here 1
The 1
next 1
day 1
I 1
bought 1
this 1
little 1
ring 1
in 1
your 1
name 1
and 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
little 1
bangle 1
with 1
the 1
true 1
lover 1
s 1
knot 1
I 1
promised 1
you 1
always 1
to 1
wear 1
Algernon 1
Did 1
I 1
give 1
you 1
this 1
It 1
s 1
very 1
pretty 1
isn 1
t 1
it 1
Cecily 1
Yes 1
you 1
ve 1
wonderfully 1
good 1
taste 1
Ernest 1
It 1
s 1
the 1
excuse 1
I 1
ve 1
always 1
given 1
for 1
your 1
leading 1
such 1
a 1
bad 1
life 1
And 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
box 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
keep 1
all 1
your 1
dear 1
letters 1
Kneels 1
at 1
table 1
opens 1
box 1
and 1
produces 1
letters 1
tied 1
up 1
with 1
blue 1
ribbon 1
Algernon 1
My 1
letters 1
But 1
my 1
own 1
sweet 1
Cecily 1
I 1
have 1
never 1
written 1
you 1
any 1
letters 1
Cecily 1
You 1
need 1
hardly 1
remind 1
me 1
of 1
that 1
Ernest 1
I 1
remember 1
only 1
too 1
well 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
write 1
your 1
letters 1
for 1
you 1
I 1
wrote 1
always 1
three 1
times 1
a 1
week 1
and 1
sometimes 1
oftener 1
Algernon 1
Oh 1
do 1
let 1
me 1
read 1
them 1
Cecily 2
Oh 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
possibly 1
They 1
would 1
make 1
you 1
far 1
too 1
conceited 1
Replaces 1
box 1
The 1
three 1
you 1
wrote 1
me 1
after 1
I 1
had 1
broken 1
off 1
the 1
engagement 1
are 1
so 1
beautiful 1
and 1
so 1
badly 1
spelled 1
that 1
even 1
now 1
I 1
can 1
hardly 1
read 1
them 1
without 1
crying 1
a 1
little 1
Algernon 1
But 1
was 1
our 1
engagement 1
ever 1
broken 1
off 1
Cecily 1
Of 1
course 1
it 1
was 1
On 1
the 1
nd 1
of 1
last 1
March 1
You 1
can 1
see 1

entry 1

Shows 1

To 1
day 1
I 1
broke 1
off 1
my 1
engagement 1
with 1
Ernest 1
I 1
feel 1
it 1
is 1
better 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
The 1
weather 1
still 1
continues 1
charming 1
Algernon 1
But 1
why 1
on 1
earth 1
did 1
you 1
break 1
it 1
off 1
What 1
had 1
I 1
done 1
I 1
had 1
done 1
nothing 1
at 1
all 1
Cecily 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
much 1
hurt 1
indeed 1
to 1
hear 1
you 1
broke 1
it 1
off 1
Particularly 1
when 1
the 1
weather 1
was 1
so 1
charming 1
Cecily 1
It 1
would 1
hardly 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
really 1
serious 1
engagement 1
if 1
it 1
hadn 1
t 1
been 1
broken 1
off 1
at 1
least 1
once 1
But 1
I 1
forgave 1
you 1
before 1
the 1
week 1
was 1
out 1
Algernon 1
Crossing 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
kneeling 1
What 1
a 1
perfect 1
angel 1
you 1
are 1
Cecily 2
You 1
dear 1
romantic 1
boy 1
He 1
kisses 1
her 1
she 1
puts 1
her 1
fingers 1
through 1
his 1
hair 1
I 1
hope 1
your 1
hair 1
curls 1
naturally 1
does 1
it 1
Algernon 1
Yes 1
darling 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
help 1
from 1
others 1
Cecily 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
glad 1
Algernon 1
You 1
ll 1
never 1
break 1
off 1
our 1
engagement 1
again 1
Cecily 2
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
I 1
could 1
break 1
it 1
off 1
now 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
actually 1
met 1
you 1
Besides 1
of 1
course 1
there 1
is 1
the 1
question 1
of 1
your 1
name 1
Algernon 1
Yes 1
of 1
course 1
Nervously 1
Cecily 1
You 1
must 1
not 1
laugh 1
at 1
me 1
darling 1
but 1
it 1
had 1
always 1
been 1
a 1
girlish 1
dream 1
of 1
mine 1
to 1
love 1
some 1
one 1
whose 1
name 1
was 1
Ernest 1
Algernon 1
rises 1
Cecily 1
also 1
There 1
is 1
something 1
in 1
that 1
name 1
that 1
seems 1
to 1
inspire 1
absolute 1
confidence 1
I 1
pity 1
any 1
poor 1
married 1
woman 1
whose 1
husband 1
is 1
not 1
called 1
Ernest 1
Algernon 1
But 1
my 1
dear 1
child 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
to 1
say 1
you 1
could 1
not 1
love 1
me 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
some 1
other 1
name 1
Cecily 1
But 1
what 1
name 1
Algernon 1
Oh 1
any 1
name 1
you 1
like 1
Algernon 1
for 1
instance 1
Cecily 1
But 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
Algernon 2
Well 1
my 1
own 1
dear 1
sweet 1
loving 1
little 1
darling 1
I 1
really 1
can 1
t 1
see 1
why 1
you 1
should 1
object 1
to 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
Algernon 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
a 1
bad 1
name 1
In 1
fact 1
it 1
is 1
rather 1
an 1
aristocratic 1
name 1
Half 1
of 1
the 1
chaps 1
who 1
get 1
into 1
the 1
Bankruptcy 1
Court 1
are 1
called 1
Algernon 1
But 1
seriously 1
Cecily 1
Moving 1
to 1
her 1
if 1
my 1
name 1
was 1
Algy 1
couldn 1
t 1
you 1
love 1
me 1
Cecily 1
Rising 1
I 1
might 1
respect 1
you 1
Ernest 1
I 1
might 1
admire 1
your 1
character 1
but 1
I 1
fear 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
give 1
you 1
my 1
undivided 1
attention 1
Algernon 1
Ahem 1
Cecily 1
Picking 1
up 1
hat 1
Your 1
Rector 1
here 1
is 1
I 1
suppose 1
thoroughly 1
experienced 1
in 1
the 1
practice 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
rites 1
and 1
ceremonials 1
of 1
the 1
Church 1
Cecily 1
Oh 1
yes 1
Dr 1
Chasuble 1
is 1
a 1
most 1
learned 1
man 1
He 1
has 1
never 1
written 1
a 1
single 1
book 1
so 1
you 1
can 1
imagine 1
how 1
much 1
he 1
knows 1
Algernon 1
I 1
must 1
see 1
him 1
at 1
once 1
on 1
a 1
most 1
important 1
christening 1
I 1
mean 1
on 1
most 1
important 1
business 1
Cecily 1
Oh 1
Algernon 1
I 1
shan 1
t 1
be 1
away 1
more 1
than 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
Cecily 1
Considering 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
engaged 1
since 1
February 1
the 1
th 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
only 1
met 1
you 1
to 1
day 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
rather 1
hard 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
leave 1
me 1
for 1
so 1
long 1
a 1
period 1
as 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
Couldn 1
t 1
you 1
make 1
it 1
twenty 1
minutes 1
Algernon 1
I 1
ll 1
be 1
back 1
in 1
no 1
time 1
Kisses 1
her 1
and 1
rushes 1
down 1
the 1
garden 1
Cecily 1
What 1
an 1
impetuous 1
boy 1
he 1
is 1
I 1
like 1
his 1
hair 1
so 1
much 1
I 1
must 1
enter 1
his 1
proposal 1
in 1
my 1
diary 1
Enter 1
Merriman 2
A 1
Miss 1
Fairfax 1
has 1
just 1
called 1
to 1
see 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
On 1
very 1
important 1
business 1
Miss 1
Fairfax 1
states 1
Cecily 1
Isn 1
t 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
in 1
his 1
library 1
Merriman 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
went 1
over 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
Rectory 1
some 1
time 1
ago 1
Cecily 1
Pray 1
ask 1
the 1
lady 1
to 1
come 1
out 1
here 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
is 1
sure 1
to 1
be 1
back 1
soon 1
And 1
you 1
can 1
bring 1
tea 1
Merriman 1
Yes 1
Miss 1
Goes 1
out 1
Cecily 1
Miss 1
Fairfax 1
I 1
suppose 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
many 1
good 1
elderly 1
women 1
who 1
are 1
associated 1
with 1
Uncle 1
Jack 1
in 1
some 1
of 1
his 1
philanthropic 1
work 1
in 1
London 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
quite 1
like 1
women 1
who 1
are 1
interested 1
in 1
philanthropic 1
work 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
forward 1
of 1
them 1
Enter 1
Merriman 2
Miss 1
Fairfax 1
Enter 1
Gwendolen 1
Exit 1
Merriman 1
Cecily 1
Advancing 1
to 1
meet 1
her 1
Pray 1
let 1
me 1
introduce 1
myself 1
to 1
you 1
My 1
name 1
is 1
Cecily 1
Cardew 1
Gwendolen 1
Cecily 1
Cardew 1
Moving 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
shaking 1
hands 1
What 1
a 1
very 1
sweet 1
name 1
Something 1
tells 1
me 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
great 1
friends 1
I 1
like 1
you 1
already 1
more 1
than 1
I 1
can 1
say 1
My 1
first 1
impressions 1
of 1
people 1
are 1
never 1
wrong 1
Cecily 1
How 1
nice 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
like 1
me 1
so 1
much 1
after 1
we 1
have 1
known 1
each 1
other 1
such 1
a 1
comparatively 1
short 1
time 1
Pray 1
sit 1
down 1
Gwendolen 1
Still 1
standing 1
up 1
I 1
may 1
call 1
you 1
Cecily 1
may 1
I 1
not 1
Cecily 1
With 1
pleasure 1
Gwendolen 1
And 1
you 1
will 1
always 1
call 1
me 1
Gwendolen 1
won 1
t 1
you 1
Cecily 1
If 1
you 1
wish 1
Gwendolen 1
Then 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
quite 1
settled 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
Cecily 1
I 1
hope 1
so 1
A 1
pause 1
They 1
both 1
sit 1
down 1
together 1
Gwendolen 1
Perhaps 1
this 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
favourable 1
opportunity 1
for 1
my 1
mentioning 1
who 1
I 1
am 1
My 1
father 1
is 1
Lord 1
Bracknell 1
You 1
have 1
never 1
heard 1
of 1
papa 1
I 1
suppose 1
Cecily 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
so 1
Gwendolen 1
Outside 1
the 1
family 1
circle 1
papa 1
I 1
am 1
glad 1
to 1
say 1
is 1
entirely 1
unknown 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
is 1
quite 1
as 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
The 1
home 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
proper 1
sphere 1
for 1
the 1
man 1
And 1
certainly 1
once 1
a 1
man 1
begins 1
to 1
neglect 1
his 1
domestic 1
duties 1
he 1
becomes 1
painfully 1
effeminate 1
does 1
he 1
not 1
And 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
that 1
It 1
makes 1
men 1
so 1
very 1
attractive 1
Cecily 1
mamma 1
whose 1
views 1
on 1
education 1
are 1
remarkably 1
strict 1
has 1
brought 1
me 1
up 1
to 1
be 1
extremely 1
short 1
sighted 1
it 1
is 1
part 1
of 1
her 1
system 1
so 1
do 1
you 1
mind 1
my 1
looking 1
at 1
you 1
through 1
my 1
glasses 1
Cecily 1
Oh 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
Gwendolen 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
being 1
looked 1
at 1
Gwendolen 1
After 1
examining 1
Cecily 1
carefully 1
through 1
a 1
lorgnette 1
You 1
are 1
here 1
on 1
a 1
short 1
visit 1
I 1
suppose 1
Cecily 1
Oh 1
no 1
I 1
live 1
here 1
Gwendolen 1
Severely 1
Really 1
Your 1
mother 1
no 1
doubt 1
or 1
some 1
female 1
relative 1
of 1
advanced 1
years 1
resides 1
here 1
also 1
Cecily 1
Oh 1
no 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
mother 1
nor 1
in 1
fact 1
any 1
relations 1
Gwendolen 1
Indeed 1
Cecily 1
My 1
dear 1
guardian 1
with 1
the 1
assistance 1
of 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
has 1
the 1
arduous 1
task 1
of 1
looking 1
after 1
me 1
Gwendolen 1
Your 1
guardian 1
Cecily 1
Yes 1
I 1
am 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
s 1
ward 1
Gwendolen 1
Oh 1
It 1
is 1
strange 1
he 1
never 1
mentioned 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
ward 1
How 1
secretive 1
of 1
him 1
He 1
grows 1
more 1
interesting 1
hourly 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
sure 1
however 1
that 1
the 1
news 1
inspires 1
me 1
with 1
feelings 1
of 1
unmixed 1
delight 1
Rising 1
and 1
going 1
to 1
her 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
you 1
Cecily 1
I 1
have 1
liked 1
you 1
ever 1
since 1
I 1
met 1
you 1
But 1
I 1
am 1
bound 1
to 1
state 1
that 1
now 1
that 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
s 1
ward 1
I 1
cannot 1
help 1
expressing 1
a 1
wish 1
you 1
were 1
well 1
just 1
a 1
little 1
older 1
than 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
and 1
not 1
quite 1
so 1
very 1
alluring 1
in 1
appearance 1
In 1
fact 1
if 1
I 1
may 1
speak 1
candidly 1
Cecily 1
Pray 1
do 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
whenever 1
one 1
has 1
anything 1
unpleasant 1
to 1
say 1
one 1
should 1
always 1
be 1
quite 1
candid 1
Gwendolen 1
Well 1
to 1
speak 1
with 1
perfect 1
candour 1
Cecily 1
I 1
wish 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
fully 1
forty 1
two 1
and 1
more 1
than 1
usually 1
plain 1
for 1
your 1
age 1
Ernest 1
has 1
a 1
strong 1
upright 1
nature 1
He 1
is 1
the 1
very 1
soul 1
of 1
truth 1
and 1
honour 1
Disloyalty 1
would 1
be 1
as 1
impossible 1
to 1
him 1
as 1
deception 1
But 1
even 1
men 1
of 1
the 1
noblest 1
possible 1
moral 1
character 1
are 1
extremely 1
susceptible 1
to 1
the 1
influence 1
of 1
the 1
physical 1
charms 1
of 1
others 1
Modern 1
no 1
less 1
than 1
Ancient 1
History 1
supplies 1
us 1
with 1
many 1
most 1
painful 1
examples 1
of 1
what 1
I 1
refer 1
to 1
If 1
it 1
were 1
not 1
so 1
indeed 1
History 1
would 1
be 1
quite 1
unreadable 1
Cecily 1
I 1
beg 1
your 1
pardon 1
Gwendolen 1
did 1
you 1
say 1
Ernest 1
Gwendolen 1
Yes 1
Cecily 1
Oh 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
Mr 1
Ernest 1
Worthing 1
who 1
is 1
my 1
guardian 1
It 1
is 1
his 1
brother 1
his 1
elder 1
brother 1
Gwendolen 1
Sitting 1
down 1
again 1
Ernest 1
never 1
mentioned 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
brother 1
Cecily 1
I 1
am 1
sorry 1
to 1
say 1
they 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
on 1
good 1
terms 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
Gwendolen 1
Ah 1
that 1
accounts 1
for 1
it 1
And 1
now 1
that 1
I 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
I 1
have 1
never 1
heard 1
any 1
man 1
mention 1
his 1
brother 1
The 1
subject 1
seems 1
distasteful 1
to 1
most 1
men 1
Cecily 1
you 1
have 1
lifted 1
a 1
load 1
from 1
my 1
mind 1
I 1
was 1
growing 1
almost 1
anxious 1
It 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
terrible 1
if 1
any 1
cloud 1
had 1
come 1
across 1
a 1
friendship 1
like 1
ours 1
would 1
it 1
not 1
Of 1
course 1
you 1
are 1
quite 2
sure 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
Mr 1
Ernest 1
Worthing 1
who 1
is 1
your 1
guardian 1
Cecily 1
Quite 1
sure 1
A 1
pause 1
In 1
fact 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
his 1
Gwendolen 1
Inquiringly 1
I 1
beg 1
your 1
pardon 1
Cecily 1
Rather 1
shy 1
and 1
confidingly 1
Dearest 1
Gwendolen 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
reason 1
why 1
I 1
should 1
make 1
a 1
secret 1
of 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
Our 1
little 1
county 1
newspaper 1
is 1
sure 1
to 1
chronicle 1
the 1
fact 1
next 1
week 1
Mr 1
Ernest 1
Worthing 1
and 1
I 1
are 1
engaged 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
Gwendolen 1
Quite 1
politely 1
rising 1
My 1
darling 1
Cecily 1
I 1
think 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
some 1
slight 1
error 1
Mr 1
Ernest 1
Worthing 1
is 1
engaged 1
to 1
me 1
The 1
announcement 1
will 1
appear 1
in 1
the 1
Morning 1
Post 1
on 1
Saturday 1
at 1
the 1
latest 1
Cecily 1
Very 1
politely 1
rising 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
you 1
must 1
be 1
under 1
some 1
misconception 1
Ernest 1
proposed 1
to 1
me 1
exactly 1
ten 1
minutes 1
ago 1
Shows 1
diary 1
Gwendolen 1
Examines 1
diary 1
through 1
her 1
lorgnettte 1
carefully 1
It 1
is 1
certainly 1
very 1
curious 1
for 1
he 1
asked 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
his 1
wife 1
yesterday 1
afternoon 1
at 1
If 1
you 1
would 1
care 1
to 1
verify 1
the 1
incident 1
pray 1
do 1
so 1
Produces 1
diary 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
I 1
never 1
travel 1
without 1
my 1
diary 1
One 1
should 1
always 1
have 1
something 1
sensational 1
to 1
read 1
in 1
the 1
train 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
sorry 1
dear 1
Cecily 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
any 1
disappointment 1
to 1
you 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
I 1
have 1
the 1
prior 1
claim 1
Cecily 1
It 1
would 1
distress 1
me 1
more 1
than 1
I 1
can 1
tell 1
you 1
dear 1
Gwendolen 1
if 1
it 1
caused 1
you 1
any 1
mental 1
or 1
physical 1
anguish 1
but 1
I 1
feel 1
bound 1
to 1
point 1
out 1
that 1
since 1
Ernest 1
proposed 1
to 1
you 1
he 1
clearly 1
has 1
changed 1
his 1
mind 1
Gwendolen 1
Meditatively 1
If 1
the 1
poor 1
fellow 1
has 1
been 1
entrapped 1
into 1
any 1
foolish 1
promise 1
I 1
shall 1
consider 1
it 1
my 1
duty 1
to 1
rescue 1
him 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
firm 1
hand 1
Cecily 1
Thoughtfully 1
and 1
sadly 1
Whatever 1
unfortunate 1
entanglement 1
my 1
dear 1
boy 1
may 1
have 1
got 1
into 1
I 1
will 1
never 1
reproach 1
him 1
with 1
it 1
after 1
we 1
are 1
married 1
Gwendolen 1
Do 1
you 1
allude 1
to 1
me 1
Miss 1
Cardew 1
as 1
an 1
entanglement 1
You 1
are 1
presumptuous 1
On 1
an 1
occasion 1
of 1
this 1
kind 1
it 1
becomes 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
moral 1
duty 1
to 1
speak 1
one 1
s 1
mind 1
It 1
becomes 1
a 1
pleasure 1
Cecily 1
Do 1
you 1
suggest 1
Miss 1
Fairfax 1
that 1
I 1
entrapped 1
Ernest 1
into 1
an 1
engagement 1
How 1
dare 1
you 1
This 1
is 1
no 1
time 1
for 1
wearing 1
the 1
shallow 1
mask 1
of 1
manners 1
When 1
I 1
see 1
a 1
spade 1
I 1
call 1
it 1
a 1
spade 1
Gwendolen 1
Satirically 1
I 1
am 1
glad 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
never 1
seen 1
a 1
spade 1
It 1
is 1
obvious 1
that 1
our 1
social 1
spheres 1
have 1
been 1
widely 1
different 1
Enter 1
Merriman 1
followed 1
by 1
the 1
footman 1
He 1
carries 1
a 1
salver 1
table 1
cloth 1
and 1
plate 1
stand 1
Cecily 1
is 1
about 1
to 1
retort 1
The 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
servants 1
exercises 1
a 1
restraining 1
influence 1
under 1
which 1
both 1
girls 1
chafe 1
Merriman 1
Shall 1
I 1
lay 1
tea 1
here 1
as 1
usual 1
Miss 1
Cecily 1
Sternly 1
in 1
a 1
calm 1
voice 1
Yes 1
as 1
usual 1
Merriman 1
begins 1
to 1
clear 1
table 1
and 1
lay 1
cloth 1
A 1
long 1
pause 1
Cecily 1
and 1
Gwendolen 1
glare 1
at 1
each 1
other 1
Gwendolen 1
Are 1
there 1
many 1
interesting 1
walks 1
in 1
the 1
vicinity 1
Miss 1
Cardew 1
Cecily 1
Oh 1
yes 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
From 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
hills 1
quite 1
close 1
one 1
can 1
see 1
five 1
counties 1
Gwendolen 1
Five 1
counties 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
that 1
I 1
hate 1
crowds 1
Cecily 1
Sweetly 1
I 1
suppose 1
that 1
is 1
why 1
you 1
live 1
in 1
town 1
Gwendolen 1
bites 1
her 1
lip 1
and 1
beats 1
her 1
foot 1
nervously 1
with 1
her 1
parasol 1
Gwendolen 1
Looking 1
round 1
Quite 1
a 1
well 1
kept 1
garden 1
this 1
is 1
Miss 1
Cardew 1
Cecily 1
So 1
glad 1
you 1
like 1
it 1
Miss 1
Fairfax 1
Gwendolen 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
there 1
were 1
any 1
flowers 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
Cecily 1
Oh 1
flowers 1
are 1
as 1
common 1
here 1
Miss 1
Fairfax 1
as 1
people 1
are 1
in 1
London 1
Gwendolen 1
Personally 1
I 1
cannot 1
understand 1
how 1
anybody 1
manages 1
to 1
exist 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
if 1
anybody 1
who 1
is 1
anybody 1
does 1
The 1
country 1
always 1
bores 1
me 1
to 1
death 1
Cecily 1
Ah 1
This 1
is 1
what 1
the 1
newspapers 1
call 1
agricultural 1
depression 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
I 1
believe 1
the 1
aristocracy 1
are 1
suffering 1
very 1
much 1
from 1
it 1
just 1
at 1
present 1
It 1
is 1
almost 1
an 1
epidemic 1
amongst 1
them 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
told 1
May 1
I 1
offer 1
you 1
some 1
tea 1
Miss 1
Fairfax 1
Gwendolen 1
With 1
elaborate 1
politeness 1
Thank 1
you 1
Aside 1
Detestable 1
girl 1
But 1
I 1
require 1
tea 1
Cecily 1
Sweetly 1
Sugar 1
Gwendolen 1
Superciliously 1
No 1
thank 1
you 1
Sugar 1
is 1
not 1
fashionable 1
any 1
more 1
Cecily 1
looks 1
angrily 1
at 1
her 1
takes 1
up 1
the 1
tongs 1
and 1
puts 1
four 1
lumps 1
of 1
sugar 1
into 1
the 1
cup 1
Cecily 1
Severely 1
Cake 1
or 1
bread 1
and 1
butter 1
Gwendolen 1
In 1
a 1
bored 1
manner 1
Bread 1
and 1
butter 1
please 1
Cake 1
is 1
rarely 1
seen 1
at 1
the 1
best 1
houses 1
nowadays 1
Cecily 1
Cuts 1
a 1
very 1
large 1
slice 1
of 1
cake 1
and 1
puts 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
tray 1
Hand 1
that 1
to 1
Miss 1
Fairfax 1
Merriman 1
does 1
so 1
and 1
goes 1
out 1
with 1
footman 1
Gwendolen 1
drinks 1
the 1
tea 1
and 1
makes 1
a 1
grimace 1
Puts 1
down 1
cup 1
at 1
once 1
reaches 1
out 1
her 1
hand 1
to 1
the 1
bread 1
and 1
butter 1
looks 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
finds 1
it 1
is 1
cake 1
Rises 1
in 1
indignation 1
Gwendolen 1
You 1
have 1
filled 1
my 1
tea 1
with 1
lumps 1
of 1
sugar 1
and 1
though 1
I 1
asked 1
most 1
distinctly 1
for 1
bread 1
and 1
butter 1
you 1
have 1
given 1
me 1
cake 1
I 1
am 1
known 1
for 1
the 1
gentleness 1
of 1
my 1
disposition 1
and 1
the 1
extraordinary 1
sweetness 1
of 1
my 1
nature 1
but 1
I 1
warn 1
you 1
Miss 1
Cardew 1
you 1
may 1
go 1
too 1
far 1
Cecily 1
Rising 1
To 1
save 1
my 1
poor 1
innocent 1
trusting 1
boy 1
from 1
the 1
machinations 1
of 1
any 1
other 1
girl 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
lengths 1
to 1
which 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
go 1
Gwendolen 1
From 1
the 1
moment 1
I 1
saw 1
you 1
I 1
distrusted 1
you 1
I 1
felt 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
false 1
and 1
deceitful 1
I 1
am 1
never 1
deceived 1
in 1
such 1
matters 1
My 1
first 1
impressions 1
of 1
people 1
are 1
invariably 1
right 1
Cecily 1
It 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
Miss 1
Fairfax 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
trespassing 1
on 1
your 1
valuable 1
time 1
No 1
doubt 1
you 1
have 1
many 1
other 1
calls 1
of 1
a 1
similar 1
character 1
to 1
make 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
Enter 1
Jack 1
Gwendolen 1
Catching 1
sight 1
of 1
him 1
Ernest 1
My 1
own 1

Gwendolen 1
Darling 1
Offers 1
to 1
kiss 1
her 1
Gwendolen 1
Draws 1
back 1
A 1
moment 1
May 1
I 1
ask 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
engaged 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
to 1
this 1
young 1
lady 1
Points 1
to 1
Cecily 1
Jack 1
Laughing 1
To 1
dear 1
little 1
Cecily 1
Of 1
course 1
not 1
What 1
could 1
have 1
put 1
such 1
an 1
idea 1
into 1
your 1
pretty 1
little 1
head 1
Gwendolen 1
Thank 1
you 1
You 1
may 1
Offers 1
her 1
cheek 1
Cecily 1
Very 1
sweetly 1
I 1
knew 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
some 1
misunderstanding 1
Miss 1
Fairfax 1
The 1
gentleman 1
whose 1
arm 1
is 1
at 1
present 1
round 1
your 1
waist 1
is 1
my 1
guardian 1
Mr 1
John 1
Worthing 1
Gwendolen 1
I 1
beg 1
your 1
pardon 1
Cecily 1
This 1
is 1
Uncle 1
Jack 1
Gwendolen 1
Receding 1
Jack 1
Oh 1
Enter 1
Algernon 1
Cecily 1
Here 1
is 1
Ernest 1
Algernon 1
Goes 1
straight 1
over 1
to 1
Cecily 1
without 1
noticing 1
any 1
one 1
else 1
My 1
own 1
love 1
Offers 1
to 1
kiss 1
her 1
Cecily 1
Drawing 1
back 1
A 1
moment 1
Ernest 1
May 1
I 1
ask 1
you 1
are 1
you 1
engaged 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
to 1
this 1
young 1
lady 1
Algernon 1
Looking 1
round 1
To 1
what 1
young 1
lady 1
Good 1
heavens 1
Gwendolen 1
Cecily 1
Yes 1
to 1
good 1
heavens 1
Gwendolen 1
I 1
mean 1
to 1
Gwendolen 1
Algernon 1
Laughing 1
Of 1
course 1
not 1
What 1
could 1
have 1
put 1
such 1
an 1
idea 1
into 1
your 1
pretty 1
little 1
head 1
Cecily 1
Thank 1
you 1
Presenting 1
her 1
cheek 1
to 1
be 1
kissed 1
You 1
may 1
Algernon 1
kisses 1
her 1
Gwendolen 1
I 1
felt 1
there 1
was 1
some 1
slight 1
error 1
Miss 1
Cardew 1
The 1
gentleman 1
who 1
is 1
now 1
embracing 1
you 1
is 1
my 1
cousin 1
Mr 1
Algernon 1
Moncrieff 1
Cecily 1
Breaking 1
away 1
from 1
Algernon 2
Moncrieff 1
Oh 1
The 1
two 1
girls 1
move 1
towards 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
put 1
their 1
arms 1
round 1
each 1
other 1
s 1
waists 1
as 1
if 1
for 1
protection 1
Cecily 1
Are 1
you 1
called 1
Algernon 2
I 1
cannot 1
deny 1
it 1
Cecily 1
Oh 1
Gwendolen 1
Is 1
your 1
name 1
really 1
John 1
Jack 1
Standing 1
rather 1
proudly 1
I 1
could 1
deny 1
it 1
if 1
I 1
liked 1
I 1
could 1
deny 1
anything 1
if 1
I 1
liked 1
But 1
my 1
name 1
certainly 1
is 1
John 1
It 1
has 1
been 1
John 1
for 1
years 1
Cecily 1
To 1
Gwendolen 1
A 1
gross 1
deception 1
has 1
been 1
practised 1
on 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
Gwendolen 1
My 1
poor 1
wounded 1
Cecily 2
My 1
sweet 1
wronged 1
Gwendolen 2
Slowly 1
and 1
seriously 1
You 1
will 1
call 1
me 1
sister 1
will 1
you 1
not 1
They 1
embrace 1
Jack 1
and 1
Algernon 1
groan 1
and 1
walk 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
Cecily 1
Rather 1
brightly 1
There 1
is 1
just 1
one 1
question 1
I 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
ask 1
my 1
guardian 1
Gwendolen 1
An 1
admirable 1
idea 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
there 1
is 1
just 1
one 1
question 1
I 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
be 1
permitted 1
to 1
put 1
to 1
you 1
Where 1
is 1
your 1
brother 1
Ernest 1
We 1
are 1
both 1
engaged 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
to 1
your 1
brother 1
Ernest 1
so 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
some 1
importance 1
to 1
us 1
to 1
know 1
where 1
your 1
brother 1
Ernest 1
is 1
at 1
present 1
Jack 1
Slowly 1
and 1
hesitatingly 1
Gwendolen 1
Cecily 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
painful 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
forced 1
to 1
speak 1
the 1
truth 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
been 1
reduced 1
to 1
such 1
a 1
painful 1
position 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
really 1
quite 1
inexperienced 1
in 1
doing 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
However 1
I 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
quite 1
frankly 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
brother 1
Ernest 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
brother 1
at 1
all 1
I 1
never 1
had 1
a 1
brother 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
and 1
I 1
certainly 1
have 1
not 1
the 1
smallest 1
intention 1
of 1
ever 1
having 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
future 1
Cecily 1
Surprised 1
No 1
brother 1
at 1
all 1
Jack 1
Cheerily 1
None 1
Gwendolen 1
Severely 1
Had 1
you 1
never 1
a 1
brother 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
Jack 1
Pleasantly 1
Never 1
Not 1
even 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
Gwendolen 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
clear 1
Cecily 1
that 1
neither 1
of 1
us 1
is 1
engaged 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
to 1
any 1
one 1
Cecily 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
very 1
pleasant 1
position 1
for 1
a 1
young 1
girl 1
suddenly 1
to 1
find 1
herself 1
in 1
Is 1
it 1
Gwendolen 1
Let 1
us 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
They 1
will 1
hardly 1
venture 1
to 1
come 1
after 1
us 1
there 1
Cecily 1
No 1
men 1
are 1
so 1
cowardly 1
aren 1
t 1
they 1
They 1
retire 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
with 1
scornful 1
looks 1
Jack 1
This 1
ghastly 1
state 1
of 1
things 1
is 1
what 1
you 1
call 1
Bunburying 1
I 1
suppose 1
Algernon 1
Yes 1
and 1
a 1
perfectly 1
wonderful 1
Bunbury 1
it 1
is 1
The 1
most 1
wonderful 1
Bunbury 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
had 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
Jack 1
Well 1
you 1
ve 1
no 1
right 1
whatsoever 1
to 1
Bunbury 1
here 1
Algernon 1
That 1
is 1
absurd 1
One 1
has 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
Bunbury 1
anywhere 1
one 1
chooses 1
Every 1
serious 1
Bunburyist 1
knows 1
that 1
Jack 1
Serious 1
Bunburyist 1
Good 1
heavens 1
Algernon 1
Well 1
one 1
must 1
be 1
serious 1
about 1
something 1
if 1
one 1
wants 1
to 1
have 1
any 1
amusement 1
in 1
life 1
I 1
happen 1
to 1
be 1
serious 1
about 1
Bunburying 1
What 1
on 1
earth 1
you 1
are 1
serious 1
about 1
I 1
haven 1
t 1
got 1
the 1
remotest 1
idea 1
About 1
everything 1
I 1
should 1
fancy 1
You 1
have 1
such 1
an 1
absolutely 1
trivial 1
nature 1
Jack 1
Well 1
the 1
only 1
small 1
satisfaction 1
I 1
have 1
in 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
this 1
wretched 1
business 1
is 1
that 1
your 1
friend 1
Bunbury 1
is 1
quite 1
exploded 1
You 1
won 1
t 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
run 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
country 1
quite 1
so 1
often 1
as 1
you 1
used 1
to 1
do 1
dear 1
Algy 1
And 1
a 1
very 1
good 1
thing 1
too 1
Algernon 1
Your 1
brother 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
off 1
colour 1
isn 1
t 1
he 1
dear 1
Jack 1
You 1
won 1
t 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
disappear 1
to 1
London 1
quite 1
so 1
frequently 1
as 1
your 1
wicked 1
custom 1
was 1
And 1
not 1
a 1
bad 1
thing 1
either 1
Jack 1
As 1
for 1
your 1
conduct 1
towards 1
Miss 1
Cardew 1
I 1
must 1
say 1
that 1
your 1
taking 1
in 1
a 1
sweet 1
simple 1
innocent 1
girl 1
like 1
that 1
is 1
quite 1
inexcusable 1
To 1
say 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
she 1
is 1
my 1
ward 1
Algernon 1
I 1
can 1
see 1
no 1
possible 1
defence 1
at 1
all 1
for 1
your 1
deceiving 1
a 1
brilliant 1
clever 1
thoroughly 1
experienced 1
young 1
lady 1
like 1
Miss 1
Fairfax 1
To 1
say 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
she 1
is 1
my 1
cousin 1
Jack 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
be 1
engaged 1
to 1
Gwendolen 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
I 1
love 1
her 1
Algernon 1
Well 1
I 1
simply 1
wanted 1
to 1
be 1
engaged 1
to 1
Cecily 1
I 1
adore 1
her 1
Jack 1
There 1
is 1
certainly 1
no 1
chance 1
of 1
your 1
marrying 1
Miss 1
Cardew 1
Algernon 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
there 1
is 1
much 1
likelihood 1
Jack 1
of 1
you 1
and 1
Miss 1
Fairfax 1
being 1
united 1
Jack 1
Well 1
that 1
is 1
no 1
business 1
of 1
yours 1
Algernon 1
If 1
it 1
was 1
my 1
business 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
talk 1
about 1
it 1
Begins 1
to 1
eat 1
muffins 1
It 1
is 1
very 1
vulgar 1
to 1
talk 1
about 1
one 1
s 1
business 1
Only 1
people 1
like 1
stock 1
brokers 1
do 1
that 1
and 1
then 1
merely 1
at 1
dinner 1
parties 1
Jack 1
How 1
can 1
you 1
sit 1
there 1
calmly 1
eating 1
muffins 1
when 1
we 1
are 1
in 1
this 1
horrible 1
trouble 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
make 1
out 1
You 1
seem 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
perfectly 1
heartless 1
Algernon 1
Well 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
eat 1
muffins 1
in 1
an 1
agitated 1
manner 1
The 1
butter 1
would 1
probably 1
get 1
on 1
my 1
cuffs 1
One 1
should 1
always 1
eat 1
muffins 1
quite 1
calmly 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
way 1
to 1
eat 1
them 1
Jack 1
I 1
say 1
it 1
s 1
perfectly 1
heartless 1
your 1
eating 1
muffins 1
at 1
all 1
under 1
the 1
circumstances 1
Algernon 1
When 1
I 1
am 1
in 1
trouble 1
eating 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
that 1
consoles 1
me 1
Indeed 1
when 1
I 1
am 1
in 1
really 1
great 1
trouble 1
as 1
any 1
one 1
who 1
knows 1
me 1
intimately 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
I 1
refuse 1
everything 1
except 1
food 1
and 1
drink 1
At 1
the 1
present 1
moment 1
I 1
am 1
eating 1
muffins 1
because 1
I 1
am 1
unhappy 1
Besides 1
I 1
am 1
particularly 1
fond 1
of 1
muffins 1
Rising 1
Jack 1
Rising 1
Well 1
that 1
is 1
no 1
reason 1
why 1
you 1
should 1
eat 1
them 1
all 1
in 1
that 1
greedy 1
way 1
Takes 1
muffins 1
from 1
Algernon 2
Offering 1
tea 1
cake 1
I 1
wish 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
tea 1
cake 1
instead 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
tea 1
cake 1
Jack 1
Good 1
heavens 1
I 1
suppose 1
a 1
man 1
may 1
eat 1
his 1
own 1
muffins 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
garden 1
Algernon 1
But 1
you 1
have 1
just 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
perfectly 1
heartless 1
to 1
eat 1
muffins 1
Jack 1
I 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
perfectly 1
heartless 1
of 1
you 1
under 1
the 1
circumstances 1
That 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
different 1
thing 1
Algernon 1
That 1
may 1
be 1
But 1
the 1
muffins 1
are 1
the 1
same 1
He 1
seizes 1
the 1
muffin 1
dish 1
from 1
Jack 2
Algy 1
I 1
wish 1
to 1
goodness 1
you 1
would 1
go 1
Algernon 1
You 1
can 1
t 1
possibly 1
ask 1
me 1
to 1
go 1
without 1
having 1
some 1
dinner 1
It 1
s 1
absurd 1
I 1
never 1
go 1
without 1
my 1
dinner 1
No 1
one 1
ever 1
does 1
except 1
vegetarians 1
and 1
people 1
like 1
that 1
Besides 1
I 1
have 1
just 1
made 1
arrangements 1
with 1
Dr 1
Chasuble 1
to 1
be 1
christened 1
at 1
a 1
quarter 1
to 1
six 1
under 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
Ernest 1
Jack 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
the 1
sooner 1
you 1
give 1
up 1
that 1
nonsense 1
the 1
better 1
I 1
made 1
arrangements 1
this 1
morning 1
with 1
Dr 1
Chasuble 1
to 1
be 1
christened 1
myself 1
at 1
and 1
I 1
naturally 1
will 1
take 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
Ernest 1
Gwendolen 1
would 1
wish 1
it 1
We 1
can 1
t 1
both 1
be 1
christened 1
Ernest 1
It 1
s 1
absurd 1
Besides 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
perfect 1
right 1
to 1
be 1
christened 1
if 1
I 1
like 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
evidence 1
at 1
all 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
been 1
christened 1
by 1
anybody 1
I 1
should 1
think 1
it 1
extremely 1
probable 1
I 1
never 1
was 1
and 1
so 1
does 1
Dr 1
Chasuble 1
It 1
is 1
entirely 1
different 1
in 1
your 1
case 1
You 1
have 1
been 1
christened 1
already 1
Algernon 1
Yes 1
but 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
christened 1
for 1
years 1
Jack 1
Yes 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
christened 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
important 1
thing 1
Algernon 1
Quite 1
so 1
So 1
I 1
know 1
my 1
constitution 1
can 1
stand 1
it 1
If 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
quite 1
sure 1
about 1
your 1
ever 1
having 1
been 1
christened 1
I 1
must 1
say 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
rather 1
dangerous 1
your 1
venturing 1
on 1
it 1
now 1
It 1
might 1
make 1
you 1
very 1
unwell 1
You 1
can 1
hardly 1
have 1
forgotten 1
that 1
some 1
one 1
very 1
closely 1
connected 1
with 1
you 1
was 1
very 1
nearly 1
carried 1
off 1
this 1
week 1
in 1
Paris 1
by 1
a 1
severe 1
chill 1
Jack 1
Yes 1
but 1
you 1
said 1
yourself 1
that 1
a 1
severe 1
chill 1
was 1
not 1
hereditary 1
Algernon 1
It 1
usen 1
t 1
to 1
be 1
I 1
know 1
but 1
I 1
daresay 1
it 1
is 1
now 1
Science 1
is 1
always 1
making 1
wonderful 1
improvements 1
in 1
things 1
Jack 1
Picking 1
up 1
the 1
muffin 1
dish 1
Oh 1
that 1
is 1
nonsense 1
you 1
are 1
always 1
talking 1
nonsense 1
Algernon 1
Jack 1
you 1
are 1
at 1
the 1
muffins 1
again 1
I 1
wish 1
you 1
wouldn 1
t 1
There 1
are 1
only 1
two 1
left 1
Takes 1
them 1
I 1
told 1
you 1
I 1
was 1
particularly 1
fond 1
of 1
muffins 1
Jack 1
But 1
I 1
hate 1
tea 1
cake 1
Algernon 1
Why 1
on 1
earth 1
then 1
do 1
you 1
allow 1
tea 1
cake 1
to 1
be 1
served 1
up 1
for 1
your 1
guests 1
What 1
ideas 1
you 1
have 1
of 1
hospitality 1
Jack 1
Algernon 1
I 1
have 1
already 1
told 1
you 1
to 1
go 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
you 1
here 1
Why 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
go 1
Algernon 1
I 1
haven 1
t 1
quite 1
finished 1
my 1
tea 1
yet 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
still 1
one 1
muffin 1
left 1
Jack 1
groans 1
and 1
sinks 1
into 1
a 1
chair 1
Algernon 1
still 1
continues 1
eating 1

THIRD 1
ACT 1
SCENE 1
Morning 1
room 1
at 1
the 1
Manor 1
House 1
Gwendolen 1
and 1
Cecily 1
are 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
looking 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
Gwendolen 1
The 1
fact 1
that 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
follow 1
us 1
at 1
once 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
as 1
any 1
one 1
else 1
would 1
have 1
done 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
show 1
that 1
they 1
have 1
some 1
sense 1
of 1
shame 1
left 1
Cecily 1
They 1
have 1
been 1
eating 1
muffins 1
That 1
looks 1
like 1
repentance 1
Gwendolen 1
After 1
a 1
pause 1
They 1
don 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
notice 1
us 1
at 1
all 1
Couldn 1
t 1
you 1
cough 1
Cecily 1
But 1
I 1
haven 1
t 1
got 1
a 1
cough 1
Gwendolen 1
They 1
re 1
looking 1
at 1
us 1
What 1
effrontery 1
Cecily 1
They 1
re 1
approaching 1
That 1
s 1
very 1
forward 1
of 1
them 1
Gwendolen 1
Let 1
us 1
preserve 1
a 1
dignified 1
silence 1
Cecily 1
Certainly 1
It 1
s 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
to 1
do 1
now 1
Enter 1
Jack 1
followed 1
by 1
Algernon 1
They 1
whistle 1
some 1
dreadful 1
popular 1
air 1
from 1
a 1
British 1
Opera 1
Gwendolen 1
This 1
dignified 1
silence 1
seems 1
to 1
produce 1
an 1
unpleasant 1
effect 1
Cecily 1
A 1
most 1
distasteful 1
one 1
Gwendolen 1
But 1
we 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
the 1
first 1
to 1
speak 1
Cecily 1
Certainly 1
not 1
Gwendolen 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
I 1
have 1
something 1
very 1
particular 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
Much 1
depends 1
on 1
your 1
reply 1
Cecily 1
Gwendolen 1
your 1
common 1
sense 1
is 1
invaluable 1
Mr 1
Moncrieff 1
kindly 1
answer 1
me 1
the 1
following 1
question 1
Why 1
did 1
you 1
pretend 1
to 1
be 1
my 1
guardian 1
s 1
brother 1
Algernon 1
In 1
order 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
have 1
an 1
opportunity 1
of 1
meeting 1
you 1
Cecily 1
To 1
Gwendolen 1
That 1
certainly 1
seems 1
a 1
satisfactory 1
explanation 1
does 1
it 1
not 1
Gwendolen 1
Yes 1
dear 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
believe 1
him 1
Cecily 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
But 1
that 1
does 1
not 1
affect 1
the 1
wonderful 1
beauty 1
of 1
his 1
answer 1
Gwendolen 1
True 1
In 1
matters 1
of 1
grave 1
importance 1
style 1
not 1
sincerity 1
is 1
the 1
vital 1
thing 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
what 1
explanation 1
can 1
you 1
offer 1
to 1
me 1
for 1
pretending 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
brother 1
Was 1
it 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
you 1
might 1
have 1
an 1
opportunity 1
of 1
coming 1
up 1
to 1
town 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
as 1
often 1
as 1
possible 1
Jack 1
Can 1
you 1
doubt 1
it 1
Miss 1
Fairfax 1
Gwendolen 1
I 1
have 1
the 1
gravest 1
doubts 1
upon 1
the 1
subject 1
But 1
I 1
intend 1
to 1
crush 1
them 1
This 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
moment 1
for 1
German 1
scepticism 1
Moving 1
to 1
Cecily 1
Their 1
explanations 1
appear 1
to 1
be 1
quite 1
satisfactory 1
especially 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
s 1
That 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
stamp 1
of 1
truth 1
upon 1
it 1
Cecily 1
I 1
am 1
more 1
than 1
content 1
with 1
what 1
Mr 1
Moncrieff 1
said 1
His 1
voice 1
alone 1
inspires 1
one 1
with 1
absolute 1
credulity 1
Gwendolen 1
Then 1
you 1
think 1
we 1
should 1
forgive 1
them 1
Cecily 1
Yes 1
I 1
mean 1
no 1
Gwendolen 1
True 1
I 1
had 1
forgotten 1
There 1
are 1
principles 1
at 1
stake 1
that 1
one 1
cannot 1
surrender 1
Which 1
of 1
us 1
should 1
tell 1
them 1
The 1
task 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
pleasant 1
one 1
Cecily 1
Could 1
we 1
not 1
both 1
speak 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
Gwendolen 1
An 1
excellent 1
idea 1
I 1
nearly 1
always 1
speak 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
as 1
other 1
people 1
Will 1
you 1
take 1
the 1
time 1
from 1
me 1
Cecily 1
Certainly 1
Gwendolen 1
beats 1
time 1
with 1
uplifted 1
finger 1
Gwendolen 1
and 1
Cecily 1
Speaking 1
together 1
Your 1
Christian 1
names 1
are 1
still 1
an 1
insuperable 1
barrier 1
That 1
is 1
all 1
Jack 1
and 1
Algernon 1
Speaking 1
together 1
Our 1
Christian 1
names 1
Is 1
that 1
all 1
But 1
we 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
christened 1
this 1
afternoon 1
Gwendolen 1
To 1
Jack 1
For 1
my 1
sake 1
you 1
are 1
prepared 1
to 1
do 1
this 1
terrible 1
thing 1
Jack 1
I 1
am 1
Cecily 1
To 1
Algernon 1
To 1
please 1
me 1
you 1
are 1
ready 1
to 1
face 1
this 1
fearful 1
ordeal 1
Algernon 1
I 1
am 1
Gwendolen 1
How 1
absurd 1
to 1
talk 1
of 1
the 1
equality 1
of 1
the 1
sexes 1
Where 1
questions 1
of 1
self 1
sacrifice 1
are 1
concerned 1
men 1
are 1
infinitely 1
beyond 1
us 1
Jack 1
We 1
are 1
Clasps 1
hands 1
with 1
Algernon 1
Cecily 1
They 1
have 1
moments 1
of 1
physical 1
courage 1
of 1
which 1
we 1
women 1
know 1
absolutely 1
nothing 1
Gwendolen 1
To 1
Jack 1
Darling 1
Algernon 1
To 1
Cecily 1
Darling 1
They 1
fall 1
into 1
each 1
other 1
s 1
arms 1
Enter 1
Merriman 1
When 1
he 1
enters 1
he 1
coughs 1
loudly 1
seeing 1
the 1
situation 1
Merriman 1
Ahem 2
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Jack 1
Good 1
heavens 1
Enter 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
The 1
couples 1
separate 1
in 1
alarm 1
Exit 1
Merriman 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Gwendolen 1
What 1
does 1
this 1
mean 1
Gwendolen 1
Merely 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
engaged 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
to 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
mamma 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Come 1
here 1
Sit 1
down 1
Sit 1
down 1
immediately 1
Hesitation 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
is 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
mental 1
decay 1
in 1
the 1
young 1
of 1
physical 1
weakness 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
Turns 1
to 1
Jack 1
Apprised 1
sir 1
of 1
my 1
daughter 1
s 1
sudden 1
flight 1
by 1
her 1
trusty 1
maid 1
whose 1
confidence 1
I 1
purchased 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
a 1
small 1
coin 1
I 1
followed 1
her 1
at 1
once 1
by 1
a 1
luggage 1
train 1
Her 1
unhappy 1
father 1
is 1
I 1
am 1
glad 1
to 1
say 1
under 1
the 1
impression 1
that 1
she 1
is 1
attending 1
a 1
more 1
than 1
usually 1
lengthy 1
lecture 1
by 1
the 1
University 1
Extension 1
Scheme 1
on 1
the 1
Influence 1
of 1
a 1
permanent 1
income 1
on 1
Thought 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
propose 1
to 1
undeceive 1
him 1
Indeed 1
I 1
have 1
never 1
undeceived 1
him 1
on 1
any 1
question 1
I 1
would 1
consider 1
it 1
wrong 1
But 1
of 1
course 1
you 1
will 1
clearly 1
understand 1
that 1
all 1
communication 1
between 1
yourself 1
and 1
my 1
daughter 1
must 1
cease 1
immediately 1
from 1
this 1
moment 1
On 1
this 1
point 1
as 1
indeed 1
on 1
all 1
points 1
I 1
am 1
firm 1
Jack 1
I 1
am 1
engaged 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
to 1
Gwendolen 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
You 1
are 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
sir 1
And 1
now 1
as 1
regards 1
Algernon 3
Yes 1
Aunt 1
Augusta 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
May 1
I 1
ask 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
this 1
house 1
that 1
your 1
invalid 1
friend 1
Mr 1
Bunbury 1
resides 1
Algernon 1
Stammering 1
Oh 1
No 1
Bunbury 1
doesn 1
t 1
live 1
here 1
Bunbury 1
is 1
somewhere 1
else 1
at 1
present 1
In 1
fact 1
Bunbury 1
is 1
dead 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Dead 1
When 1
did 1
Mr 1
Bunbury 1
die 1
His 1
death 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
extremely 1
sudden 1
Algernon 1
Airily 1
Oh 1
I 1
killed 1
Bunbury 1
this 1
afternoon 1
I 1
mean 1
poor 1
Bunbury 1
died 1
this 1
afternoon 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
What 1
did 1
he 1
die 1
of 1
Algernon 1
Bunbury 1
Oh 1
he 1
was 1
quite 1
exploded 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Exploded 1
Was 1
he 1
the 1
victim 1
of 1
a 1
revolutionary 1
outrage 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
aware 1
that 1
Mr 1
Bunbury 1
was 1
interested 1
in 1
social 1
legislation 1
If 1
so 1
he 1
is 1
well 1
punished 1
for 1
his 1
morbidity 1
Algernon 1
My 1
dear 1
Aunt 1
Augusta 1
I 1
mean 1
he 1
was 1
found 1
out 1
The 1
doctors 1
found 1
out 1
that 1
Bunbury 1
could 1
not 1
live 1
that 1
is 1
what 1
I 1
mean 1
so 1
Bunbury 1
died 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
He 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
had 1
great 1
confidence 1
in 1
the 1
opinion 1
of 1
his 1
physicians 1
I 1
am 1
glad 1
however 1
that 1
he 1
made 1
up 1
his 1
mind 1
at 1
the 1
last 1
to 1
some 1
definite 1
course 1
of 1
action 1
and 1
acted 1
under 1
proper 1
medical 1
advice 1
And 1
now 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
finally 1
got 1
rid 1
of 1
this 1
Mr 1
Bunbury 1
may 1
I 1
ask 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
who 1
is 1
that 1
young 1
person 1
whose 1
hand 1
my 1
nephew 1
Algernon 1
is 1
now 1
holding 1
in 1
what 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
peculiarly 1
unnecessary 1
manner 1
Jack 1
That 1
lady 1
is 1
Miss 1
Cecily 1
Cardew 1
my 1
ward 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
bows 1
coldly 1
to 1
Cecily 1
Algernon 1
I 1
am 1
engaged 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
to 1
Cecily 1
Aunt 1
Augusta 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
I 1
beg 1
your 1
pardon 1
Cecily 1
Mr 1
Moncrieff 1
and 1
I 1
are 1
engaged 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
With 1
a 1
shiver 1
crossing 1
to 1
the 1
sofa 1
and 1
sitting 1
down 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
whether 1
there 1
is 1
anything 1
peculiarly 1
exciting 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
of 1
this 1
particular 1
part 1
of 1
Hertfordshire 1
but 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
engagements 1
that 1
go 1
on 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
considerably 1
above 1
the 1
proper 1
average 1
that 1
statistics 1
have 1
laid 1
down 1
for 1
our 1
guidance 1
I 1
think 1
some 1
preliminary 1
inquiry 1
on 1
my 1
part 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
out 1
of 1
place 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
is 1
Miss 1
Cardew 1
at 1
all 1
connected 1
with 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
larger 1
railway 1
stations 1
in 1
London 1
I 1
merely 1
desire 1
information 1
Until 1
yesterday 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
any 1
families 1
or 1
persons 1
whose 1
origin 1
was 1
a 1

in 1

But 1
what 1
proof 1
have 1
I 1
of 1
their 1
authenticity 1
Jack 1
I 1
have 1
carefully 1
preserved 1
the 1

publication 1
Jack 1
Miss 1
Cardew 1
s 1
family 1
solicitors 1
are 1
Messrs 1
Markby 2
and 1
Markby 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Markby 2
and 1
Markby 1
A 1
firm 1
of 1
the 1
very 1
highest 1
position 1
in 1
their 1
profession 1
Indeed 1
I 1
am 1
told 1
that 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
Mr 1
Markby 1
s 1
is 1
occasionally 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
at 1
dinner 1
parties 1
So 1
far 1
I 1
am 1
satisfied 1
Jack 1
Very 1
irritably 1
How 1
extremely 1
kind 1
of 1
you 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
I 1
have 1
also 1
in 1
my 1
possession 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
pleased 1
to 1
hear 1
certificates 1
of 1
Miss 1
Cardew 1
s 1
birth 1
baptism 1
whooping 1
cough 1
registration 1
vaccination 1
confirmation 1
and 1
the 1
measles 1
both 1
the 1
German 1
and 1
the 1
English 1
variety 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Ah 1
A 1
life 1
crowded 1
with 1
incident 1
I 1
see 1
though 1
perhaps 1
somewhat 1
too 1
exciting 1
for 1
a 1
young 1
girl 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
myself 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
premature 1
experiences 1
Rises 1
looks 1
at 1
her 1
watch 1
Gwendolen 1
the 1
time 1
approaches 1
for 1
our 1
departure 1
We 1
have 1
not 1
a 1
moment 1
to 1
lose 1
As 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
form 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
I 1
had 1
better 1
ask 1
you 1
if 1
Miss 1
Cardew 1
has 1
any 1
little 1
fortune 1
Jack 1
Oh 1
about 1
a 1
hundred 1
and 1
thirty 1
thousand 1
pounds 1
in 1
the 1
Funds 1
That 1
is 1
all 1
Goodbye 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
So 1
pleased 1
to 1
have 1
seen 1
you 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Sitting 1
down 1
again 1
A 1
moment 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
A 1
hundred 1
and 1
thirty 1
thousand 1
pounds 1
And 1
in 1
the 1
Funds 1
Miss 1
Cardew 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
most 1
attractive 1
young 1
lady 1
now 1
that 1
I 1
look 1
at 1
her 1
Few 1
girls 1
of 1
the 1
present 1
day 1
have 1
any 1
really 1
solid 1
qualities 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
qualities 1
that 1
last 1
and 1
improve 1
with 1
time 1
We 1
live 1
I 1
regret 1
to 1
say 1
in 1
an 1
age 1
of 1
surfaces 1
To 1
Cecily 1
Come 1
over 1
here 1
dear 1
Cecily 1
goes 1
across 1
Pretty 1
child 1
your 1
dress 1
is 1
sadly 1
simple 1
and 1
your 1
hair 1
seems 1
almost 1
as 1
Nature 1
might 1
have 1
left 1
it 1
But 1
we 1
can 1
soon 1
alter 1
all 1
that 1
A 1
thoroughly 1
experienced 1
French 1
maid 1
produces 1
a 1
really 1
marvellous 1
result 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
brief 1
space 1
of 1
time 1
I 1
remember 1
recommending 1
one 1
to 1
young 1
Lady 1
Lancing 1
and 1
after 1
three 1
months 1
her 1
own 1
husband 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
her 1
Jack 1
And 1
after 1
six 1
months 1
nobody 1
knew 1
her 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Glares 1
at 1
Jack 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
Then 1
bends 1
with 1
a 1
practised 1
smile 1
to 1
Cecily 1
Kindly 1
turn 1
round 1
sweet 1
child 1
Cecily 1
turns 1
completely 1
round 1
No 1
the 1
side 1
view 1
is 1
what 1
I 1
want 1
Cecily 1
presents 1
her 1
profile 1
Yes 1
quite 1
as 1
I 1
expected 1
There 1
are 1
distinct 1
social 1
possibilities 1
in 1
your 1
profile 1
The 1
two 1
weak 1
points 1
in 1
our 1
age 1
are 1
its 1
want 1
of 1
principle 1
and 1
its 1
want 1
of 1
profile 1
The 1
chin 1
a 1
little 1
higher 1
dear 1
Style 1
largely 1
depends 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
the 1
chin 1
is 1
worn 1
They 1
are 1
worn 1
very 1
high 1
just 1
at 1
present 1
Algernon 2
Yes 1
Aunt 1
Augusta 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
There 1
are 1
distinct 1
social 1
possibilities 1
in 1
Miss 1
Cardew 1
s 1
profile 1
Algernon 1
Cecily 1
is 1
the 1
sweetest 1
dearest 1
prettiest 1
girl 1
in 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
And 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
twopence 1
about 1
social 1
possibilities 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Never 1
speak 1
disrespectfully 1
of 1
Society 1
Algernon 1
Only 1
people 1
who 1
can 1
t 1
get 1
into 1
it 1
do 1
that 1
To 1
Cecily 1
Dear 1
child 1
of 1
course 1
you 1
know 1
that 1
Algernon 1
has 1
nothing 1
but 1
his 1
debts 1
to 1
depend 1
upon 1
But 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
approve 1
of 1
mercenary 1
marriages 1
When 1
I 1
married 1
Lord 1
Bracknell 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
fortune 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
But 1
I 1
never 1
dreamed 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
of 1
allowing 1
that 1
to 1
stand 1
in 1
my 1
way 1
Well 1
I 1
suppose 1
I 1
must 1
give 1
my 1
consent 1
Algernon 1
Thank 1
you 1
Aunt 1
Augusta 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Cecily 1
you 1
may 1
kiss 1
me 1
Cecily 1
Kisses 1
her 1
Thank 1
you 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
You 1
may 1
also 1
address 1
me 1
as 1
Aunt 1
Augusta 1
for 1
the 1
future 1
Cecily 1
Thank 1
you 1
Aunt 1
Augusta 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
The 1
marriage 1
I 1
think 1
had 1
better 1
take 1
place 1
quite 1
soon 1
Algernon 1
Thank 1
you 1
Aunt 1
Augusta 1
Cecily 1
Thank 1
you 1
Aunt 1
Augusta 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
To 1
speak 1
frankly 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
long 1
engagements 1
They 1
give 1
people 1
the 1
opportunity 1
of 1
finding 1
out 1
each 1
other 1
s 1
character 1
before 1
marriage 1
which 1
I 1
think 1
is 1
never 1
advisable 1
Jack 1
I 1
beg 1
your 1
pardon 1
for 1
interrupting 1
you 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
but 1
this 1
engagement 1
is 1
quite 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
question 1
I 1
am 1
Miss 1
Cardew 1
s 1
guardian 1
and 1
she 1
cannot 1
marry 1
without 1
my 1
consent 1
until 1
she 1
comes 1
of 1
age 1
That 1
consent 1
I 1
absolutely 1
decline 1
to 1
give 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Upon 1
what 1
grounds 1
may 1
I 1
ask 1
Algernon 1
is 1
an 1
extremely 1
I 1
may 1
almost 1
say 1
an 1
ostentatiously 1
eligible 1
young 1
man 1
He 1
has 1
nothing 1
but 1
he 1
looks 1
everything 1
What 1
more 1
can 1
one 1
desire 1
Jack 1
It 1
pains 1
me 1
very 1
much 1
to 1
have 1
to 1
speak 1
frankly 1
to 1
you 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
about 1
your 1
nephew 1
but 1
the 1
fact 1
is 1
that 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
approve 1
at 1
all 1
of 1
his 1
moral 1
character 1
I 1
suspect 1
him 1
of 1
being 1
untruthful 1
Algernon 1
and 1
Cecily 1
look 1
at 1
him 1
in 1
indignant 1
amazement 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Untruthful 1
My 1
nephew 1
Algernon 1
Impossible 1
He 1
is 1
an 1
Oxonian 1
Jack 1
I 1
fear 1
there 1
can 1
be 1
no 1
possible 1
doubt 1
about 1
the 1
matter 1
This 1
afternoon 1
during 1
my 1
temporary 1
absence 1
in 1
London 1
on 1
an 1
important 1
question 1
of 1
romance 1
he 1
obtained 1
admission 1
to 1
my 1
house 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
the 1
false 1
pretence 1
of 1
being 1
my 1
brother 1
Under 1
an 1
assumed 1
name 1
he 1
drank 1
I 1
ve 1
just 1
been 1
informed 1
by 1
my 1
butler 1
an 1
entire 1
pint 1
bottle 1
of 1
my 1
Perrier 1
Jouet 1
Brut 1
wine 1
I 1
was 1
specially 1
reserving 1
for 1
myself 1
Continuing 1
his 1
disgraceful 1
deception 1
he 1
succeeded 1
in 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
the 1
afternoon 1
in 1
alienating 1
the 1
affections 1
of 1
my 1
only 1
ward 1
He 1
subsequently 1
stayed 1
to 1
tea 1
and 1
devoured 1
every 1
single 1
muffin 1
And 1
what 1
makes 1
his 1
conduct 1
all 1
the 1
more 1
heartless 1
is 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
perfectly 1
well 1
aware 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
brother 1
that 1
I 1
never 1
had 1
a 1
brother 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
intend 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
brother 1
not 1
even 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
I 1
distinctly 1
told 1
him 1
so 1
myself 1
yesterday 1
afternoon 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Ahem 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
after 1
careful 1
consideration 1
I 1
have 1
decided 1
entirely 1
to 1
overlook 1
my 1
nephew 1
s 1
conduct 1
to 1
you 1
Jack 1
That 1
is 1
very 1
generous 1
of 1
you 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
My 1
own 1
decision 1
however 1
is 1
unalterable 1
I 1
decline 1
to 1
give 1
my 1
consent 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
To 1
Cecily 1
Come 1
here 1
sweet 1
child 1
Cecily 1
goes 1
over 1
How 1
old 1
are 1
you 1
dear 1
Cecily 1
Well 1
I 1
am 1
really 1
only 1
eighteen 1
but 1
I 1
always 1
admit 1
to 1
twenty 1
when 1
I 1
go 1
to 1
evening 1
parties 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
You 1
are 1
perfectly 1
right 1
in 1
making 1
some 1
slight 1
alteration 1
Indeed 1
no 1
woman 1
should 1
ever 1
be 1
quite 1
accurate 1
about 1
her 1
age 1
It 1
looks 1
so 1
calculating 1
In 1
a 1
meditative 1
manner 1
Eighteen 1
but 1
admitting 1
to 1
twenty 1
at 1
evening 1
parties 1
Well 1
it 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
very 1
long 1
before 1
you 1
are 1
of 1
age 1
and 1
free 1
from 1
the 1
restraints 1
of 1
tutelage 1
So 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
your 1
guardian 1
s 1
consent 1
is 1
after 1
all 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
any 1
importance 1
Jack 1
Pray 1
excuse 1
me 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
for 1
interrupting 1
you 1
again 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
fair 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
according 1
to 1
the 1
terms 1
of 1
her 1
grandfather 1
s 1
will 1
Miss 1
Cardew 1
does 1
not 1
come 1
legally 1
of 1
age 1
till 1
she 1
is 1
thirty 1
five 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
That 1
does 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
grave 1
objection 1
Thirty 1
five 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
attractive 1
age 1
London 1
society 1
is 1
full 1
of 1
women 1
of 1
the 1
very 1
highest 1
birth 1
who 1
have 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
free 1
choice 1
remained 1
thirty 1
five 1
for 1
years 1
Lady 1
Dumbleton 1
is 1
an 1
instance 1
in 1
point 1
To 1
my 1
own 1
knowledge 1
she 1
has 1
been 1
thirty 1
five 1
ever 1
since 1
she 1
arrived 1
at 1
the 1
age 1
of 1
forty 1
which 1
was 1
many 1
years 1
ago 1
now 1
I 1
see 1
no 1
reason 1
why 1
our 1
dear 1
Cecily 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
even 1
still 1
more 1
attractive 1
at 1
the 1
age 1
you 1
mention 1
than 1
she 1
is 1
at 1
present 1
There 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
large 1
accumulation 1
of 1
property 1
Cecily 1
Algy 1
could 1
you 1
wait 1
for 1
me 1
till 1
I 1
was 1
thirty 1
five 1
Algernon 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
could 1
Cecily 1
You 1
know 1
I 1
could 1
Cecily 1
Yes 1
I 1
felt 1
it 1
instinctively 1
but 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
wait 1
all 1
that 1
time 1
I 1
hate 1
waiting 1
even 1
five 1
minutes 1
for 1
anybody 1
It 1
always 1
makes 1
me 1
rather 1
cross 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
punctual 1
myself 1
I 1
know 1
but 1
I 1
do 1
like 1
punctuality 1
in 1
others 1
and 1
waiting 1
even 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
is 1
quite 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
question 1
Algernon 1
Then 1
what 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
Cecily 2
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
Mr 1
Moncrieff 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
My 1
dear 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
as 1
Miss 1
Cardew 1
states 1
positively 1
that 1
she 1
cannot 1
wait 1
till 1
she 1
is 1
thirty 1
five 1
a 1
remark 1
which 1
I 1
am 1
bound 1
to 1
say 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
show 1
a 1
somewhat 1
impatient 1
nature 1
I 1
would 1
beg 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
reconsider 1
your 1
decision 1
Jack 1
But 1
my 1
dear 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
the 1
matter 1
is 1
entirely 1
in 1
your 1
own 1
hands 1
The 1
moment 1
you 1
consent 1
to 1
my 1
marriage 1
with 1
Gwendolen 1
I 1
will 1
most 1
gladly 1
allow 1
your 1
nephew 1
to 1
form 1
an 1
alliance 1
with 1
my 1
ward 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Rising 1
and 1
drawing 1
herself 1
up 1
You 1
must 1
be 1
quite 1
aware 1
that 1
what 1
you 1
propose 1
is 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
question 1
Jack 1
Then 1
a 1
passionate 1
celibacy 1
is 1
all 1
that 1
any 1
of 1
us 1
can 1
look 1
forward 1
to 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
That 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
destiny 1
I 1
propose 1
for 1
Gwendolen 1
Algernon 1
of 1
course 1
can 1
choose 1
for 1
himself 1
Pulls 1
out 1
her 1
watch 1
Come 1
dear 1
Gwendolen 1
rises 1
we 1
have 1
already 1
missed 1
five 1
if 1
not 1
six 1
trains 1
To 1
miss 1
any 1
more 1
might 1
expose 1
us 1
to 1
comment 1
on 1
the 1
platform 1
Enter 1
Dr 1
Chasuble 2
Everything 1
is 1
quite 1
ready 1
for 1
the 1
christenings 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
The 1
christenings 1
sir 1
Is 1
not 1
that 1
somewhat 1
premature 1
Chasuble 1
Looking 1
rather 1
puzzled 1
and 1
pointing 1
to 1
Jack 1
and 1
Algernon 1
Both 1
these 1
gentlemen 1
have 1
expressed 1
a 1
desire 1
for 1
immediate 1
baptism 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
At 1
their 1
age 1
The 1
idea 1
is 1
grotesque 1
and 1
irreligious 1
Algernon 1
I 1
forbid 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
baptized 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
hear 1
of 1
such 1
excesses 1
Lord 1
Bracknell 1
would 1
be 1
highly 1
displeased 1
if 1
he 1
learned 1
that 2
was 1
the 1
way 1
in 1
which 1
you 1
wasted 1
your 1
time 1
and 1
money 1
Chasuble 1
Am 1
I 1
to 1
understand 1
then 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
to 1
be 1
no 1
christenings 1
at 1
all 1
this 1
afternoon 1
Jack 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
that 1
as 1
things 1
are 1
now 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
of 1
much 1
practical 1
value 1
to 1
either 1
of 1
us 1
Dr 1
Chasuble 2
I 1
am 1
grieved 1
to 1
hear 1
such 1
sentiments 1
from 1
you 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
They 1
savour 1
of 1
the 1
heretical 1
views 1
of 1
the 1
Anabaptists 1
views 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
completely 1
refuted 1
in 1
four 1
of 1
my 1
unpublished 1
sermons 1
However 1
as 1
your 1
present 1
mood 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
one 1
peculiarly 1
secular 1
I 1
will 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
church 1
at 1
once 1
Indeed 1
I 1
have 1
just 1
been 1
informed 1
by 1
the 1
pew 1
opener 1
that 1
for 1
the 1
last 1
hour 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
has 1
been 1
waiting 1
for 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
vestry 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Starting 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
Did 1
I 1
hear 1
you 1
mention 1
a 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
Chasuble 1
Yes 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
I 1
am 1
on 1
my 1
way 1
to 1
join 1
her 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Pray 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
detain 1
you 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
This 1
matter 1
may 1
prove 1
to 1
be 1
one 1
of 1
vital 1
importance 1
to 1
Lord 1
Bracknell 1
and 1
myself 1
Is 1
this 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
a 1
female 1
of 1
repellent 1
aspect 1
remotely 1
connected 1
with 1
education 1
Chasuble 1
Somewhat 1
indignantly 1
She 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
cultivated 1
of 1
ladies 1
and 1
the 1
very 1
picture 1
of 1
respectability 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
It 1
is 1
obviously 1
the 1
same 1
person 1
May 1
I 1
ask 1
what 1
position 1
she 1
holds 1
in 1
your 1
household 1

three 1
years 1
Miss 1
Cardew 1
s 1
esteemed 1
governess 1
and 1
valued 1
companion 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
In 1
spite 1
of 1
what 1
I 1
hear 1
of 1
her 1
I 1
must 1
see 1
her 1
at 1
once 1
Let 1

Enter 1
Miss 1

hurriedly 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
I 1
was 1
told 1
you 1
expected 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
vestry 1
dear 1
Canon 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
waiting 1
for 1
you 1
there 1
for 1
an 1
hour 1
and 1
three 1
quarters 1
Catches 1
sight 1
of 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
who 1
has 1
fixed 1
her 1
with 1
a 1
stony 1
glare 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
grows 1
pale 1
and 1
quails 1
She 1
looks 1
anxiously 1
round 1
as 1
if 1
desirous 1
to 1
escape 1
Lady 1

In 1

consternation 1
The 1
Canon 1
starts 1
back 1
in 1
horror 1
Algernon 1
and 1
Jack 1
pretend 1
to 1
be 1
anxious 1
to 1
shield 1
Cecily 1
and 1
Gwendolen 1
from 1
hearing 1
the 1
details 1
of 1
a 1
terrible 1
public 1
scandal 1
Twenty 1
eight 1
years 1
ago 1
Prism 1
you 1
left 1
Lord 1
Bracknell 1
s 1
house 1
Number 1
Upper 1
Grosvenor 1
Street 1
in 1
charge 1
of 1
a 1
perambulator 1
that 1
contained 1
a 1
baby 1
of 1
the 1
male 1
sex 1
You 1
never 1
returned 1
A 1
few 1
weeks 1
later 1
through 1
the 1
elaborate 1
investigations 1
of 1
the 1
Metropolitan 1
police 1
the 1
perambulator 1
was 1
discovered 1
at 1
midnight 1
standing 1
by 1
itself 1
in 1
a 1
remote 1
corner 1
of 1
Bayswater 1
It 1
contained 1
the 1
manuscript 1
of 1
a 1
three 1
volume 1
novel 1
of 1
more 1
than 1
usually 1
revolting 1
sentimentality 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
starts 1
in 1
involuntary 1
indignation 1
But 1
the 1
baby 1
was 1
not 1
there 1
Every 1
one 1
looks 1
at 1
Miss 1
Prism 2
Where 1
is 1
that 1
baby 1
A 1
pause 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
I 1
admit 1
with 1
shame 1
that 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
I 1
only 1
wish 1
I 1
did 1
The 1
plain 1
facts 1
of 1
the 1
case 1
are 1
these 1
On 1
the 1
morning 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
you 1
mention 1
a 1
day 1
that 1
is 1
for 1
ever 1
branded 1
on 1
my 1
memory 1
I 1
prepared 1
as 1
usual 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
baby 1
out 1
in 1
its 1
perambulator 1
I 1
had 1
also 1
with 1
me 1
a 1
somewhat 1
old 1
but 1
capacious 1
hand 1
bag 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
intended 1
to 1
place 1
the 1
manuscript 1
of 1
a 1
work 1
of 1
fiction 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
written 1
during 1
my 1
few 1
unoccupied 1
hours 1
In 1
a 1
moment 1
of 1
mental 1
abstraction 1
for 1
which 1
I 1
never 1
can 1
forgive 1
myself 1
I 1
deposited 1
the 1
manuscript 1
in 1
the 1
basinette 1
and 1
placed 1
the 1
baby 1
in 1
the 1
hand 1
bag 1
Jack 1
Who 1
has 1
been 1
listening 1
attentively 1
But 1
where 1
did 1
you 1
deposit 1
the 1
hand 1
bag 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
Do 1
not 1
ask 1
me 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
Jack 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
no 1
small 1
importance 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
insist 1
on 1
knowing 1
where 1
you 1
deposited 1
the 1
hand 1
bag 1
that 1
contained 1
that 1
infant 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
I 1
left 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
cloak 1
room 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
larger 1
railway 1
stations 1
in 1
London 1

What 1
railway 1

Quite 1
crushed 1

The 1
Brighton 1

Sinks 1

a 1
chair 1
Jack 1
I 1
must 1
retire 1
to 1
my 1
room 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
Gwendolen 1
wait 1
here 1
for 1
me 1
Gwendolen 1
If 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
too 1
long 1
I 1
will 1
wait 1
here 1
for 1
you 1
all 1
my 1
life 1
Exit 1
Jack 1
in 1
great 1
excitement 1
Chasuble 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
this 1
means 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
I 1
dare 1
not 1
even 1
suspect 1
Dr 1
Chasuble 1
I 1
need 1
hardly 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
in 1
families 1
of 1
high 1
position 1
strange 1
coincidences 1
are 1
not 1
supposed 1
to 1
occur 1
They 1
are 1
hardly 1
considered 1
the 1
thing 1
Noises 1
heard 1
overhead 1
as 1
if 1
some 1
one 1
was 1
throwing 1
trunks 1
about 1
Every 1
one 1
looks 1
up 1
Cecily 1
Uncle 1
Jack 1
seems 1
strangely 1
agitated 1
Chasuble 1
Your 1
guardian 1
has 1
a 1
very 1
emotional 1
nature 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
This 1
noise 1
is 1
extremely 1
unpleasant 1
It 1
sounds 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
having 1
an 1
argument 1
I 1
dislike 1
arguments 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
They 1
are 1
always 1
vulgar 1
and 1
often 1
convincing 1
Chasuble 1
Looking 1
up 1
It 1
has 1
stopped 1
now 1
The 1
noise 1
is 1
redoubled 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
I 1
wish 1
he 1
would 1
arrive 1
at 1
some 1
conclusion 1
Gwendolen 1
This 1
suspense 1
is 1
terrible 1
I 1
hope 1
it 1
will 1
last 1
Enter 1
Jack 1
with 1
a 1
hand 1
bag 1
of 1
black 1
leather 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
Jack 1
Rushing 1
over 1
to 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
Is 1
this 1
the 1
hand 1
bag 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
Examine 1
it 1
carefully 1
before 1
you 1
speak 1
The 1
happiness 1
of 1
more 1
than 1
one 1
life 1
depends 1
on 1
your 1
answer 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
Calmly 1
It 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
mine 1
Yes 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
injury 1
it 1
received 1
through 1
the 1
upsetting 1
of 1
a 1
Gower 1
Street 1
omnibus 1
in 1
younger 1
and 1
happier 1
days 1
Here 1
is 1
the 1
stain 1
on 1
the 1
lining 1
caused 1
by 1
the 1
explosion 1
of 1
a 1
temperance 1
beverage 1
an 1
incident 1
that 1
occurred 1
at 1
Leamington 1
And 1
here 1
on 1
the 1
lock 1
are 1
my 1
initials 1
I 1
had 1
forgotten 1
that 1
in 1
an 1
extravagant 1
mood 1
I 1
had 2
them 1
placed 1
there 1
The 1
bag 1
is 1
undoubtedly 1
mine 1
I 1
am 1
delighted 1
to 1
have 1
it 1
so 1
unexpectedly 1
restored 1
to 1
me 1
It 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
great 1
inconvenience 1
being 1
without 1
it 1
all 1
these 1
years 1
Jack 1
In 1
a 1
pathetic 1
voice 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
more 1
is 1
restored 1
to 1
you 1
than 1
this 1
hand 1
bag 1
I 1
was 1
the 1
baby 1
you 1
placed 1
in 1
it 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
Amazed 1
You 1
Jack 1
Embracing 1
her 1
Yes 1
mother 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
Recoiling 1
in 1
indignant 1
astonishment 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
I 1
am 1
unmarried 1
Jack 1
Unmarried 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
deny 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
serious 1
blow 1
But 1
after 1
all 1
who 1
has 1
the 1
right 1
to 1
cast 1
a 1
stone 1
against 1
one 1
who 1
has 1
suffered 1
Cannot 1
repentance 1
wipe 1
out 1
an 1
act 1
of 1
folly 1
Why 1
should 1
there 1
be 1
one 1
law 1
for 1
men 1
and 1
another 1
for 1
women 1
Mother 1
I 1
forgive 1
you 1
Tries 1
to 1
embrace 1
her 1
again 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
Still 1
more 1
indignant 1
Mr 1
Worthing 1
there 1
is 1
some 1
error 1
Pointing 1
to 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
There 1
is 1
the 1
lady 1
who 1
can 1
tell 1
you 1
who 1
you 1
really 1
are 1
Jack 1
After 1
a 1
pause 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
I 1
hate 1
to 1
seem 1
inquisitive 1
but 1
would 1
you 1
kindly 1
inform 1
me 1
who 1
I 1
am 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
the 1
news 1
I 1
have 1
to 1
give 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
altogether 1
please 1
you 1
You 1
are 1
the 1
son 1
of 1
my 1
poor 1
sister 1
Mrs 1
Moncrieff 1
and 1
consequently 1
Algernon 1
s 1
elder 1
brother 1
Jack 1
Algy 1
s 1
elder 1
brother 1
Then 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
brother 1
after 1
all 1
I 1
knew 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
brother 1
I 1
always 1
said 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
brother 1
Cecily 1
how 1
could 1
you 1
have 1
ever 1
doubted 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
brother 1
Seizes 1
hold 1
of 1
Algernon 1
Dr 1
Chasuble 1
my 1
unfortunate 1
brother 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
my 1
unfortunate 1
brother 1
Gwendolen 1
my 1
unfortunate 1
brother 1
Algy 1
you 1
young 1
scoundrel 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
to 1
treat 1
me 1
with 1
more 1
respect 1
in 1
the 1
future 1
You 1
have 1
never 1
behaved 1
to 1
me 1
like 1
a 1
brother 1
in 1
all 1
your 1
life 1
Algernon 1
Well 1
not 1
till 1
to 1
day 1
old 1
boy 1
I 1
admit 1
I 1
did 1
my 1
best 1
however 1
though 1
I 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
practice 1
Shakes 1
hands 1
Gwendolen 1
To 1
Jack 1
My 1
own 1
But 1
what 1
own 1
are 1
you 1
What 1
is 1
your 1
Christian 1
name 1
now 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
become 1
some 1
one 1
else 1
Jack 1
Good 1
heavens 1
I 1
had 1
quite 1
forgotten 1
that 1
point 1
Your 1
decision 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
of 1
my 1
name 1
is 1
irrevocable 1
I 1
suppose 1
Gwendolen 1
I 1
never 1
change 1
except 1
in 1
my 1
affections 1
Cecily 1
What 1
a 1
noble 1
nature 1
you 1
have 1
Gwendolen 1
Jack 1
Then 1
the 1
question 1
had 1
better 1
be 1
cleared 1
up 1
at 1
once 1
Aunt 1
Augusta 1
a 1
moment 1
At 1
the 1
time 1
when 1
Miss 1
Prism 1
left 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
hand 1
bag 1
had 1
I 1
been 1
christened 1
already 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Every 1
luxury 1
that 1
money 1
could 1
buy 1
including 1
christening 1
had 1
been 1
lavished 1
on 1
you 1
by 1
your 1
fond 1
and 1
doting 1
parents 1
Jack 1
Then 1
I 1
was 1
christened 1
That 1
is 1
settled 1
Now 1
what 1
name 1
was 1
I 1
given 1
Let 1
me 1
know 1
the 1
worst 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Being 1
the 1
eldest 1
son 1
you 1
were 1
naturally 1
christened 1
after 1
your 1
father 1
Jack 1
Irritably 1
Yes 1
but 1
what 1
was 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
Christian 1
name 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
Meditatively 1
I 1
cannot 1
at 1
the 1
present 1
moment 1
recall 1
what 1
the 1
General 1
s 1
Christian 1
name 1
was 1
But 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
he 1
had 1
one 1
He 1
was 1
eccentric 1
I 1
admit 1
But 1
only 1
in 1
later 1
years 1
And 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
the 1
Indian 1
climate 1
and 1
marriage 1
and 1
indigestion 1
and 1
other 1
things 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
Jack 1
Algy 1
Can 1
t 1
you 1
recollect 1
what 1
our 1
father 1
s 1
Christian 1
name 1
was 1
Algernon 1
My 1
dear 1
boy 1
we 1
were 1
never 1
even 1
on 1
speaking 1
terms 1
He 1
died 1
before 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
year 1
old 1
Jack 1
His 1
name 1
would 1
appear 1
in 1
the 1
Army 1
Lists 1
of 1
the 1
period 1
I 1
suppose 1
Aunt 1
Augusta 1
Lady 1
Bracknell 1
The 1
General 1
was 1
essentially 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
peace 1
except 1
in 1
his 1
domestic 1
life 1
But 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
his 1
name 1
would 1
appear 1
in 1
any 1
military 1
directory 1
Jack 1
The 1
Army 1
Lists 1
of 1
the 1
last 1
forty 1
years 1

delightful 1

Gwendolen 1
my 1

Well 1
it 1
