I 1
One 1
morning 1
when 1
Gregor 1
Samsa 1
woke 1
from 1
troubled 1
dreams 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
transformed 1
in 1
his 1
bed 1
into 1
a 1
horrible 1
vermin 1
He 1
lay 1
on 1
his 1
armour 1
like 1
back 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
lifted 1
his 1
head 1
a 1
little 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
his 1
brown 1
belly 1
slightly 1
domed 1
and 1
divided 1
by 1
arches 1
into 1
stiff 1
sections 1
The 1
bedding 1
was 1
hardly 1
able 1
to 1
cover 1
it 1
and 1
seemed 1
ready 1
to 1
slide 1
off 1
any 1
moment 1
His 1
many 1
legs 1
pitifully 1
thin 1
compared 1
with 1
the 1
size 1
of 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
him 1
waved 1
about 1
helplessly 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
What 1
s 1
happened 1
to 1
me 1
he 1
thought 1
It 1
wasn 1
t 1
a 1
dream 1
His 1
room 1
a 1
proper 1
human 1
room 1
although 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
small 1
lay 1
peacefully 1
between 1
its 1
four 1
familiar 1
walls 1
A 1
collection 1
of 1
textile 1
samples 1
lay 1
spread 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
Samsa 1
was 1
a 1
travelling 1
salesman 1
and 1
above 1
it 1
there 1
hung 1
a 1
picture 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
recently 1
cut 1
out 1
of 1
an 1
illustrated 1
magazine 1
and 1
housed 1
in 1
a 1
nice 1
gilded 1
frame 1
It 1
showed 1
a 1
lady 1
fitted 1
out 1
with 1
a 1
fur 1
hat 1
and 1
fur 1
boa 1
who 1
sat 1
upright 1
raising 1
a 1
heavy 1
fur 1
muff 1
that 1
covered 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
her 1
lower 1
arm 1
towards 1
the 1
viewer 1
Gregor 1
then 1
turned 1
to 1
look 1
out 1
the 1
window 1
at 1
the 1
dull 1
weather 1
Drops 1
of 1
rain 1
could 1
be 1
heard 1
hitting 1
the 1
pane 1
which 1
made 1
him 1
feel 1
quite 1
sad 1
How 1
about 1
if 1
I 1
sleep 1
a 1
little 1
bit 1
longer 1
and 1
forget 1
all 1
this 1
nonsense 1
he 1
thought 1
but 1
that 1
was 1
something 1
he 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
do 1
because 1
he 1
was 1
used 1
to 1
sleeping 1
on 1
his 1
right 1
and 1
in 1
his 1
present 1
state 1
couldn 1
t 1
get 1
into 1
that 1
position 1
However 1
hard 1
he 1
threw 1
himself 1
onto 1
his 1
right 1
he 1
always 1
rolled 1
back 1
to 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
He 1
must 1
have 1
tried 1
it 1
a 1
hundred 1
times 1
shut 1
his 1
eyes 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
have 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
floundering 1
legs 1
and 1
only 1
stopped 1
when 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
a 1
mild 1
dull 1
pain 1
there 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
felt 1
before 1
Oh 1
God 1
he 1
thought 1
what 1
a 1
strenuous 1
career 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
I 1
ve 1
chosen 1
Travelling 1
day 1
in 1
and 1
day 1
out 1
Doing 1
business 1
like 1
this 1
takes 1
much 1
more 1
effort 1
than 1
doing 1
your 1
own 1
business 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
on 1
top 1
of 1
that 1
there 1
s 1
the 1
curse 1
of 1
travelling 1
worries 1
about 1
making 1
train 1
connections 1
bad 1
and 1
irregular 1
food 1
contact 1
with 1
different 1
people 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
so 1
that 1
you 1
can 1
never 1
get 1
to 1
know 1
anyone 1
or 1
become 1
friendly 1
with 1
them 1
It 1
can 1
all 1
go 1
to 1
Hell 1
He 1
felt 1
a 1
slight 1
itch 1
up 1
on 1
his 1
belly 1
pushed 1
himself 1
slowly 1
up 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
towards 1
the 1
headboard 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
lift 1
his 1
head 1
better 1
found 1
where 1
the 1
itch 1
was 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
covered 1
with 1
lots 1
of 1
little 1
white 1
spots 1
which 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
make 1
of 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
feel 1
the 1
place 1
with 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
legs 1
he 1
drew 1
it 1
quickly 1
back 1
because 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
touched 1
it 1
he 1
was 1
overcome 1
by 1
a 1
cold 1
shudder 1
He 1
slid 1
back 1
into 1
his 1
former 1
position 1
Getting 1
up 1
early 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
he 1
thought 1
it 1
makes 1
you 1
stupid 1
You 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
get 1
enough 1
sleep 1
Other 1
travelling 1
salesmen 1
live 1
a 1
life 1
of 1
luxury 1
For 1
instance 1
whenever 1
I 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
guest 1
house 1
during 1
the 1
morning 1
to 1
copy 1
out 1
the 1
contract 1
these 1
gentlemen 1
are 1
always 1
still 1
sitting 1
there 1
eating 1
their 1
breakfasts 1
I 1
ought 1
to 1
just 1
try 1
that 1
with 1
my 1
boss 1
I 1
d 1
get 1
kicked 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
spot 1
But 1
who 1
knows 1
maybe 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
best 1
thing 1
for 1
me 1
If 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
have 1
my 1
parents 1
to 1
think 1
about 1
I 1
d 1
have 1
given 1
in 1
my 1
notice 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
ago 1
I 1
d 1
have 1
gone 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
boss 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
just 1
what 1
I 1
think 1
tell 1
him 1
everything 1
I 1
would 1
let 1
him 1
know 1
just 1
what 1
I 1
feel 1
He 1
d 1
fall 1
right 1
off 1
his 1
desk 1
And 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
funny 1
sort 1
of 1
business 1
to 1
be 1
sitting 1
up 1
there 1
at 1
your 1
desk 1
talking 1
down 1
at 1
your 1
subordinates 1
from 1
up 1
there 1
especially 1
when 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
right 1
up 1
close 1
because 1
the 1
boss 1
is 1
hard 1
of 1
hearing 1
Well 1
there 1
s 1
still 1
some 1
hope 1
once 1
I 1
ve 1
got 1
the 1
money 1
together 1
to 1
pay 1
off 1
my 1
parents 1
debt 1
to 1
him 1
another 1
five 1
or 1
six 1
years 1
I 1
suppose 1
that 1
s 1
definitely 1
what 1
I 1
ll 1
do 1
That 1
s 1
when 1
I 1
ll 1
make 1
the 1
big 1
change 1
First 1
of 1
all 1
though 1
I 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
my 1
train 1
leaves 1
at 1
five 1
And 1
he 1
looked 1
over 1
at 1
the 1
alarm 1
clock 1
ticking 1
on 1
the 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
God 1
in 1
Heaven 1
he 1
thought 1
It 1
was 1
half 1
past 1
six 1
and 1
the 1
hands 1
were 1
quietly 1
moving 1
forwards 1
it 1
was 1
even 1
later 1
than 1
half 1
past 1
more 1
like 1
quarter 1
to 1
seven 1
Had 1
the 1
alarm 1
clock 1
not 1
rung 1
He 1
could 1
see 1
from 1
the 1
bed 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
set 1
for 1
four 1
o 1
clock 1
as 1
it 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
it 1
certainly 1
must 1
have 1
rung 1
Yes 1
but 1
was 1
it 1
possible 1
to 1
quietly 1
sleep 1
through 1
that 1
furniture 1
rattling 1
noise 1
True 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
slept 1
peacefully 1
but 1
probably 1
all 1
the 1
more 1
deeply 1
because 1
of 1
that 1
What 1
should 1
he 1
do 1
now 1
The 1
next 1
train 1
went 1
at 1
seven 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
to 1
catch 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
rush 1
like 1
mad 1
and 1
the 1
collection 1
of 1
samples 1
was 1
still 1
not 1
packed 1
and 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
feel 1
particularly 1
fresh 1
and 1
lively 1
And 1
even 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
catch 1
the 1
train 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
avoid 1
his 1
boss 1
s 1
anger 1
as 1
the 1
office 1
assistant 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
there 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
five 1
o 1
clock 1
train 1
go 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
put 1
in 1
his 1
report 1
about 1
Gregor 1
s 1
not 1
being 1
there 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
ago 1
The 1
office 1
assistant 1
was 1
the 1
boss 1
s 1
man 1
spineless 1
and 1
with 1
no 1
understanding 1
What 1
about 1
if 1
he 1
reported 1
sick 1
But 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
extremely 1
strained 1
and 1
suspicious 1
as 1
in 1
fifteen 1
years 1
of 1
service 1
Gregor 1
had 1
never 1
once 1
yet 1
been 1
ill 1
His 1
boss 1
would 1
certainly 1
come 1
round 1
with 1
the 1
doctor 1
from 1
the 1
medical 1
insurance 1
company 1
accuse 1
his 1
parents 1
of 1
having 1
a 1
lazy 1
son 1
and 1
accept 1
the 1
doctor 1
s 1
recommendation 1
not 1
to 1
make 1
any 1
claim 1
as 1
the 1
doctor 1
believed 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
was 1
ever 1
ill 1
but 1
that 1
many 1
were 1
workshy 1
And 1
what 1
s 1
more 1
would 1
he 1
have 1
been 1
entirely 1
wrong 1
in 1
this 1
case 1
Gregor 1
did 1
in 1
fact 1
apart 1
from 1
excessive 1
sleepiness 1
after 1
sleeping 1
for 1
so 1
long 1
feel 1
completely 1
well 1
and 1
even 1
felt 1
much 1
hungrier 1
than 1
usual 1
He 1
was 1
still 1
hurriedly 1
thinking 1
all 1
this 1
through 1
unable 1
to 1
decide 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
when 1
the 1
clock 1
struck 1
quarter 1
to 1
seven 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
cautious 1
knock 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
near 1
his 1
head 1
Gregor 1
somebody 1
called 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
mother 1
it 1
s 1
quarter 1
to 1
seven 1
Didn 1
t 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
somewhere 1
That 1
gentle 1
voice 1
Gregor 1
was 1
shocked 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
his 1
own 1
voice 1
answering 1
it 1
could 1
hardly 1
be 1
recognised 1
as 1
the 1
voice 1
he 1
had 2
before 1
As 1
if 1
from 1
deep 1
inside 1
him 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
painful 1
and 1
uncontrollable 1
squeaking 1
mixed 1
in 1
with 1
it 1
the 1
words 1
could 1
be 1
made 1
out 1
at 1
first 1
but 1
then 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
echo 1
which 1
made 1
them 1
unclear 1
leaving 1
the 1
hearer 1
unsure 1
whether 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
properly 1
or 1
not 1
Gregor 1
had 1
wanted 1
to 1
give 1
a 1
full 1
answer 1
and 1
explain 1
everything 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
circumstances 1
contented 1
himself 1
with 1
saying 1
Yes 1
mother 1
yes 1
thank 1
you 1
I 1
m 1
getting 1
up 1
now 1
The 1
change 1
in 1
Gregor 1
s 1
voice 1
probably 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
noticed 1
outside 1
through 1
the 1
wooden 1
door 1
as 1
his 1
mother 1
was 1
satisfied 1
with 1
this 1
explanation 1
and 1
shuffled 1
away 1
But 1
this 1
short 1
conversation 1
made 1
the 1
other 1
members 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
aware 1
that 1
Gregor 1
against 1
their 1
expectations 1
was 1
still 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
soon 1
his 1
father 1
came 1
knocking 1
at 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
side 1
doors 1
gently 1
but 1
with 1
his 1
fist 1
Gregor 2
he 1
called 1
what 1
s 1
wrong 1
And 1
after 1
a 1
short 1
while 1
he 1
called 1
again 1
with 1
a 1
warning 1
deepness 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
Gregor 2
At 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
door 1
his 1
sister 1
came 1
plaintively 1
Gregor 1
Aren 1
t 1
you 1
well 1
Do 1
you 1
need 1
anything 1
Gregor 1
answered 1
to 1
both 1
sides 1
I 1
m 1
ready 1
now 1
making 1
an 1
effort 1
to 1
remove 1
all 1
the 1
strangeness 1
from 1
his 1
voice 1
by 1
enunciating 1
very 1
carefully 1
and 1
putting 1
long 1
pauses 1
between 1
each 1
individual 1
word 1
His 1
father 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
breakfast 1
but 1
his 1
sister 1
whispered 1
Gregor 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
I 1
beg 1
of 1
you 1
Gregor 1
however 1
had 1
no 1
thought 1
of 1
opening 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
instead 1
congratulated 1
himself 1
for 1
his 1
cautious 1
habit 1
acquired 1
from 1
his 1
travelling 1
of 1
locking 1
all 1
doors 1
at 1
night 1
even 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
home 1
The 1
first 1
thing 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
do 1
was 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
in 1
peace 1
without 1
being 1
disturbed 1
to 1
get 1
dressed 1
and 1
most 1
of 1
all 1
to 1
have 1
his 1
breakfast 1
Only 1
then 1
would 1
he 1
consider 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
next 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
well 1
aware 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
bring 1
his 1
thoughts 1
to 1
any 1
sensible 1
conclusions 1
by 1
lying 1
in 1
bed 1
He 1
remembered 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
often 1
felt 1
a 1
slight 1
pain 1
in 1
bed 1
perhaps 1
caused 1
by 1
lying 1
awkwardly 1
but 1
that 1
had 1
always 1
turned 1
out 1
to 1
be 1
pure 1
imagination 1
and 1
he 1
wondered 1
how 1
his 1
imaginings 1
would 1
slowly 1
resolve 1
themselves 1
today 1
He 1
did 1
not 1
have 1
the 1
slightest 1
doubt 1
that 1
the 1
change 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
was 1
nothing 1
more 1
than 1
the 1
first 1
sign 1
of 1
a 1
serious 1
cold 1
which 1
was 1
an 1
occupational 1
hazard 1
for 1
travelling 1
salesmen 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
simple 1
matter 1
to 1
throw 1
off 1
the 1
covers 1
he 1
only 1
had 1
to 1
blow 1
himself 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
they 1
fell 1
off 1
by 1
themselves 1
But 1
it 1
became 1
difficult 1
after 1
that 1
especially 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
exceptionally 1
broad 1
He 1
would 1
have 1
used 1
his 1
arms 1
and 1
his 1
hands 1
to 1
push 1
himself 1
up 1
but 1
instead 1
of 1
them 1
he 1
only 1
had 1
all 1
those 1
little 1
legs 1
continuously 1
moving 1
in 1
different 1
directions 1
and 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
moreover 1
unable 1
to 1
control 1
If 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
bend 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
then 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
one 1
that 1
would 1
stretch 1
itself 1
out 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
finally 1
managed 1
to 1
do 1
what 1
he 1
wanted 1
with 1
that 1
leg 1
all 1
the 1
others 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
set 1
free 1
and 1
would 1
move 1
about 1
painfully 1
This 1
is 1
something 1
that 1
can 1
t 1
be 1
done 1
in 1
bed 1
Gregor 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
so 1
don 1
t 1
keep 1
trying 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
The 1
first 1
thing 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
do 1
was 1
get 1
the 1
lower 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
this 1
lower 1
part 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
imagine 1
what 1
it 1
looked 1
like 1
it 1
turned 1
out 1
to 1
be 1
too 1
hard 1
to 1
move 1
it 1
went 1
so 1
slowly 1
and 1
finally 1
almost 1
in 1
a 1
frenzy 1
when 1
he 1
carelessly 1
shoved 1
himself 1
forwards 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
force 1
he 1
could 1
gather 1
he 1
chose 1
the 1
wrong 1
direction 1
hit 1
hard 1
against 1
the 1
lower 1
bedpost 1
and 1
learned 1
from 1
the 1
burning 1
pain 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
the 1
lower 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
might 1
well 1
at 1
present 1
be 1
the 1
most 1
sensitive 1
So 1
then 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
top 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
first 1
carefully 1
turning 1
his 1
head 1
to 1
the 1
side 1
This 1
he 1
managed 1
quite 1
easily 1
and 1
despite 1
its 1
breadth 1
and 1
its 1
weight 1
the 1
bulk 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
eventually 1
followed 1
slowly 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
head 1
But 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
at 1
last 1
got 1
his 1
head 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
and 1
into 1
the 1
fresh 1
air 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
if 1
he 1
let 1
himself 1
fall 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
miracle 1
if 1
his 1
head 1
were 1
not 1
injured 1
so 1
he 1
became 1
afraid 1
to 1
carry 1
on 1
pushing 1
himself 1
forward 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
And 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
knock 1
himself 1
out 1
now 1
at 1
any 1
price 1
better 1
to 1
stay 1
in 1
bed 1
than 1
lose 1
consciousness 1
It 1
took 1
just 1
as 1
much 1
effort 1
to 1
get 1
back 1
to 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
earlier 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
lay 1
there 1
sighing 1
and 1
was 1
once 1
more 1
watching 1
his 1
legs 1
as 1
they 1
struggled 1
against 1
each 1
other 1
even 1
harder 1
than 1
before 1
if 1
that 1
was 1
possible 1
he 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
no 1
way 1
of 1
bringing 1
peace 1
and 1
order 1
to 1
this 1
chaos 1
He 1
told 1
himself 1
once 1
more 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
possible 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
stay 1
in 1
bed 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
most 1
sensible 1
thing 1
to 1
do 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
get 1
free 1
of 1
it 1
in 1
whatever 1
way 1
he 1
could 1
at 1
whatever 1
sacrifice 1
At 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
though 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
forget 1
to 1
remind 1
himself 1
that 1
calm 1
consideration 1
was 1
much 1
better 1
than 1
rushing 1
to 1
desperate 1
conclusions 1
At 1
times 1
like 1
this 1
he 1
would 1
direct 1
his 1
eyes 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
look 1
out 1
as 1
clearly 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
but 1
unfortunately 1
even 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
narrow 1
street 1
was 1
enveloped 1
in 1
morning 1
fog 1
and 1
the 1
view 1
had 1
little 1
confidence 1
or 1
cheer 1
to 1
offer 1
him 1
Seven 1
o 1
clock 1
already 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
when 1
the 1
clock 1
struck 1
again 1
seven 1
o 1
clock 1
and 1
there 1
s 1
still 1
a 1
fog 1
like 1
this 1
And 1
he 1
lay 1
there 1
quietly 1
a 1
while 1
longer 1
breathing 1
lightly 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
perhaps 1
expected 1
the 1
total 1
stillness 1
to 1
bring 1
things 1
back 1
to 1
their 1
real 1
and 1
natural 1
state 1
But 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
Before 1
it 1
strikes 1
quarter 1
past 1
seven 1
I 1
ll 1
definitely 1
have 1
to 1
have 1
got 1
properly 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
And 1
by 1
then 1
somebody 1
will 1
have 1
come 1
round 1
from 1
work 1
to 1
ask 1
what 1
s 1
happened 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
they 1
open 1
up 1
at 1
work 1
before 1
seven 1
o 1
clock 1
And 1
so 1
he 1
set 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
task 1
of 1
swinging 1
the 1
entire 1
length 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
all 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
If 1
he 1
succeeded 1
in 1
falling 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
kept 1
his 1
head 1
raised 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
so 1
he 1
could 1
probably 1
avoid 1
injuring 1
it 1
His 1
back 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
quite 1
hard 1
and 1
probably 1
nothing 1
would 1
happen 1
to 1
it 1
falling 1
onto 1
the 1
carpet 1
His 1
main 1
concern 1
was 1
for 1
the 1
loud 1
noise 1
he 1
was 1
bound 1
to 1
make 1
and 1
which 1
even 1
through 1
all 1
the 1
doors 1
would 1
probably 1
raise 1
concern 1
if 1
not 1
alarm 1
But 1
it 1
was 1
something 1
that 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
risked 1
When 1
Gregor 1
was 1
already 1
sticking 1
half 1
way 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
the 1
new 1
method 1
was 1
more 1
of 1
a 1
game 1
than 1
an 1
effort 1
all 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
was 1
rock 1
back 1
and 1
forth 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
how 1
simple 1
everything 1
would 1
be 1
if 1
somebody 1
came 1
to 1
help 1
him 1
Two 1
strong 1
people 1
he 1
had 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
the 1
maid 1
in 1
mind 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
more 1
than 1
enough 1
they 1
would 1
only 1
have 1
to 1
push 1
their 1
arms 1
under 1
the 1
dome 1
of 1
his 1
back 1
peel 1
him 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
bed 1
bend 1
down 1
with 1
the 1
load 1
and 1
then 1
be 1
patient 1
and 1
careful 1
as 1
he 1
swang 1
over 1
onto 1
the 1
floor 1
where 1
hopefully 1
the 1
little 1
legs 1
would 1
find 1
a 1
use 1
Should 1
he 1
really 1
call 1
for 1
help 1
though 1
even 1
apart 1
from 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
doors 1
were 1
locked 1
Despite 1
all 1
the 1
difficulty 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
suppress 1
a 1
smile 1
at 1
this 1
thought 1
After 1
a 1
while 1
he 1
had 1
already 1
moved 1
so 1
far 1
across 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
hard 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
keep 1
his 1
balance 1
if 1
he 1
rocked 1
too 1
hard 1
The 1
time 1
was 1
now 1
ten 1
past 1
seven 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
final 1
decision 1
very 1
soon 1
Then 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
ring 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
flat 1
That 1
ll 1
be 1
someone 1
from 1
work 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
and 1
froze 1
very 1
still 1
although 1
his 1
little 1
legs 1
only 1
became 1
all 1
the 1
more 1
lively 1
as 1
they 1
danced 1
around 1
For 1
a 1
moment 1
everything 1
remained 1
quiet 1
They 1
re 1
not 1
opening 1
the 1
door 1
Gregor 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
caught 1
in 1
some 1
nonsensical 1
hope 1
But 1
then 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
maid 1
s 1
firm 1
steps 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
as 1
ever 1
and 1
opened 1
it 1
Gregor 1
only 1
needed 1
to 1
hear 1
the 1
visitor 1
s 1
first 1
words 1
of 1
greeting 1
and 1
he 1
knew 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
himself 1
Why 1
did 1
Gregor 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
condemned 1
to 1
work 1
for 1
a 1
company 1
where 1
they 1
immediately 1
became 1
highly 1
suspicious 1
at 1
the 1
slightest 1
shortcoming 1
Were 1
all 1
employees 1
every 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
louts 1
was 1
there 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
who 1
was 1
faithful 1
and 1
devoted 1
who 1
would 1
go 1
so 1
mad 1
with 1
pangs 1
of 1
conscience 1
that 1
he 1
couldn 1
t 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
if 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
spend 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
hours 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
on 1
company 1
business 1
Was 1
it 1
really 1
not 1
enough 1
to 1
let 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
trainees 1
make 1
enquiries 1
assuming 1
enquiries 1
were 1
even 1
necessary 1
did 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
have 1
to 1
come 1
himself 1
and 1
did 1
they 1
have 1
to 1
show 1
the 1
whole 1
innocent 1
family 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
so 1
suspicious 1
that 1
only 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
could 1
be 1
trusted 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
wisdom 1
to 1
investigate 1
it 1
And 1
more 1
because 1
these 1
thoughts 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
upset 1
than 1
through 1
any 1
proper 1
decision 1
he 1
swang 1
himself 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
force 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
loud 1
thump 1
but 1
it 1
wasn 1
t 1
really 1
a 1
loud 1
noise 1
His 1
fall 1
was 1
softened 1
a 1
little 1
by 1
the 1
carpet 1
and 1
Gregor 1
s 1
back 1
was 1
also 1
more 1
elastic 1
than 1
he 1
had 1
thought 1
which 1
made 1
the 1
sound 1
muffled 1
and 1
not 1
too 1
noticeable 1
He 1
had 1
not 1
held 1
his 1
head 1
carefully 1
enough 1
though 1
and 1
hit 1
it 1
as 1
he 1
fell 1
annoyed 1
and 1
in 1
pain 1
he 1
turned 1
it 1
and 1
rubbed 1
it 1
against 1
the 1
carpet 1
Something 1
s 1
fallen 1
down 1
in 1
there 1
said 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
on 1
the 1
left 1
Gregor 1
tried 1
to 1
imagine 1
whether 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
that 1
had 1
happened 1
to 1
him 1
today 1
could 1
ever 1
happen 1
to 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
too 1
you 1
had 1
to 1
concede 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
possible 1
But 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
gruff 1
reply 1
to 1
this 1
question 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
s 1
firm 1
footsteps 1
in 1
his 1
highly 1
polished 1
boots 1
could 1
now 1
be 1
heard 1
in 1
the 1
adjoining 1
room 1
From 1
the 1
room 1
on 1
his 1
right 1
Gregor 1
s 1
sister 1
whispered 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
let 1
him 1
know 1
Gregor 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
is 1
here 1
Yes 1
I 1
know 1
said 1
Gregor 1
to 1
himself 1
but 1
without 1
daring 1
to 1
raise 1
his 1
voice 1
loud 1
enough 1
for 1
his 1
sister 1
to 1
hear 1
him 1
Gregor 1
said 1
his 1
father 1
now 1
from 1
the 1
room 1
to 1
his 1
left 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
has 1
come 1
round 1
and 1
wants 1
to 1
know 1
why 1
you 1
didn 1
t 1
leave 1
on 1
the 1
early 1
train 1
We 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
to 1
him 1
And 1
anyway 1
he 1
wants 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
you 1
personally 1
So 1
please 1
open 1
up 1
this 1
door 1
I 1
m 1
sure 1
he 1
ll 1
be 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
forgive 1
the 1
untidiness 1
of 1
your 1
room 1
Then 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
called 1
Good 1
morning 1
Mr 1
Samsa 1
He 1
isn 1
t 1
well 1
said 1
his 1
mother 1
to 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
while 1
his 1
father 1
continued 1
to 1
speak 1
through 1
the 1
door 1
He 1
isn 1
t 1
well 1
please 1
believe 1
me 1
Why 1
else 1
would 1
Gregor 1
have 1
missed 1
a 1
train 1
The 1
lad 1
only 1
ever 1
thinks 1
about 1
the 1
business 1
It 1
nearly 1
makes 1
me 1
cross 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
never 1
goes 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
evenings 1
he 1
s 1
been 1
in 1
town 1
for 1
a 1
week 1
now 1
but 1
stayed 1
home 1
every 1
evening 1
He 1
sits 1
with 1
us 1
in 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
just 1
reads 1
the 1
paper 1
or 1
studies 1
train 1
timetables 1
His 1
idea 1
of 1
relaxation 1
is 1
working 1
with 1
his 1
fretsaw 1
He 1
s 1
made 1
a 1
little 1
frame 1
for 1
instance 1
it 1
only 1
took 1
him 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
evenings 1
you 1
ll 1
be 1
amazed 1
how 1
nice 1
it 1
is 1
it 1
s 1
hanging 1
up 1
in 1
his 1
room 1
you 1
ll 1
see 1
it 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
Gregor 1
opens 1
the 1
door 1
Anyway 1
I 1
m 1
glad 1
you 1
re 1
here 1
we 1
wouldn 1
t 1
have 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
get 1
Gregor 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
by 1
ourselves 1
he 1
s 1
so 1
stubborn 1
and 1
I 1
m 1
sure 1
he 1
isn 1
t 1
well 1
he 1
said 1
this 1
morning 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
but 1
he 1
isn 1
t 1
I 1
ll 1
be 1
there 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
said 1
Gregor 1
slowly 1
and 1
thoughtfully 1
but 1
without 1
moving 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
miss 1
any 1
word 1
of 1
the 1
conversation 1
Well 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
think 1
of 1
any 1
other 1
way 1
of 1
explaining 1
it 1
Mrs 1
Samsa 1
said 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
I 1
hope 1
it 1
s 1
nothing 1
serious 1
But 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
I 1
must 1
say 1
that 1
if 1
we 1
people 1
in 1
commerce 1
ever 1
become 1
slightly 1
unwell 1
then 1
fortunately 1
or 1
unfortunately 1
as 1
you 1
like 1
we 1
simply 1
have 1
to 1
overcome 1
it 1
because 1
of 1
business 1
considerations 1
Can 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
come 1
in 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
now 1
then 1
asked 1
his 1
father 1
impatiently 1
knocking 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
again 1
No 1
said 1
Gregor 1
In 1
the 1
room 1
on 1
his 1
right 1
there 1
followed 1
a 1
painful 1
silence 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
on 1
his 1
left 1
his 1
sister 1
began 1
to 1
cry 1
So 1
why 1
did 1
his 1
sister 1
not 1
go 1
and 1
join 1
the 1
others 1
She 1
had 1
probably 1
only 1
just 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
had 1
not 1
even 1
begun 1
to 1
get 1
dressed 1
And 1
why 1
was 1
she 1
crying 1
Was 1
it 1
because 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
had 1
not 1
let 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
in 1
because 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
danger 1
of 1
losing 1
his 1
job 1
and 1
if 1
that 1
happened 1
his 1
boss 1
would 1
once 1
more 1
pursue 1
their 1
parents 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
demands 1
as 1
before 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
need 1
to 1
worry 1
about 1
things 1
like 1
that 1
yet 1
Gregor 1
was 1
still 1
there 1
and 1
had 1
not 1
the 1
slightest 1
intention 1
of 1
abandoning 1
his 1
family 1
For 1
the 1
time 1
being 1
he 1
just 1
lay 1
there 1
on 1
the 1
carpet 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
who 1
knew 1
the 1
condition 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
would 1
seriously 1
have 1
expected 1
him 1
to 1
let 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
in 1
It 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
minor 1
discourtesy 1
and 1
a 1
suitable 1
excuse 1
could 1
easily 1
be 1
found 1
for 1
it 1
later 1
on 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
something 1
for 1
which 1
Gregor 1
could 1
be 1
sacked 1
on 1
the 1
spot 1
And 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
Gregor 1
much 1
more 1
sensible 1
to 1
leave 1
him 1
now 1
in 1
peace 1
instead 1
of 1
disturbing 1
him 1
with 1
talking 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
crying 1
But 1
the 1
others 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
was 1
happening 1
they 1
were 1
worried 1
that 1
would 1
excuse 1
their 1
behaviour 1
The 1
chief 1
clerk 1
now 1
raised 1
his 1
voice 1
Mr 1
Samsa 1
he 1
called 1
to 1
him 1
what 1
is 1
wrong 1
You 1
barricade 1
yourself 1
in 1
your 1
room 1
give 1
us 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
yes 1
or 1
no 1
for 1
an 1
answer 1
you 1
are 1
causing 1
serious 1
and 1
unnecessary 1
concern 1
to 1
your 1
parents 1
and 1
you 1
fail 1
and 1
I 1
mention 1
this 1
just 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
you 1
fail 1
to 1
carry 1
out 1
your 1
business 1
duties 1
in 1
a 1
way 1
that 1
is 1
quite 1
unheard 1
of 1
I 1
m 1
speaking 1
here 1
on 1
behalf 1
of 1
your 1
parents 1
and 1
of 1
your 1
employer 1
and 1
really 1
must 1
request 1
a 1
clear 1
and 1
immediate 1
explanation 1
I 1
am 1
astonished 1
quite 1
astonished 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
knew 1
you 1
as 1
a 1
calm 1
and 1
sensible 1
person 1
and 1
now 1
you 1
suddenly 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
showing 1
off 1
with 1
peculiar 1
whims 1
This 1
morning 1
your 1
employer 1
did 1
suggest 1
a 1
possible 1
reason 1
for 1
your 1
failure 1
to 1
appear 1
it 1
s 1
true 1
it 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
the 1
money 1
that 1
was 1
recently 1
entrusted 1
to 1
you 1
but 1
I 1
came 1
near 1
to 1
giving 1
him 1
my 1
word 1
of 1
honour 1
that 2
could 1
not 1
be 1
the 1
right 1
explanation 1
But 1
now 1
that 1
I 1
see 1
your 1
incomprehensible 1
stubbornness 1
I 1
no 1
longer 1
feel 1
any 1
wish 1
whatsoever 1
to 1
intercede 1
on 1
your 1
behalf 1
And 1
nor 1
is 1
your 1
position 1
all 1
that 1
secure 1
I 1
had 1
originally 1
intended 1
to 1
say 1
all 1
this 1
to 1
you 1
in 1
private 1
but 1
since 1
you 1
cause 1
me 1
to 1
waste 1
my 1
time 1
here 1
for 1
no 1
good 1
reason 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
see 1
why 1
your 1
parents 1
should 1
not 1
also 1
learn 1
of 1
it 1
Your 1
turnover 1
has 1
been 1
very 1
unsatisfactory 1
of 1
late 1
I 1
grant 1
you 1
that 1
it 1
s 1
not 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
year 1
to 1
do 1
especially 1
good 1
business 1
we 1
recognise 1
that 1
but 1
there 1
simply 1
is 1
no 1
time 1
of 1
year 1
to 1
do 1
no 1
business 1
at 1
all 1
Mr 1
Samsa 1
we 1
cannot 1
allow 1
there 1
to 1
be 1
But 1
Sir 1
called 1
Gregor 1
beside 1
himself 1
and 1
forgetting 1
all 1
else 1
in 1
the 1
excitement 1
I 1
ll 1
open 1
up 1
immediately 1
just 1
a 1
moment 1
I 1
m 1
slightly 1
unwell 1
an 1
attack 1
of 1
dizziness 1
I 1
haven 1
t 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
I 1
m 1
still 1
in 1
bed 1
now 1
I 1
m 1
quite 1
fresh 1
again 1
now 1
though 1
I 1
m 1
just 1
getting 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
Just 1
a 1
moment 1
Be 1
patient 1
It 1
s 1
not 1
quite 1
as 1
easy 1
as 1
I 1
d 1
thought 1
I 1
m 1
quite 1
alright 1
now 1
though 1
It 1
s 1
shocking 1
what 1
can 1
suddenly 1
happen 1
to 1
a 1
person 1
I 1
was 1
quite 1
alright 1
last 1
night 1
my 1
parents 1
know 1
about 1
it 1
perhaps 1
better 1
than 1
me 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
small 1
symptom 1
of 1
it 1
last 1
night 1
already 1
They 1
must 1
have 1
noticed 1
it 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
why 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
let 1
you 1
know 1
at 1
work 1
But 1
you 1
always 1
think 1
you 1
can 1
get 1
over 1
an 1
illness 1
without 1
staying 1
at 1
home 1
Please 1
don 1
t 1
make 1
my 1
parents 1
suffer 1
There 1
s 1
no 1
basis 1
for 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
accusations 1
you 1
re 1
making 1
nobody 1
s 1
ever 1
said 1
a 1
word 1
to 1
me 1
about 1
any 1
of 1
these 1
things 1
Maybe 1
you 1
haven 1
t 1
read 1
the 1
latest 1
contracts 1
I 1
sent 1
in 1
I 1
ll 1
set 1
off 1
with 1
the 1
eight 1
o 1
clock 1
train 1
as 1
well 1
these 1
few 1
hours 1
of 1
rest 1
have 1
given 1
me 1
strength 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
need 1
to 1
wait 1
sir 1
I 1
ll 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
office 1
soon 1
after 1
you 1
and 1
please 1
be 1
so 1
good 1
as 1
to 1
tell 1
that 1
to 1
the 1
boss 1
and 1
recommend 1
me 1
to 1
him 1
And 1
while 1
Gregor 1
gushed 1
out 1
these 1
words 1
hardly 1
knowing 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
saying 1
he 1
made 1
his 1
way 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
this 1
was 1
easily 1
done 1
probably 1
because 1
of 1
the 1
practise 1
he 1
had 1
already 1
had 1
in 1
bed 1
where 1
he 1
now 1
tried 1
to 1
get 1
himself 1
upright 1
He 1
really 1
did 1
want 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
really 1
did 1
want 1
to 1
let 1
them 1
see 1
him 1
and 1
to 1
speak 1
with 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
the 1
others 1
were 1
being 1
so 1
insistent 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
curious 1
to 1
learn 1
what 1
they 1
would 1
say 1
when 1
they 1
caught 1
sight 1
of 1
him 1
If 1
they 1
were 1
shocked 1
then 1
it 1
would 1
no 1
longer 1
be 1
Gregor 1
s 1
responsibility 1
and 1
he 1
could 1
rest 1
If 1
however 1
they 1
took 1
everything 1
calmly 1
he 1
would 1
still 1
have 1
no 1
reason 1
to 1
be 1
upset 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
hurried 1
he 1
really 1
could 1
be 1
at 1
the 1
station 1
for 1
eight 1
o 1
clock 1
The 1
first 1
few 1
times 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
climb 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
smooth 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
he 1
just 1
slid 1
down 1
again 1
but 1
he 1
finally 1
gave 1
himself 1
one 1
last 1
swing 1
and 1
stood 1
there 1
upright 1
the 1
lower 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
was 1
in 1
serious 1
pain 1
but 1
he 1
no 1
longer 1
gave 1
any 1
attention 1
to 1
it 1
Now 1
he 1
let 1
himself 1
fall 1
against 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
a 1
nearby 1
chair 1
and 1
held 1
tightly 1
to 1
the 1
edges 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
his 1
little 1
legs 1
By 1
now 1
he 1
had 1
also 1
calmed 1
down 1
and 1
kept 1
quiet 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
listen 1
to 1
what 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
was 1
saying 1
Did 1
you 1
understand 1
a 1
word 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
asked 1
his 1
parents 1
surely 1
he 1
s 1
not 1
trying 1
to 1
make 1
fools 1
of 1
us 1
Oh 1
God 1
called 1
his 1
mother 1
who 1
was 1
already 1
in 1
tears 1
he 1
could 1
be 1
seriously 1
ill 1
and 1
we 1
re 1
making 1
him 1
suffer 1
Grete 2
she 1
then 1
cried 1
Mother 1
his 1
sister 1
called 1
from 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
They 1
communicated 1
across 1
Gregor 1
s 1
room 1
You 1
ll 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
for 1
the 1
doctor 1
straight 1
away 1
Gregor 1
is 1
ill 1
Quick 1
get 1
the 1
doctor 1
Did 1
you 1
hear 1
the 1
way 1
Gregor 1
spoke 1
just 1
now 1
That 1
was 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
an 1
animal 1
said 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
with 1
a 1
calmness 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
contrast 1
with 1
his 1
mother 1
s 1
screams 1
Anna 2
his 1
father 1
called 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
through 1
the 1
entrance 1
hall 1
clapping 1
his 1
hands 1
get 1
a 1
locksmith 1
here 1
now 1
And 1
the 1
two 1
girls 1
their 1
skirts 1
swishing 1
immediately 1
ran 1
out 1
through 1
the 1
hall 1
wrenching 1
open 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
flat 1
as 1
they 1
went 1
How 1
had 1
his 1
sister 1
managed 1
to 1
get 1
dressed 1
so 1
quickly 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
banging 1
shut 1
again 1
they 1
must 1
have 1
left 1
it 1
open 1
people 1
often 1
do 1
in 1
homes 1
where 1
something 1
awful 1
has 1
happened 1
Gregor 1
in 1
contrast 1
had 1
become 1
much 1
calmer 1
So 1
they 1
couldn 1
t 1
understand 1
his 1
words 1
any 1
more 1
although 1
they 1
seemed 1
clear 1
enough 1
to 1
him 1
clearer 1
than 1
before 1
perhaps 1
his 1
ears 1
had 1
become 1
used 1
to 1
the 1
sound 1
They 1
had 1
realised 1
though 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
wrong 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
were 1
ready 1
to 1
help 1
The 1
first 1
response 1
to 1
his 1
situation 1
had 1
been 1
confident 1
and 1
wise 1
and 1
that 1
made 1
him 1
feel 1
better 1
He 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
drawn 1
back 1
in 1
among 1
people 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
doctor 1
and 1
the 1
locksmith 1
he 1
expected 1
great 1
and 1
surprising 1
achievements 1
although 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
really 1
distinguish 1
one 1
from 1
the 1
other 1
Whatever 1
was 1
said 1
next 1
would 1
be 1
crucial 1
so 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
make 1
his 1
voice 1
as 1
clear 1
as 1
possible 1
he 1
coughed 1
a 1
little 1
but 1
taking 1
care 1
to 1
do 1
this 1
not 1
too 1
loudly 1
as 1
even 1
this 1
might 1
well 1
sound 1
different 1
from 1
the 1
way 1
that 1
a 1
human 1
coughs 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
no 1
longer 1
sure 1
he 1
could 1
judge 1
this 1
for 1
himself 1
Meanwhile 1
it 1
had 1
become 1
very 1
quiet 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
Perhaps 1
his 1
parents 1
were 1
sat 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
whispering 1
with 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
or 1
perhaps 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
pressed 1
against 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
listening 1
Gregor 1
slowly 1
pushed 1
his 1
way 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
the 1
chair 1
Once 1
there 1
he 1
let 1
go 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
threw 1
himself 1
onto 1
the 1
door 1
holding 1
himself 1
upright 1
against 1
it 1
using 1
the 1
adhesive 1
on 1
the 1
tips 1
of 1
his 1
legs 1
He 1
rested 1
there 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
to 1
recover 1
from 1
the 1
effort 1
involved 1
and 1
then 1
set 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
task 1
of 1
turning 1
the 1
key 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
with 1
his 1
mouth 1
He 1
seemed 1
unfortunately 1
to 1
have 1
no 1
proper 1
teeth 1
how 1
was 1
he 1
then 1
to 1
grasp 1
the 1
key 1
but 1
the 1
lack 1
of 1
teeth 1
was 1
of 1
course 1
made 1
up 1
for 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
strong 1
jaw 1
using 1
the 1
jaw 1
he 1
really 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
start 1
the 1
key 1
turning 1
ignoring 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
causing 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
damage 1
as 1
a 1
brown 1
fluid 1
came 1
from 1
his 1
mouth 1
flowed 1
over 1
the 1
key 1
and 1
dripped 1
onto 1
the 1
floor 1
Listen 1
said 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
he 1
s 1
turning 1
the 1
key 1
Gregor 1
was 1
greatly 1
encouraged 1
by 1
this 1
but 1
they 1
all 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
calling 1
to 1
him 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
his 1
mother 1
too 1
Well 1
done 1
Gregor 1
they 1
should 1
have 1
cried 1
keep 1
at 1
it 1
keep 1
hold 1
of 1
the 1
lock 1
And 1
with 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
excitedly 1
following 1
his 1
efforts 1
he 1
bit 1
on 1
the 1
key 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
strength 1
paying 1
no 1
attention 1
to 1
the 1
pain 1
he 1
was 1
causing 1
himself 1
As 1
the 1
key 1
turned 1
round 1
he 1
turned 1
around 1
the 1
lock 1
with 1
it 1
only 1
holding 1
himself 1
upright 1
with 1
his 1
mouth 1
and 1
hung 1
onto 1
the 1
key 1
or 1
pushed 1
it 1
down 1
again 1
with 1
the 1
whole 1
weight 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
as 1
needed 1
The 1
clear 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
lock 1
as 1
it 1
snapped 1
back 1
was 1
Gregor 1
s 1
sign 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
break 1
his 1
concentration 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
regained 1
his 1
breath 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
So 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
need 1
the 1
locksmith 1
after 1
all 1
Then 1
he 1
lay 1
his 1
head 1
on 1
the 1
handle 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
open 1
it 1
completely 1
Because 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
it 1
was 1
already 1
wide 1
open 1
before 1
he 1
could 1
be 1
seen 1
He 1
had 1
first 1
to 1
slowly 1
turn 1
himself 1
around 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
double 1
doors 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
very 1
carefully 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
fall 1
flat 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
before 1
entering 1
the 1
room 1
He 1
was 1
still 1
occupied 1
with 1
this 1
difficult 1
movement 1
unable 1
to 1
pay 1
attention 1
to 1
anything 1
else 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
exclaim 1
a 1
loud 1
Oh 1
which 1
sounded 1
like 1
the 1
soughing 1
of 1
the 1
wind 1
Now 1
he 1
also 1
saw 1
him 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
nearest 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
his 1
hand 1
pressed 1
against 1
his 1
open 1
mouth 1
and 1
slowly 1
retreating 1
as 1
if 1
driven 1
by 1
a 1
steady 1
and 1
invisible 1
force 1
Gregor 1
s 1
mother 1
her 1
hair 1
still 1
dishevelled 1
from 1
bed 1
despite 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
s 1
being 1
there 1
looked 1
at 1
his 1
father 1
Then 1
she 1
unfolded 1
her 1
arms 1
took 1
two 1
steps 1
forward 1
towards 1
Gregor 1
and 1
sank 1
down 1
onto 1
the 1
floor 1
into 1
her 1
skirts 1
that 1
spread 1
themselves 1
out 1
around 1
her 1
as 1
her 1
head 1
disappeared 1
down 1
onto 1
her 1
breast 1
His 1
father 1
looked 1
hostile 1
and 1
clenched 1
his 1
fists 1
as 1
if 1
wanting 1
to 1
knock 1
Gregor 1
back 1
into 1
his 1
room 1
Then 1
he 1
looked 1
uncertainly 1
round 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
covered 1
his 1
eyes 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
wept 1
so 1
that 1
his 1
powerful 1
chest 1
shook 1
So 1
Gregor 1
did 1
not 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
but 1
leant 1
against 1
the 1
inside 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
door 1
which 1
was 1
still 1
held 1
bolted 1
in 1
place 1
In 1
this 1
way 1
only 1
half 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
could 1
be 1
seen 1
along 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
above 1
it 1
which 1
he 1
leant 1
over 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
as 1
he 1
peered 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
others 1
Meanwhile 1
the 1
day 1
had 1
become 1
much 1
lighter 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
endless 1
grey 1
black 1
building 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
hospital 1
could 1
be 1
seen 1
quite 1
clearly 1
with 1
the 1
austere 1
and 1
regular 1
line 1
of 1
windows 1
piercing 1
its 1
facade 1
the 1
rain 1
was 1
still 1
falling 1
now 1
throwing 1
down 1
large 1
individual 1
droplets 1
which 1
hit 1
the 1
ground 1
one 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
The 1
washing 1
up 1
from 1
breakfast 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
there 1
was 1
so 1
much 1
of 1
it 1
because 1
for 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
breakfast 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
important 1
meal 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
stretch 1
it 1
out 1
for 1
several 1
hours 1
as 1
he 1
sat 1
reading 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
different 1
newspapers 1
On 1
the 1
wall 1
exactly 1
opposite 1
there 1
was 1
photograph 1
of 1
Gregor 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
lieutenant 1
in 1
the 1
army 1
his 1
sword 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
a 1
carefree 1
smile 1
on 1
his 1
face 1
as 1
he 1
called 1
forth 1
respect 1
for 1
his 1
uniform 1
and 1
bearing 1
The 1
door 1
to 1
the 1
entrance 1
hall 1
was 1
open 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
flat 1
was 1
also 1
open 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
onto 1
the 1
landing 1
and 1
the 1
stairs 1
where 1
they 1
began 1
their 1
way 1
down 1
below 1
Now 1
then 1
said 1
Gregor 1
well 1
aware 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
to 1
have 1
kept 1
calm 1
I 1
ll 1
get 1
dressed 1
straight 1
away 1
now 1
pack 1
up 1
my 1
samples 1
and 1
set 1
off 1
Will 1
you 1
please 1
just 1
let 1
me 1
leave 1
You 1
can 1
see 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
that 1
I 1
m 1
not 1
stubborn 1
and 1
I 1
like 1
to 1
do 1
my 1
job 1
being 1
a 1
commercial 1
traveller 1
is 1
arduous 1
but 1
without 1
travelling 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
earn 1
my 1
living 1
So 1
where 1
are 1
you 1
going 1
in 1
to 1
the 1
office 1
Yes 1
Will 1
you 1
report 1
everything 1
accurately 1
then 1
It 1
s 1
quite 1
possible 1
for 1
someone 1
to 1
be 1
temporarily 1
unable 1
to 1
work 1
but 1
that 1
s 1
just 1
the 1
right 1
time 1
to 1
remember 1
what 1
s 1
been 1
achieved 1
in 1
the 1
past 1
and 1
consider 1
that 1
later 1
on 1
once 1
the 1
difficulty 1
has 1
been 1
removed 1
he 1
will 1
certainly 1
work 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
more 1
diligence 1
and 1
concentration 1
You 1
re 1
well 1
aware 1
that 1
I 1
m 1
seriously 1
in 1
debt 1
to 1
our 1
employer 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
having 1
to 1
look 1
after 1
my 1
parents 1
and 1
my 1
sister 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
m 1
trapped 1
in 1
a 1
difficult 1
situation 1
but 1
I 1
will 1
work 1
my 1
way 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
again 1
Please 1
don 1
t 1
make 1
things 1
any 1
harder 1
for 1
me 1
than 1
they 1
are 1
already 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
take 1
sides 1
against 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
office 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
nobody 1
likes 1
the 1
travellers 1
They 1
think 1
we 1
earn 1
an 1
enormous 1
wage 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
having 1
a 1
soft 1
time 1
of 1
it 1
That 1
s 1
just 1
prejudice 1
but 1
they 1
have 1
no 1
particular 1
reason 1
to 1
think 1
better 1
of 1
it 1
But 1
you 1
sir 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
better 1
overview 1
than 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
staff 1
in 1
fact 1
if 1
I 1
can 1
say 1
this 1
in 1
confidence 1
a 1
better 1
overview 1
than 1
the 1
boss 1
himself 1
it 1
s 1
very 1
easy 1
for 1
a 1
businessman 1
like 1
him 1
to 1
make 1
mistakes 1
about 1
his 1
employees 1
and 1
judge 1
them 1
more 1
harshly 1
than 1
he 1
should 1
And 1
you 1
re 1
also 1
well 1
aware 1
that 1
we 1
travellers 1
spend 1
almost 1
the 1
whole 1
year 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
office 1
so 1
that 1
we 1
can 1
very 1
easily 1
fall 1
victim 1
to 1
gossip 1
and 1
chance 1
and 1
groundless 1
complaints 1
and 1
it 1
s 1
almost 1
impossible 1
to 1
defend 1
yourself 1
from 1
that 1
sort 1
of 1
thing 1
we 1
don 1
t 1
usually 1
even 1
hear 1
about 1
them 1
or 1
if 1
at 1
all 1
it 1
s 1
when 1
we 1
arrive 1
back 1
home 1
exhausted 1
from 1
a 1
trip 1
and 1
that 1
s 1
when 1
we 1
feel 1
the 1
harmful 1
effects 1
of 1
what 1
s 1
been 1
going 1
on 1
without 1
even 1
knowing 1
what 1
caused 1
them 1
Please 1
don 1
t 1
go 1
away 1
at 1
least 1
first 1
say 1
something 1
to 1
show 1
that 1
you 1
grant 1
that 1
I 1
m 1
at 1
least 1
partly 1
right 1
But 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
had 1
turned 1
away 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
Gregor 1
had 1
started 1
to 1
speak 1
and 1
with 1
protruding 1
lips 1
only 1
stared 1
back 1
at 1
him 1
over 1
his 1
trembling 1
shoulders 1
as 1
he 1
left 1
He 1
did 1
not 1
keep 1
still 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
while 1
Gregor 1
was 1
speaking 1
but 1
moved 1
steadily 1
towards 1
the 1
door 1
without 1
taking 1
his 1
eyes 1
off 1
him 1
He 1
moved 1
very 1
gradually 1
as 1
if 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
some 1
secret 1
prohibition 1
on 1
leaving 1
the 1
room 1
It 1
was 1
only 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
entrance 1
hall 1
that 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
sudden 1
movement 1
drew 1
his 1
foot 1
from 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
and 1
rushed 1
forward 1
in 1
a 1
panic 1
In 1
the 1
hall 1
he 1
stretched 1
his 1
right 1
hand 1
far 1
out 1
towards 1
the 1
stairway 1
as 1
if 1
out 1
there 2
were 1
some 1
supernatural 1
force 1
waiting 1
to 1
save 1
him 1
Gregor 1
realised 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
question 1
to 1
let 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
go 1
away 1
in 1
this 1
mood 1
if 1
his 1
position 1
in 1
the 1
firm 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
put 1
into 1
extreme 1
danger 1
That 1
was 1
something 1
his 1
parents 1
did 1
not 1
understand 1
very 1
well 1
over 1
the 1
years 1
they 1
had 1
become 1
convinced 1
that 1
this 1
job 1
would 1
provide 1
for 1
Gregor 1
for 1
his 1
entire 1
life 1
and 1
besides 1
they 1
had 1
so 1
much 1
to 1
worry 1
about 1
at 1
present 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
lost 1
sight 1
of 1
any 1
thought 1
for 1
the 1
future 1
Gregor 1
though 1
did 1
think 1
about 1
the 1
future 1
The 1
chief 1
clerk 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
held 1
back 1
calmed 1
down 1
convinced 1
and 1
finally 1
won 1
over 1
the 1
future 1
of 1
Gregor 1
and 1
his 1
family 1
depended 1
on 1
it 1
If 1
only 1
his 1
sister 1
were 1
here 1
She 1
was 1
clever 1
she 1
was 1
already 1
in 1
tears 1
while 1
Gregor 1
was 1
still 1
lying 1
peacefully 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
And 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
was 1
a 1
lover 1
of 1
women 1
surely 1
she 1
could 1
persuade 1
him 1
she 1
would 1
close 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
in 1
the 1
entrance 1
hall 1
and 1
talk 1
him 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
shocked 1
state 1
But 1
his 1
sister 1
was 1
not 1
there 1
Gregor 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
job 1
himself 1
And 1
without 1
considering 1
that 1
he 1
still 1
was 1
not 1
familiar 1
with 1
how 1
well 1
he 1
could 1
move 1
about 1
in 1
his 1
present 1
state 1
or 1
that 1
his 1
speech 1
still 1
might 1
not 1
or 1
probably 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
understood 1
he 1
let 1
go 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
pushed 1
himself 1
through 1
the 1
opening 1
tried 1
to 1
reach 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
on 1
the 1
landing 1
who 1
ridiculously 1
was 1
holding 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
banister 1
with 1
both 1
hands 1
but 1
Gregor 1
fell 1
immediately 1
over 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
scream 1
as 1
he 1
sought 1
something 1
to 1
hold 1
onto 1
landed 1
on 1
his 1
numerous 1
little 1
legs 1
Hardly 1
had 1
that 1
happened 1
than 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
that 1
day 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
alright 1
with 1
his 1
body 1
the 1
little 1
legs 1
had 1
the 1
solid 1
ground 1
under 1
them 1
to 1
his 1
pleasure 1
they 1
did 1
exactly 1
as 1
he 1
told 1
them 1
they 1
were 1
even 1
making 1
the 1
effort 1
to 1
carry 1
him 1
where 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
soon 1
believing 1
that 1
all 1
his 1
sorrows 1
would 1
soon 1
be 1
finally 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
He 1
held 1
back 1
the 1
urge 1
to 1
move 1
but 1
swayed 1
from 1
side 1
to 1
side 1
as 1
he 1
crouched 1
there 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
His 1
mother 1
was 1
not 1
far 1
away 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
seemed 1
at 1
first 1
quite 1
engrossed 1
in 1
herself 1
but 1
then 1
she 1
suddenly 1
jumped 1
up 1
with 1
her 1
arms 1
outstretched 1
and 1
her 1
fingers 1
spread 1
shouting 1
Help 1
for 1
pity 1
s 1
sake 1
Help 1
The 1
way 1
she 1
held 1
her 1
head 1
suggested 1
she 1
wanted 1
to 1
see 1
Gregor 1
better 1
but 1
the 1
unthinking 1
way 1
she 1
was 1
hurrying 1
backwards 1
showed 1
that 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
she 1
had 1
forgotten 1
that 1
the 1
table 1
was 1
behind 1
her 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
breakfast 1
things 1
on 1
it 1
when 1
she 1
reached 1
the 1
table 1
she 1
sat 1
quickly 1
down 1
on 1
it 1
without 1
knowing 1
what 1
she 1
was 1
doing 1
without 1
even 1
seeming 1
to 1
notice 1
that 1
the 1
coffee 1
pot 1
had 1
been 1
knocked 1
over 1
and 1
a 1
gush 1
of 1
coffee 1
was 1
pouring 1
down 1
onto 1
the 1
carpet 1
Mother 1
mother 1
said 1
Gregor 1
gently 1
looking 1
up 1
at 1
her 1
He 1
had 1
completely 1
forgotten 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
but 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
himself 1
snapping 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
with 1
his 1
jaws 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
flow 1
of 1
coffee 1
That 1
set 1
his 1
mother 1
screaming 1
anew 1
she 1
fled 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
into 1
the 1
arms 1
of 1
his 1
father 1
as 1
he 1
rushed 1
towards 1
her 1
Gregor 1
though 1
had 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
spare 1
for 1
his 1
parents 1
now 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
had 1
already 1
reached 1
the 1
stairs 1
with 1
his 1
chin 1
on 1
the 1
banister 1
he 1
looked 1
back 1
for 1
the 1
last 1
time 1
Gregor 1
made 1
a 1
run 1
for 1
him 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
be 1
sure 1
of 1
reaching 1
him 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
must 1
have 1
expected 1
something 1
as 1
he 1
leapt 1
down 1
several 1
steps 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
disappeared 1
his 1
shouts 1
resounding 1
all 1
around 1
the 1
staircase 1
The 1
flight 1
of 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
seemed 1
unfortunately 1
to 1
put 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
into 1
a 1
panic 1
as 1
well 1
Until 1
then 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
relatively 1
self 1
controlled 1
but 1
now 1
instead 1
of 1
running 1
after 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
himself 1
or 1
at 1
least 1
not 1
impeding 1
Gregor 1
as 1
he 1
ran 1
after 1
him 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
seized 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
s 1
stick 1
in 1
his 1
right 1
hand 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
had 1
left 1
it 1
behind 1
on 1
a 1
chair 1
along 1
with 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
overcoat 1
picked 1
up 1
a 1
large 1
newspaper 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
with 1
his 1
left 1
and 1
used 1
them 1
to 1
drive 1
Gregor 1
back 1
into 1
his 1
room 1
stamping 1
his 1
foot 1
at 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
Gregor 1
s 1
appeals 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
were 1
of 1
no 1
help 1
his 1
appeals 1
were 1
simply 1
not 1
understood 1
however 1
much 1
he 1
humbly 1
turned 1
his 1
head 1
his 1
father 1
merely 1
stamped 1
his 1
foot 1
all 1
the 1
harder 1
Across 1
the 1
room 1
despite 1
the 1
chilly 1
weather 1
Gregor 1
s 1
mother 1
had 1
pulled 1
open 1
a 1
window 1
leant 1
far 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
pressed 1
her 1
hands 1
to 1
her 1
face 1
A 1
strong 1
draught 1
of 1
air 1
flew 1
in 1
from 1
the 1
street 1
towards 1
the 1
stairway 1
the 1
curtains 1
flew 1
up 1
the 1
newspapers 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
fluttered 1
and 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
were 1
blown 1
onto 1
the 1
floor 1
Nothing 1
would 1
stop 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
as 1
he 1
drove 1
him 1
back 1
making 1
hissing 1
noises 1
at 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
wild 1
man 1
Gregor 1
had 1
never 1
had 1
any 1
practice 1
in 1
moving 1
backwards 1
and 1
was 1
only 1
able 1
to 1
go 1
very 1
slowly 1
If 1
Gregor 1
had 1
only 1
been 1
allowed 1
to 1
turn 1
round 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
room 1
straight 1
away 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
afraid 1
that 1
if 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
time 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
his 1
father 1
would 1
become 1
impatient 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
threat 1
of 1
a 1
lethal 1
blow 1
to 1
his 1
back 1
or 1
head 1
from 1
the 1
stick 1
in 1
his 1
father 1
s 1
hand 1
any 1
moment 1
Eventually 1
though 1
Gregor 1
realised 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
choice 1
as 1
he 1
saw 1
to 1
his 1
disgust 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
quite 1
incapable 1
of 1
going 1
backwards 1
in 1
a 1
straight 1
line 1
so 1
he 1
began 1
as 1
quickly 1
as 1
possible 1
and 1
with 1
frequent 1
anxious 1
glances 1
at 1
his 1
father 1
to 1
turn 1
himself 1
round 1
It 1
went 1
very 1
slowly 1
but 1
perhaps 1
his 1
father 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
see 1
his 1
good 1
intentions 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
nothing 1
to 1
hinder 1
him 1
in 1
fact 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
used 1
the 1
tip 1
of 1
his 1
stick 1
to 1
give 1
directions 1
from 1
a 1
distance 1
as 1
to 1
which 1
way 1
to 1
turn 1
If 1
only 1
his 1
father 1
would 1
stop 1
that 1
unbearable 1
hissing 1
It 1
was 1
making 1
Gregor 1
quite 1
confused 1
When 1
he 1
had 1
nearly 1
finished 1
turning 1
round 1
still 1
listening 1
to 1
that 1
hissing 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
mistake 1
and 1
turned 1
himself 1
back 1
a 1
little 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
had 1
just 1
come 1
He 1
was 1
pleased 1
when 1
he 1
finally 1
had 1
his 1
head 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
doorway 1
but 1
then 1
saw 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
narrow 1
and 1
his 1
body 1
was 1
too 1
broad 1
to 1
get 1
through 1
it 1
without 1
further 1
difficulty 1
In 1
his 1
present 1
mood 1
it 1
obviously 1
did 1
not 1
occur 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
other 1
of 1
the 1
double 1
doors 1
so 1
that 1
Gregor 1
would 1
have 1
enough 1
space 1
to 1
get 1
through 1
He 1
was 1
merely 1
fixed 1
on 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
Gregor 1
should 1
be 1
got 1
back 1
into 1
his 1
room 1
as 1
quickly 1
as 1
possible 1
Nor 1
would 1
he 1
ever 1
have 1
allowed 1
Gregor 1
the 1
time 1
to 1
get 1
himself 1
upright 1
as 1
preparation 1
for 1
getting 1
through 1
the 1
doorway 1
What 1
he 1
did 1
making 1
more 1
noise 1
than 1
ever 1
was 1
to 1
drive 1
Gregor 1
forwards 1
all 1
the 1
harder 1
as 1
if 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
it 1
sounded 1
to 1
Gregor 1
as 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
now 1
more 1
than 1
one 1
father 1
behind 1
him 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
pleasant 1
experience 1
and 1
Gregor 1
pushed 1
himself 1
into 1
the 1
doorway 1
without 1
regard 1
for 1
what 1
might 1
happen 1
One 1
side 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
lifted 1
itself 1
he 1
lay 1
at 1
an 1
angle 1
in 1
the 1
doorway 1
one 1
flank 1
scraped 1
on 1
the 1
white 1
door 1
and 1
was 1
painfully 1
injured 1
leaving 1
vile 1
brown 1
flecks 1
on 1
it 1
soon 1
he 1
was 1
stuck 1
fast 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
move 1
at 1
all 1
by 1
himself 1
the 1
little 1
legs 1
along 1
one 1
side 1
hung 1
quivering 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
while 1
those 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
were 1
pressed 1
painfully 1
against 1
the 1
ground 1
Then 1
his 1
father 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
hefty 1
shove 1
from 1
behind 1
which 1
released 1
him 1
from 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
held 1
and 1
sent 1
him 1
flying 1
and 1
heavily 1
bleeding 1
deep 1
into 1
his 1
room 1
The 1
door 1
was 1
slammed 1
shut 1
with 1
the 1
stick 1
then 1
finally 1
all 1
was 1
quiet 1
II 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
until 1
it 1
was 1
getting 1
dark 1
that 1
evening 1
that 1
Gregor 1
awoke 1
from 1
his 1
deep 1
and 1
coma 1
like 1
sleep 1
He 1
would 1
have 1
woken 1
soon 1
afterwards 1
anyway 1
even 1
if 1
he 1
hadn 1
t 1
been 1
disturbed 1
as 1
he 1
had 2
enough 1
sleep 1
and 1
felt 1
fully 1
rested 1
But 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
impression 1
that 1
some 1
hurried 1
steps 1
and 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
leading 1
into 1
the 1
front 1
room 1
being 1
carefully 1
shut 1
had 1
woken 1
him 1
The 1
light 1
from 1
the 1
electric 1
street 1
lamps 1
shone 1
palely 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
onto 1
the 1
ceiling 1
and 1
tops 1
of 1
the 1
furniture 1
but 1
down 1
below 1
where 1
Gregor 1
was 1
it 1
was 1
dark 1
He 1
pushed 1
himself 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
feeling 1
his 1
way 1
clumsily 1
with 1
his 1
antennae 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
now 1
beginning 1
to 1
learn 1
the 1
value 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
had 1
been 1
happening 1
there 1
The 1
whole 1
of 1
his 1
left 1
side 1
seemed 1
like 1
one 1
painfully 1
stretched 1
scar 1
and 1
he 1
limped 1
badly 1
on 1
his 1
two 1
rows 1
of 1
legs 1
One 1
of 1
the 1
legs 1
had 1
been 1
badly 1
injured 1
in 1
the 1
events 1
of 1
that 1
morning 1
it 1
was 1
nearly 1
a 1
miracle 1
that 1
only 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
had 1
been 1
and 1
dragged 1
along 1
lifelessly 1
It 1
was 1
only 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
door 1
that 1
he 1
realised 1
what 1
it 1
actually 1
was 1
that 1
had 1
drawn 1
him 1
over 1
to 1
it 2
was 1
the 1
smell 1
of 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
By 1
the 1
door 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
dish 1
filled 1
with 1
sweetened 1
milk 1
with 1
little 1
pieces 1
of 1
white 1
bread 1
floating 1
in 1
it 1
He 1
was 1
so 1
pleased 1
he 1
almost 1
laughed 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
even 1
hungrier 1
than 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
that 1
morning 1
and 1
immediately 1
dipped 1
his 1
head 1
into 1
the 1
milk 1
nearly 1
covering 1
his 1
eyes 1
with 1
it 1
But 1
he 1
soon 1
drew 1
his 1
head 1
back 1
again 1
in 1
disappointment 1
not 1
only 1
did 1
the 1
pain 1
in 1
his 1
tender 1
left 1
side 1
make 1
it 1
difficult 1
to 1
eat 1
the 1
food 1
he 1
was 1
only 1
able 1
to 1
eat 1
if 1
his 1
whole 1
body 1
worked 1
together 1
as 1
a 1
snuffling 1
whole 1
but 1
the 1
milk 1
did 1
not 1
taste 1
at 1
all 1
nice 1
Milk 1
like 1
this 1
was 1
normally 1
his 1
favourite 1
drink 1
and 1
his 1
sister 1
had 1
certainly 1
left 1
it 1
there 1
for 1
him 1
because 1
of 1
that 1
but 1
he 1
turned 1
almost 1
against 1
his 1
own 1
will 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
dish 1
and 1
crawled 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
Through 1
the 1
crack 1
in 1
the 1
door 1
Gregor 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
gas 1
had 1
been 1
lit 1
in 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
His 1
father 1
at 1
this 1
time 1
would 1
normally 1
be 1
sat 1
with 1
his 1
evening 1
paper 1
reading 1
it 1
out 1
in 1
a 1
loud 1
voice 1
to 1
Gregor 1
s 1
mother 1
and 1
sometimes 1
to 1
his 1
sister 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
now 1
not 1
a 1
sound 1
to 1
be 1
heard 1
Gregor 1
s 1
sister 1
would 1
often 1
write 1
and 1
tell 1
him 1
about 1
this 1
reading 1
but 1
maybe 1
his 1
father 1
had 1
lost 1
the 1
habit 1
in 1
recent 1
times 1
It 1
was 1
so 1
quiet 1
all 1
around 1
too 1
even 1
though 1
there 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
somebody 1
in 1
the 1
flat 1
What 1
a 1
quiet 1
life 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
family 1
lead 1
said 1
Gregor 1
to 1
himself 1
and 1
gazing 1
into 1
the 1
darkness 1
felt 1
a 1
great 1
pride 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
provide 1
a 1
life 1
like 1
that 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
nice 1
home 1
for 1
his 1
sister 1
and 1
parents 1
But 1
what 1
now 1
if 1
all 1
this 1
peace 1
and 1
wealth 1
and 1
comfort 1
should 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
horrible 1
and 1
frightening 1
end 1
That 1
was 1
something 1
that 1
Gregor 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
think 1
about 1
too 1
much 1
so 1
he 1
started 1
to 1
move 1
about 1
crawling 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
Once 1
during 1
that 1
long 1
evening 1
the 1
door 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
was 1
opened 1
very 1
slightly 1
and 1
hurriedly 1
closed 1
again 1
later 1
on 1
the 1
door 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
did 1
the 1
same 1
it 1
seemed 1
that 1
someone 1
needed 1
to 1
enter 1
the 1
room 1
but 1
thought 1
better 1
of 1
it 1
Gregor 1
went 1
and 1
waited 1
immediately 1
by 1
the 1
door 1
resolved 1
either 1
to 1
bring 1
the 1
timorous 1
visitor 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
some 1
way 1
or 1
at 1
least 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
but 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
opened 1
no 1
more 1
that 1
night 1
and 1
Gregor 1
waited 1
in 1
vain 1
The 1
previous 1
morning 1
while 1
the 1
doors 1
were 1
locked 1
everyone 1
had 1
wanted 1
to 1
get 1
in 1
there 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
now 2
that 1
he 1
had 1
opened 1
up 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
doors 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
had 1
clearly 1
been 1
unlocked 1
some 1
time 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
no 1
one 1
came 1
and 1
the 1
keys 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
sides 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
until 1
late 1
at 1
night 1
that 1
the 1
gaslight 1
in 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
was 1
put 1
out 1
and 1
now 1
it 1
was 1
easy 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
his 1
parents 1
and 1
sister 1
had 1
stayed 1
awake 1
all 1
that 1
time 1
as 1
they 1
all 1
could 1
be 1
distinctly 1
heard 1
as 1
they 1
went 1
away 1
together 1
on 1
tip 1
toe 1
It 1
was 1
clear 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
would 1
come 1
into 1
Gregor 1
s 1
room 1
any 1
more 1
until 1
morning 1
that 1
gave 1
him 1
plenty 1
of 1
time 1
to 1
think 1
undisturbed 1
about 1
how 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
re 1
arrange 1
his 1
life 1
For 1
some 1
reason 1
the 1
tall 1
empty 1
room 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
remain 1
made 1
him 1
feel 1
uneasy 1
as 1
he 1
lay 1
there 1
flat 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
even 1
though 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
living 1
in 1
it 1
for 1
five 1
years 1
Hardly 1
aware 1
of 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
doing 1
other 1
than 1
a 1
slight 1
feeling 1
of 1
shame 1
he 1
hurried 1
under 1
the 1
couch 1
It 1
pressed 1
down 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
no 1
longer 1
able 1
to 1
lift 1
his 1
head 1
but 1
he 1
nonetheless 1
felt 1
immediately 1
at 1
ease 1
and 1
his 1
only 1
regret 1
was 1
that 1
his 1
body 1
was 1
too 1
broad 1
to 1
get 1
it 1
all 1
underneath 1
He 1
spent 1
the 1
whole 1
night 1
there 1
Some 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
he 1
passed 1
in 1
a 1
light 1
sleep 1
although 1
he 1
frequently 1
woke 1
from 1
it 1
in 1
alarm 1
because 1
of 1
his 1
hunger 1
and 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
was 1
spent 1
in 1
worries 1
and 1
vague 1
hopes 1
which 1
however 1
always 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
conclusion 1
for 1
the 1
time 1
being 1
he 1
must 1
remain 1
calm 1
he 1
must 1
show 1
patience 1
and 1
the 1
greatest 1
consideration 1
so 1
that 1
his 1
family 1
could 1
bear 1
the 1
unpleasantness 1
that 1
he 1
in 1
his 1
present 1
condition 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
impose 1
on 1
them 1
Gregor 1
soon 1
had 1
the 1
opportunity 1
to 1
test 1
the 1
strength 1
of 1
his 1
decisions 1
as 1
early 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
almost 1
before 1
the 1
night 1
had 1
ended 1
his 1
sister 1
nearly 1
fully 1
dressed 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
from 1
the 1
front 1
room 1
and 1
looked 1
anxiously 1
in 1
She 1
did 1
not 1
see 1
him 1
straight 1
away 1
but 1
when 1
she 1
did 1
notice 1
him 1
under 1
the 1
couch 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
somewhere 1
for 1
God 1
s 1
sake 1
he 1
couldn 1
t 1
have 1
flown 1
away 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
shocked 1
that 1
she 1
lost 1
control 1
of 1
herself 1
and 1
slammed 1
the 1
door 1
shut 1
again 1
from 1
outside 1
But 1
she 1
seemed 1
to 1
regret 1
her 1
behaviour 1
as 1
she 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
again 1
straight 1
away 1
and 1
came 1
in 1
on 1
tip 1
toe 1
as 1
if 1
entering 1
the 1
room 1
of 1
someone 1
seriously 1
ill 1
or 1
even 1
of 1
a 1
stranger 1
Gregor 1
had 1
pushed 1
his 1
head 1
forward 1
right 1
to 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
couch 1
and 1
watched 1
her 1
Would 1
she 1
notice 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
the 1
milk 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
realise 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
from 1
any 1
lack 1
of 1
hunger 1
and 1
bring 1
him 1
in 1
some 1
other 1
food 1
that 1
was 1
more 1
suitable 1
If 1
she 1
didn 1
t 1
do 1
it 1
herself 1
he 1
would 1
rather 1
go 1
hungry 1
than 1
draw 1
her 1
attention 1
to 1
it 1
although 1
he 1
did 1
feel 1
a 1
terrible 1
urge 1
to 1
rush 1
forward 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
couch 1
throw 1
himself 1
at 1
his 1
sister 1
s 1
feet 1
and 1
beg 1
her 1
for 1
something 1
good 1
to 1
eat 1
However 1
his 1
sister 1
noticed 1
the 1
full 1
dish 1
immediately 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
few 1
drops 1
of 1
milk 1
splashed 1
around 1
it 1
with 1
some 1
surprise 1
She 1
immediately 1
picked 1
it 1
up 1
using 1
a 1
rag 1
not 1
her 1
bare 1
hands 1
and 1
carried 1
it 1
out 1
Gregor 1
was 1
extremely 1
curious 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
she 1
would 1
bring 1
in 1
its 1
place 1
imagining 1
the 1
wildest 1
possibilities 1
but 1
he 1
never 1
could 1
have 1
guessed 1
what 1
his 1
sister 1
in 1
her 1
goodness 1
actually 1
did 1
bring 1
In 1
order 1
to 1
test 1
his 1
taste 1
she 1
brought 1
him 1
a 1
whole 1
selection 1
of 1
things 1
all 1
spread 1
out 1
on 1
an 1
old 1
newspaper 1
There 1
were 1
old 1
half 1
rotten 1
vegetables 1
bones 1
from 1
the 1
evening 1
meal 1
covered 1
in 1
white 1
sauce 1
that 1
had 1
gone 1
hard 1
a 1
few 1
raisins 1
and 1
almonds 1
some 1
cheese 1
that 1
Gregor 1
had 1
declared 1
inedible 1
two 1
days 1
before 1
a 1
dry 1
roll 1
and 1
some 1
bread 1
spread 1
with 1
butter 1
and 1
salt 1
As 1
well 1
as 1
all 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
poured 1
some 1
water 1
into 1
the 1
dish 1
which 1
had 1
probably 1
been 1
permanently 1
set 1
aside 1
for 1
Gregor 1
s 1
use 1
and 1
placed 1
it 1
beside 1
them 1
Then 1
out 1
of 1
consideration 1
for 1
Gregor 1
s 1
feelings 1
as 1
she 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
eat 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
her 1
she 1
hurried 1
out 1
again 1
and 1
even 1
turned 1
the 1
key 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
so 1
that 1
Gregor 1
would 1
know 1
he 1
could 1
make 1
things 1
as 1
comfortable 1
for 1
himself 1
as 1
he 1
liked 1
Gregor 1
s 1
little 1
legs 1
whirred 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
could 1
eat 1
What 1
s 1
more 1
his 1
injuries 1
must 1
already 1
have 1
completely 1
healed 1
as 1
he 1
found 1
no 1
difficulty 1
in 1
moving 1
This 1
amazed 1
him 1
as 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
month 1
earlier 1
he 1
had 1
cut 1
his 1
finger 1
slightly 1
with 1
a 1
knife 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
how 1
his 1
finger 1
had 1
still 1
hurt 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
yesterday 1
Am 1
I 1
less 1
sensitive 1
than 1
I 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
then 1
he 1
thought 1
and 1
was 1
already 1
sucking 1
greedily 1
at 1
the 1
cheese 1
which 1
had 1
immediately 1
almost 1
compellingly 1
attracted 1
him 1
much 1
more 1
than 1
the 1
other 1
foods 1
on 1
the 1
newspaper 1
Quickly 1
one 1
after 1
another 1
his 1
eyes 1
watering 1
with 1
pleasure 1
he 1
consumed 1
the 1
cheese 1
the 1
vegetables 1
and 1
the 1
sauce 1
the 1
fresh 1
foods 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
like 1
at 1
all 1
and 1
even 1
dragged 1
the 1
things 1
he 1
did 1
want 1
to 1
eat 1
a 1
little 1
way 1
away 1
from 1
them 1
because 1
he 1
couldn 1
t 1
stand 1
the 1
smell 1
Long 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
finished 1
eating 1
and 1
lay 1
lethargic 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
place 1
his 1
sister 1
slowly 1
turned 1
the 1
key 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
as 1
a 1
sign 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
withdraw 1
He 1
was 1
immediately 1
startled 1
although 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
half 1
asleep 1
and 1
he 1
hurried 1
back 1
under 1
the 1
couch 1
But 1
he 1
needed 1
great 1
self 1
control 1
to 1
stay 1
there 1
even 1
for 1
the 1
short 1
time 1
that 1
his 1
sister 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
as 1
eating 1
so 1
much 1
food 1
had 1
rounded 1
out 1
his 1
body 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
he 1
could 1
hardly 1
breathe 1
in 1
that 1
narrow 1
space 1
Half 1
suffocating 1
he 1
watched 1
with 1
bulging 1
eyes 1
as 1
his 1
sister 1
unselfconsciously 1
took 1
a 1
broom 1
and 1
swept 1
up 1
the 1
left 1
overs 1
mixing 1
them 1
in 1
with 1
the 1
food 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
even 1
touched 1
at 1
all 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
used 1
any 1
more 1
She 1
quickly 1
dropped 1
it 1
all 1
into 1
a 1
bin 1
closed 1
it 1
with 1
its 1
wooden 1
lid 1
and 1
carried 1
everything 1
out 1
She 1
had 1
hardly 1
turned 1
her 1
back 1
before 1
Gregor 1
came 1
out 1
again 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
couch 1
and 1
stretched 1
himself 1
This 1
was 1
how 1
Gregor 1
received 1
his 1
food 1
each 1
day 1
now 1
once 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
while 1
his 1
parents 1
and 1
the 1
maid 1
were 1
still 1
asleep 1
and 1
the 1
second 1
time 1
after 1
everyone 1
had 1
eaten 1
their 1
meal 1
at 1
midday 1
as 1
his 1
parents 1
would 1
sleep 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
then 1
as 1
well 1
and 1
Gregor 1
s 1
sister 1
would 1
send 1
the 1
maid 1
away 1
on 1
some 1
errand 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
certainly 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
him 1
to 1
starve 1
either 1
but 1
perhaps 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
more 1
than 1
they 1
could 1
stand 1
to 1
have 1
any 1
more 1
experience 1
of 1
his 1
feeding 1
than 1
being 1
told 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
perhaps 1
his 1
sister 1
wanted 1
to 1
spare 1
them 1
what 1
distress 1
she 1
could 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
indeed 1
suffering 1
enough 1
It 1
was 1
impossible 1
for 1
Gregor 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
what 1
they 1
had 1
told 1
the 1
doctor 1
and 1
the 1
locksmith 1
that 1
first 1
morning 1
to 1
get 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
flat 1
As 1
nobody 1
could 1
understand 1
him 1
nobody 1
not 1
even 1
his 1
sister 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
understand 1
them 1
so 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
content 1
to 1
hear 1
his 1
sister 1
s 1
sighs 1
and 1
appeals 1
to 1
the 1
saints 1
as 1
she 1
moved 1
about 1
his 1
room 1
It 1
was 1
only 1
later 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
become 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
used 1
to 1
everything 1
there 1
was 1
of 1
course 1
no 1
question 1
of 1
her 1
ever 1
becoming 1
fully 1
used 1
to 1
the 1
situation 1
that 1
Gregor 1
would 1
sometimes 1
catch 1
a 1
friendly 1
comment 1
or 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
comment 1
that 1
could 1
be 1
construed 1
as 1
friendly 1
He 1
s 1
enjoyed 1
his 1
dinner 1
today 1
she 1
might 1
say 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
diligently 1
cleared 1
away 1
all 1
the 1
food 1
left 1
for 1
him 1
or 1
if 1
he 1
left 1
most 1
of 1
it 1
which 1
slowly 1
became 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
frequent 1
she 1
would 1
often 1
say 1
sadly 1
now 1
everything 1
s 1
just 1
been 1
left 1
there 1
again 1
Although 1
Gregor 1
wasn 1
t 1
able 1
to 1
hear 1
any 1
news 1
directly 1
he 1
did 1
listen 1
to 1
much 1
of 1
what 1
was 1
said 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
rooms 1
and 1
whenever 1
he 1
heard 1
anyone 1
speaking 1
he 1
would 1
scurry 1
straight 1
to 1
the 1
appropriate 1
door 1
and 1
press 1
his 1
whole 1
body 1
against 1
it 1
There 1
was 1
seldom 1
any 1
conversation 1
especially 1
at 1
first 1
that 1
was 1
not 1
about 1
him 1
in 1
some 1
way 1
even 1
if 1
only 1
in 1
secret 1
For 1
two 1
whole 1
days 1
all 1
the 1
talk 1
at 1
every 1
mealtime 1
was 1
about 1
what 1
they 1
should 1
do 1
now 1
but 1
even 1
between 1
meals 1
they 1
spoke 1
about 1
the 1
same 1
subject 1
as 1
there 1
were 1
always 1
at 1
least 1
two 1
members 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
at 1
home 1
nobody 1
wanted 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
home 1
by 1
themselves 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
question 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
flat 1
entirely 1
empty 1
And 1
on 1
the 1
very 1
first 1
day 1
the 1
maid 1
had 1
fallen 1
to 1
her 1
knees 1
and 1
begged 1
Gregor 1
s 1
mother 1
to 1
let 1
her 1
go 1
without 1
delay 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
very 1
clear 1
how 1
much 1
she 1
knew 1
of 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
but 1
she 1
left 1
within 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
tearfully 1
thanking 1
Gregor 1
s 1
mother 1
for 1
her 1
dismissal 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
her 1
an 1
enormous 1
service 1
She 1
even 1
swore 1
emphatically 1
not 1
to 1
tell 1
anyone 1
the 1
slightest 1
about 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
even 1
though 1
no 1
one 1
had 1
asked 1
that 1
of 1
her 1
Now 1
Gregor 1
s 1
sister 1
also 1
had 1
to 1
help 1
his 1
mother 1
with 1
the 1
cooking 1
although 1
that 1
was 1
not 1
so 1
much 1
bother 1
as 1
no 1
one 1
ate 1
very 1
much 1
Gregor 1
often 1
heard 1
how 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
would 1
unsuccessfully 1
urge 1
another 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
receive 1
no 1
more 1
answer 1
than 1
no 1
thanks 1
I 1
ve 1
had 1
enough 1
or 1
something 1
similar 1
No 1
one 1
drank 1
very 1
much 1
either 1
His 1
sister 1
would 1
sometimes 1
ask 1
his 1
father 1
whether 1
he 1
would 1
like 1
a 1
beer 1
hoping 1
for 1
the 1
chance 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
fetch 1
it 1
herself 1
When 1
his 1
father 1
then 1
said 1
nothing 1
she 1
would 1
add 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
feel 1
selfish 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
send 1
the 1
housekeeper 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
then 1
his 1
father 1
would 1
close 1
the 1
matter 1
with 1
a 1
big 1
loud 1
No 1
and 1
no 1
more 1
would 1
be 1
said 1
Even 1
before 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
his 1
father 1
had 1
explained 1
to 1
Gregor 1
s 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
what 1
their 1
finances 1
and 1
prospects 1
were 1
Now 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
stood 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
took 1
some 1
receipt 1
or 1
document 1
from 1
the 1
little 1
cash 1
box 1
he 1
had 1
saved 1
from 1
his 1
business 1
when 1
it 1
had 1
collapsed 1
five 1
years 1
earlier 1
Gregor 1
heard 1
how 1
he 1
opened 1
the 1
complicated 1
lock 1
and 1
then 1
closed 1
it 1
again 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
the 1
item 1
he 1
wanted 1
What 1
he 1
heard 1
his 1
father 1
say 1
was 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
good 1
news 1
that 1
Gregor 1
heard 1
since 1
he 1
had 1
first 1
been 1
incarcerated 1
in 1
his 1
room 1
He 1
had 1
thought 1
that 1
nothing 1
at 1
all 1
remained 1
from 1
his 1
father 1
s 1
business 1
at 1
least 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
told 1
him 1
anything 1
different 1
and 1
Gregor 1
had 1
never 1
asked 1
him 1
about 1
it 1
anyway 1
Their 1
business 1
misfortune 1
had 1
reduced 1
the 1
family 1
to 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
total 1
despair 1
and 1
Gregor 1
s 1
only 1
concern 1
at 1
that 1
time 1
had 1
been 1
to 1
arrange 1
things 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
could 1
all 1
forget 1
about 1
it 1
as 1
quickly 1
as 1
possible 1
So 1
then 1
he 1
started 1
working 1
especially 1
hard 1
with 1
a 1
fiery 1
vigour 1
that 1
raised 1
him 1
from 1
a 1
junior 1
salesman 1
to 1
a 1
travelling 1
representative 1
almost 1
overnight 1
bringing 1
with 1
it 1
the 1
chance 1
to 1
earn 1
money 1
in 1
quite 1
different 1
ways 1
Gregor 1
converted 1
his 1
success 1
at 1
work 1
straight 1
into 1
cash 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
at 1
home 1
for 1
the 1
benefit 1
of 1
his 1
astonished 1
and 1
delighted 1
family 1
They 1
had 1
been 1
good 1
times 1
and 1
they 1
had 1
never 1
come 1
again 1
at 1
least 1
not 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
splendour 1
even 1
though 1
Gregor 1
had 1
later 1
earned 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
position 1
to 1
bear 1
the 1
costs 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
family 1
and 1
did 1
bear 1
them 1
They 1
had 1
even 1
got 1
used 1
to 1
it 1
both 1
Gregor 1
and 1
the 1
family 1
they 1
took 1
the 1
money 1
with 1
gratitude 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
glad 1
to 1
provide 1
it 1
although 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
longer 1
much 1
warm 1
affection 1
given 1
in 1
return 1
Gregor 1
only 1
remained 1
close 1
to 1
his 1
sister 1
now 1
Unlike 1
him 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
music 1
and 1
a 1
gifted 1
and 1
expressive 1
violinist 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
secret 1
plan 1
to 1
send 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
conservatory 1
next 1
year 1
even 1
though 1
it 1
would 1
cause 1
great 1
expense 1
that 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
made 1
up 1
for 1
in 1
some 1
other 1
way 1
During 1
Gregor 1
s 1
short 1
periods 1
in 1
town 1
conversation 1
with 1
his 1
sister 1
would 1
often 1
turn 1
to 1
the 1
conservatory 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
ever 1
mentioned 1
as 1
a 1
lovely 1
dream 1
that 1
could 1
never 1
be 1
realised 1
Their 1
parents 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
to 1
hear 1
this 1
innocent 1
talk 1
but 1
Gregor 1
thought 1
about 1
it 1
quite 1
hard 1
and 1
decided 1
he 1
would 1
let 1
them 1
know 1
what 1
he 1
planned 1
with 1
a 1
grand 1
announcement 1
of 1
it 1
on 1
Christmas 1
day 1
That 1
was 1
the 1
sort 1
of 1
totally 1
pointless 1
thing 1
that 1
went 1
through 1
his 1
mind 1
in 1
his 1
present 1
state 1
pressed 1
upright 1
against 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
listening 1
There 1
were 1
times 1
when 1
he 1
simply 1
became 1
too 1
tired 1
to 1
continue 1
listening 1
when 1
his 1
head 1
would 1
fall 1
wearily 1
against 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
pull 1
it 1
up 1
again 1
with 1
a 1
start 1
as 1
even 1
the 1
slightest 1
noise 1
he 1
caused 1
would 1
be 1
heard 1
next 1
door 1
and 1
they 1
would 1
all 1
go 1
silent 1
What 1
s 1
that 1
he 1
s 1
doing 1
now 1
his 1
father 1
would 1
say 1
after 1
a 1
while 1
clearly 1
having 1
gone 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
only 1
then 1
would 1
the 1
interrupted 1
conversation 1
slowly 1
be 1
taken 1
up 1
again 1
When 1
explaining 1
things 1
his 1
father 1
repeated 1
himself 1
several 1
times 1
partly 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
since 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
occupied 1
with 1
these 1
matters 1
himself 1
and 1
partly 1
because 1
Gregor 1
s 1
mother 1
did 1
not 1
understand 1
everything 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
From 1
these 1
repeated 1
explanations 1
Gregor 1
learned 1
to 1
his 1
pleasure 1
that 1
despite 1
all 1
their 1
misfortunes 1
there 1
was 1
still 1
some 1
money 1
available 1
from 1
the 1
old 1
days 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
lot 1
but 1
it 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
touched 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
and 1
some 1
interest 1
had 1
accumulated 1
Besides 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
using 1
up 1
all 1
the 1
money 1
that 1
Gregor 1
had 1
been 1
bringing 1
home 1
every 1
month 1
keeping 1
only 1
a 1
little 1
for 1
himself 1
so 1
that 2
too 1
had 1
been 1
accumulating 1
Behind 1
the 1
door 1
Gregor 1
nodded 1
with 1
enthusiasm 1
in 1
his 1
pleasure 1
at 1
this 1
unexpected 1
thrift 1
and 1
caution 1
He 1
could 1
actually 1
have 1
used 1
this 1
surplus 1
money 1
to 1
reduce 1
his 1
father 1
s 1
debt 1
to 1
his 1
boss 1
and 1
the 1
day 1
when 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
freed 1
himself 1
from 1
that 1
job 1
would 1
have 1
come 1
much 1
closer 1
but 1
now 1
it 1
was 1
certainly 1
better 1
the 1
way 1
his 1
father 1
had 1
done 1
things 1
This 1
money 1
however 1
was 1
certainly 1
not 1
enough 1
to 1
enable 1
the 1
family 1
to 1
live 1
off 1
the 1
interest 1
it 1
was 1
enough 1
to 1
maintain 1
them 1
for 1
perhaps 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
years 1
no 1
more 1
That 1
s 1
to 1
say 1
it 1
was 1
money 1
that 1
should 1
not 1
really 1
be 1
touched 1
but 1
set 1
aside 1
for 1
emergencies 1
money 1
to 1
live 1
on 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
earned 1
His 1
father 1
was 1
healthy 1
but 1
old 1
and 1
lacking 1
in 1
self 1
confidence 1
During 1
the 1
five 1
years 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
working 1
the 1
first 1
holiday 1
in 1
a 1
life 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
full 1
of 1
strain 1
and 1
no 1
success 1
he 1
had 1
put 1
on 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
weight 1
and 1
become 1
very 1
slow 1
and 1
clumsy 1
Would 1
Gregor 1
s 1
elderly 1
mother 1
now 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
earn 1
money 1
She 1
suffered 1
from 1
asthma 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
strain 1
for 1
her 1
just 1
to 1
move 1
about 1
the 1
home 1
every 1
other 1
day 1
would 1
be 1
spent 1
struggling 1
for 1
breath 1
on 1
the 1
sofa 1
by 1
the 1
open 1
window 1
Would 1
his 1
sister 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
earn 1
money 1
She 1
was 1
still 1
a 1
child 1
of 1
seventeen 1
her 1
life 1
up 1
till 1
then 1
had 1
been 1
very 1
enviable 1
consisting 1
of 1
wearing 1
nice 1
clothes 1
sleeping 1
late 1
helping 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
business 1
joining 1
in 1
with 1
a 1
few 1
modest 1
pleasures 1
and 1
most 1
of 1
all 1
playing 1
the 1
violin 1
Whenever 1
they 1
began 1
to 1
talk 1
of 1
the 1
need 1
to 1
earn 1
money 1
Gregor 1
would 1
always 1
first 1
let 1
go 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
then 1
throw 1
himself 1
onto 1
the 1
cool 1
leather 1
sofa 1
next 1
to 1
it 1
as 1
he 1
became 1
quite 1
hot 1
with 1
shame 1
and 1
regret 1
He 1
would 1
often 1
lie 1
there 1
the 1
whole 1
night 1
through 1
not 1
sleeping 1
a 1
wink 1
but 1
scratching 1
at 1
the 1
leather 1
for 1
hours 1
on 1
end 1
Or 1
he 1
might 1
go 1
to 1
all 1
the 1
effort 1
of 1
pushing 1
a 1
chair 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
climbing 1
up 1
onto 1
the 1
sill 1
and 1
propped 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
chair 1
leaning 1
on 1
the 1
window 1
to 1
stare 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
He 1
had 1
used 1
to 1
feel 1
a 1
great 1
sense 1
of 1
freedom 1
from 1
doing 1
this 1
but 1
doing 1
it 1
now 1
was 1
obviously 1
something 1
more 1
remembered 1
than 1
experienced 1
as 1
what 1
he 1
actually 1
saw 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
was 1
becoming 1
less 1
distinct 1
every 1
day 1
even 1
things 1
that 1
were 1
quite 1
near 1
he 1
had 1
used 1
to 1
curse 1
the 1
ever 1
present 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
hospital 1
across 1
the 1
street 1
but 1
now 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
see 1
it 1
at 1
all 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
known 1
that 1
he 1
lived 1
in 1
Charlottenstrasse 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
quiet 1
street 1
despite 1
being 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
looking 1
out 1
the 1
window 1
at 1
a 1
barren 1
waste 1
where 1
the 1
grey 1
sky 1
and 1
the 1
grey 1
earth 1
mingled 1
inseparably 1
His 1
observant 1
sister 1
only 1
needed 1
to 1
notice 1
the 1
chair 1
twice 1
before 1
she 1
would 1
always 1
push 1
it 1
back 1
to 1
its 1
exact 1
position 1
by 1
the 1
window 1
after 1
she 1
had 1
tidied 1
up 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
even 1
left 1
the 1
inner 1
pane 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
open 1
from 1
then 1
on 1
If 1
Gregor 1
had 1
only 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
his 1
sister 1
and 1
thank 1
her 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
for 1
him 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
easier 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
bear 1
it 1
but 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
it 1
caused 1
him 1
pain 1
His 1
sister 1
naturally 1
tried 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
possible 1
to 1
pretend 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
burdensome 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
longer 1
it 1
went 1
on 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
better 1
she 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
but 1
as 1
time 1
went 1
by 1
Gregor 1
was 1
also 1
able 1
to 1
see 1
through 1
it 1
all 1
so 1
much 1
better 1
It 1
had 1
even 1
become 1
very 1
unpleasant 1
for 1
him 1
now 1
whenever 1
she 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
No 1
sooner 1
had 1
she 1
come 1
in 1
than 1
she 1
would 1
quickly 1
close 1
the 1
door 1
as 1
a 1
precaution 1
so 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
suffer 1
the 1
view 1
into 1
Gregor 1
s 1
room 1
then 1
she 1
would 1
go 1
straight 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
pull 1
it 1
hurriedly 1
open 1
almost 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
were 1
suffocating 1
Even 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
cold 1
she 1
would 1
stay 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
breathing 1
deeply 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
She 1
would 1
alarm 1
Gregor 1
twice 1
a 1
day 1
with 1
this 1
running 1
about 1
and 1
noise 1
making 1
he 1
would 1
stay 1
under 1
the 1
couch 1
shivering 1
the 1
whole 1
while 1
knowing 1
full 1
well 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
certainly 1
have 1
liked 1
to 1
spare 1
him 1
this 1
ordeal 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
room 1
with 1
him 1
with 1
the 1
windows 1
closed 1
One 1
day 1
about 1
a 1
month 1
after 1
Gregor 1
s 1
transformation 1
when 1
his 1
sister 1
no 1
longer 1
had 1
any 1
particular 1
reason 1
to 1
be 1
shocked 1
at 1
his 1
appearance 1
she 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
a 1
little 1
earlier 1
than 1
usual 1
and 1
found 1
him 1
still 1
staring 1
out 1
the 1
window 1
motionless 1
and 1
just 1
where 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
most 1
horrible 1
In 1
itself 1
his 1
sister 1
s 1
not 1
coming 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
no 1
surprise 1
for 1
Gregor 1
as 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
difficult 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
immediately 1
open 1
the 1
window 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
still 1
there 1
but 1
not 1
only 1
did 1
she 1
not 1
come 1
in 1
she 1
went 1
straight 1
back 1
and 1
closed 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
her 1
a 1
stranger 1
would 1
have 1
thought 1
he 1
had 1
threatened 1
her 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
bite 1
her 1
Gregor 1
went 1
straight 1
to 1
hide 1
himself 1
under 1
the 1
couch 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
wait 1
until 1
midday 1
before 1
his 1
sister 1
came 1
back 1
and 1
she 1
seemed 1
much 1
more 1
uneasy 1
than 1
usual 1
It 1
made 1
him 1
realise 1
that 1
she 1
still 1
found 1
his 1
appearance 1
unbearable 1
and 1
would 1
continue 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
she 1
probably 1
even 1
had 1
to 1
overcome 1
the 1
urge 1
to 1
flee 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
little 1
bit 1
of 1
him 1
that 1
protruded 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
couch 1
One 1
day 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
spare 1
her 1
even 1
this 1
sight 1
he 1
spent 1
four 1
hours 1
carrying 1
the 1
bedsheet 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
couch 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
and 1
arranged 1
it 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
completely 1
covered 1
and 1
his 1
sister 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
even 1
if 1
she 1
bent 1
down 1
If 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
think 1
this 1
sheet 1
was 1
necessary 1
then 1
all 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
was 1
take 1
it 1
off 1
again 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
clear 1
enough 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
pleasure 1
for 1
Gregor 1
to 1
cut 1
himself 1
off 1
so 1
completely 1
She 1
left 1
the 1
sheet 1
where 1
it 1
was 1
Gregor 1
even 1
thought 1
he 1
glimpsed 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
gratitude 1
one 1
time 1
when 1
he 1
carefully 1
looked 1
out 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
sheet 1
to 1
see 1
how 1
his 1
sister 1
liked 1
the 1
new 1
arrangement 1
For 1
the 1
first 1
fourteen 1
days 1
Gregor 1
s 1
parents 1
could 1
not 1
bring 1
themselves 1
to 1
come 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
He 1
would 1
often 1
hear 1
them 1
say 1
how 1
they 1
appreciated 1
all 1
the 1
new 1
work 1
his 1
sister 1
was 1
doing 1
even 1
though 1
before 1
they 1
had 1
seen 1
her 1
as 1
a 1
girl 1
who 1
was 1
somewhat 1
useless 1
and 1
frequently 1
been 1
annoyed 1
with 1
her 1
But 1
now 1
the 1
two 1
of 1
them 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
would 1
often 1
both 1
wait 1
outside 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
Gregor 1
s 1
room 1
while 1
his 1
sister 1
tidied 1
up 1
in 1
there 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
she 1
went 1
out 1
again 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
tell 1
them 1
exactly 1
how 1
everything 1
looked 1
what 1
Gregor 1
had 1
eaten 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
behaved 1
this 1
time 1
and 1
whether 1
perhaps 1
any 1
slight 1
improvement 1
could 1
be 1
seen 1
His 1
mother 1
also 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
in 1
and 1
visit 1
Gregor 1
relatively 1
soon 1
but 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
sister 1
at 1
first 1
persuaded 1
her 1
against 1
it 1
Gregor 1
listened 1
very 1
closely 1
to 1
all 1
this 1
and 1
approved 1
fully 1
Later 1
though 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
held 1
back 1
by 1
force 1
which 1
made 1
her 1
call 1
out 1
Let 1
me 1
go 1
and 1
see 1
Gregor 1
he 1
is 1
my 1
unfortunate 1
son 1
Can 1
t 1
you 1
understand 1
I 1
have 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
and 1
Gregor 1
would 1
think 1
to 1
himself 1
that 1
maybe 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
better 1
if 1
his 1
mother 1
came 1
in 1
not 1
every 1
day 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
one 1
day 1
a 1
week 1
perhaps 1
she 1
could 1
understand 1
everything 1
much 1
better 1
than 1
his 1
sister 1
who 1
for 1
all 1
her 1
courage 1
was 1
still 1
just 1
a 1
child 1
after 1
all 1
and 1
really 1
might 1
not 1
have 1
had 1
an 1
adult 1
s 1
appreciation 1
of 1
the 1
burdensome 1
job 1
she 1
had 1
taken 1
on 1
Gregor 1
s 1
wish 1
to 1
see 1
his 1
mother 1
was 1
soon 1
realised 1
Out 1
of 1
consideration 1
for 1
his 1
parents 1
Gregor 1
wanted 1
to 1
avoid 1
being 1
seen 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
the 1
few 1
square 1
meters 1
of 1
the 1
floor 1
did 1
not 1
give 1
him 1
much 1
room 1
to 1
crawl 1
about 1
it 1
was 1
hard 1
to 1
just 1
lie 1
quietly 1
through 1
the 1
night 1
his 1
food 1
soon 1
stopped 1
giving 1
him 1
any 1
pleasure 1
at 1
all 1
and 1
so 1
to 1
entertain 1
himself 1
he 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
crawling 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
walls 1
and 1
ceiling 1
He 1
was 1
especially 1
fond 1
of 1
hanging 1
from 1
the 1
ceiling 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
different 1
from 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
he 1
could 1
breathe 1
more 1
freely 1
his 1
body 1
had 1
a 1
light 1
swing 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
up 1
there 1
relaxed 1
and 1
almost 1
happy 1
it 1
might 1
happen 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
surprise 1
even 1
himself 1
by 1
letting 1
go 1
of 1
the 1
ceiling 1
and 1
landing 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
with 1
a 1
crash 1
But 1
now 1
of 1
course 1
he 1
had 1
far 1
better 1
control 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
than 1
before 1
and 1
even 1
with 1
a 1
fall 1
as 1
great 1
as 1
that 1
caused 1
himself 1
no 1
damage 1
Very 1
soon 1
his 1
sister 1
noticed 1
Gregor 1
s 1
new 1
way 1
of 1
entertaining 1
himself 1
he 1
had 1
after 1
all 1
left 1
traces 1
of 1
the 1
adhesive 1
from 1
his 1
feet 1
as 1
he 1
crawled 1
about 1
and 1
got 1
it 1
into 1
her 1
head 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
as 1
easy 1
as 1
possible 1
for 1
him 1
by 1
removing 1
the 1
furniture 1
that 1
got 1
in 1
his 1
way 1
especially 1
the 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
and 1
the 1
desk 1
Now 1
this 1
was 1
not 1
something 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
do 1
by 1
herself 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
dare 1
to 1
ask 1
for 1
help 1
from 1
her 1
father 1
the 1
sixteen 1
year 1
old 1
maid 1
had 1
carried 1
on 1
bravely 1
since 1
the 1
cook 1
had 1
left 1
but 1
she 1
certainly 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
helped 1
in 1
this 1
she 1
had 1
even 1
asked 1
to 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
kitchen 1
locked 1
at 1
all 1
times 1
and 1
never 1
to 1
have 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
unless 1
it 1
was 1
especially 1
important 1
so 1
his 1
sister 1
had 1
no 1
choice 1
but 1
to 1
choose 1
some 1
time 1
when 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
was 1
not 1
there 1
and 1
fetch 1
his 1
mother 1
to 1
help 1
her 1
As 1
she 1
approached 1
the 1
room 1
Gregor 1
could 1
hear 1
his 1
mother 1
express 1
her 1
joy 1
but 1
once 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
she 1
went 1
silent 1
First 1
of 1
course 1
his 1
sister 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
looked 1
round 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
everything 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
was 1
alright 1
and 1
only 1
then 1
did 1
she 1
let 1
her 1
mother 1
enter 1
Gregor 1
had 1
hurriedly 1
pulled 1
the 1
sheet 1
down 1
lower 1
over 1
the 1
couch 1
and 1
put 1
more 1
folds 1
into 1
it 1
so 1
that 1
everything 1
really 1
looked 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
just 1
been 1
thrown 1
down 1
by 1
chance 1
Gregor 1
also 1
refrained 1
this 1
time 1
from 1
spying 1
out 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
sheet 1
he 1
gave 1
up 1
the 1
chance 1
to 1
see 1
his 1
mother 1
until 1
later 1
and 1
was 1
simply 1
glad 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
come 1
You 1
can 1
come 1
in 1
he 1
can 1
t 1
be 1
seen 1
said 1
his 1
sister 1
obviously 1
leading 1
her 1
in 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
The 1
old 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
was 1
too 1
heavy 1
for 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
feeble 1
women 1
to 1
be 1
heaving 1
about 1
but 1
Gregor 1
listened 1
as 1
they 1
pushed 1
it 1
from 1
its 1
place 1
his 1
sister 1
always 1
taking 1
on 1
the 1
heaviest 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
work 1
for 1
herself 1
and 1
ignoring 1
her 1
mother 1
s 1
warnings 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
strain 1
herself 1
This 1
lasted 1
a 1
very 1
long 1
time 1
After 1
labouring 1
at 1
it 1
for 1
fifteen 1
minutes 1
or 1
more 1
his 1
mother 1
said 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
better 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
chest 1
where 1
it 1
was 1
for 1
one 1
thing 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
heavy 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
job 1
finished 1
before 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
got 1
home 1
and 1
leaving 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
in 1
his 1
way 1
even 1
more 1
and 1
for 1
another 1
thing 1
it 1
wasn 1
t 1
even 1
sure 1
that 1
taking 1
the 1
furniture 1
away 1
would 1
really 1
be 1
any 1
help 1
to 1
him 1
She 1
thought 1
just 1
the 1
opposite 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
bare 1
walls 1
saddened 1
her 1
right 1
to 1
her 1
heart 1
and 1
why 1
wouldn 1
t 1
Gregor 1
feel 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
about 1
it 1
he 1
d 1
been 1
used 1
to 1
this 1
furniture 1
in 1
his 1
room 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
and 1
it 1
would 1
make 1
him 1
feel 1
abandoned 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
an 1
empty 1
room 1
like 1
that 1
Then 1
quietly 1
almost 1
whispering 1
as 1
if 1
wanting 1
Gregor 1
whose 1
whereabouts 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
to 1
hear 1
not 1
even 1
the 1
tone 1
of 1
her 1
voice 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
convinced 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
understand 1
her 1
words 1
she 1
added 1
and 1
by 1
taking 1
the 1
furniture 1
away 1
won 1
t 1
it 1
seem 1
like 1
we 1
re 1
showing 1
that 1
we 1
ve 1
given 1
up 1
all 1
hope 1
of 1
improvement 1
and 1
we 1
re 1
abandoning 1
him 1
to 1
cope 1
for 1
himself 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
d 1
be 1
best 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
room 1
exactly 1
the 1
way 1
it 1
was 1
before 1
so 1
that 1
when 1
Gregor 1
comes 1
back 1
to 1
us 1
again 1
he 1
ll 1
find 1
everything 1
unchanged 1
and 1
he 1
ll 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
forget 1
the 1
time 1
in 1
between 1
all 1
the 1
easier 1
Hearing 1
these 1
words 1
from 1
his 1
mother 1
made 1
Gregor 1
realise 1
that 1
the 1
lack 1
of 1
any 1
direct 1
human 1
communication 1
along 1
with 1
the 1
monotonous 1
life 1
led 1
by 1
the 1
family 1
during 1
these 1
two 1
months 1
must 1
have 1
made 1
him 1
confused 1
he 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
no 1
other 1
way 1
of 1
explaining 1
to 1
himself 1
why 1
he 1
had 1
seriously 1
wanted 1
his 1
room 1
emptied 1
out 1
Had 1
he 1
really 1
wanted 1
to 1
transform 1
his 1
room 1
into 1
a 1
cave 1
a 1
warm 1
room 1
fitted 1
out 1
with 1
the 1
nice 1
furniture 1
he 1
had 1
inherited 1
That 1
would 1
have 1
let 1
him 1
crawl 1
around 1
unimpeded 1
in 1
any 1
direction 1
but 1
it 1
would 1
also 1
have 1
let 1
him 1
quickly 1
forget 1
his 1
past 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
still 1
been 1
human 1
He 1
had 1
come 1
very 1
close 1
to 1
forgetting 1
and 1
it 1
had 1
only 1
been 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
his 1
mother 1
unheard 1
for 1
so 1
long 1
that 1
had 1
shaken 1
him 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
Nothing 1
should 1
be 1
removed 1
everything 1
had 1
to 1
stay 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
do 1
without 1
the 1
good 1
influence 1
the 1
furniture 1
had 1
on 1
his 1
condition 1
and 1
if 1
the 1
furniture 1
made 1
it 1
difficult 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
crawl 1
about 1
mindlessly 1
that 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
loss 1
but 1
a 1
great 1
advantage 1
His 1
sister 1
unfortunately 1
did 1
not 1
agree 1
she 1
had 1
become 1
used 1
to 1
the 1
idea 1
not 1
without 1
reason 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
Gregor 1
s 1
spokesman 1
to 1
his 1
parents 1
about 1
the 1
things 1
that 1
concerned 1
him 1
This 1
meant 1
that 1
his 1
mother 1
s 1
advice 1
now 1
was 1
sufficient 1
reason 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
insist 1
on 1
removing 1
not 1
only 1
the 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
and 1
the 1
desk 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
thought 1
at 1
first 1
but 1
all 1
the 1
furniture 1
apart 1
from 1
the 1
all 1
important 1
couch 1
It 1
was 1
more 1
than 1
childish 1
perversity 1
of 1
course 1
or 1
the 1
unexpected 1
confidence 1
she 1
had 1
recently 1
acquired 1
that 1
made 1
her 1
insist 1
she 1
had 1
indeed 1
noticed 1
that 1
Gregor 1
needed 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
room 1
to 1
crawl 1
about 1
in 1
whereas 1
the 1
furniture 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
anyone 1
could 1
see 1
was 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
him 1
at 1
all 1
Girls 1
of 1
that 1
age 1
though 1
do 1
become 1
enthusiastic 1
about 1
things 1
and 1
feel 1
they 1
must 1
get 1
their 1
way 1
whenever 1
they 1
can 1
Perhaps 1
this 1
was 1
what 1
tempted 1
Grete 1
to 1
make 1
Gregor 1
s 1
situation 1
seem 1
even 1
more 1
shocking 1
than 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
do 1
even 1
more 1
for 1
him 1
Grete 1
would 1
probably 1
be 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
who 1
would 1
dare 1
enter 1
a 1
room 1
dominated 1
by 1
Gregor 1
crawling 1
about 1
the 1
bare 1
walls 1
by 1
himself 1
So 1
she 1
refused 1
to 1
let 1
her 1
mother 1
dissuade 1
her 1
Gregor 1
s 1
mother 1
already 1
looked 1
uneasy 1
in 1
his 1
room 1
she 1
soon 1
stopped 1
speaking 1
and 1
helped 1
Gregor 1
s 1
sister 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
out 1
with 1
what 1
strength 1
she 1
had 1
The 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
was 1
something 1
that 1
Gregor 1
could 1
do 1
without 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
but 1
the 1
writing 1
desk 1
had 1
to 1
stay 1
Hardly 1
had 1
the 1
two 1
women 1
pushed 1
the 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
groaning 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
than 1
Gregor 1
poked 1
his 1
head 1
out 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
couch 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
he 1
could 1
do 1
about 1
it 1
He 1
meant 1
to 1
be 1
as 1
careful 1
and 1
considerate 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
but 1
unfortunately 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
mother 1
who 1
came 1
back 1
first 1
while 1
Grete 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
had 1
her 1
arms 1
round 1
the 1
chest 1
pushing 1
and 1
pulling 1
at 1
it 1
from 1
side 1
to 1
side 1
by 1
herself 1
without 1
of 1
course 1
moving 1
it 1
an 1
inch 1
His 1
mother 1
was 1
not 1
used 1
to 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
Gregor 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
made 1
her 1
ill 1
so 1
Gregor 1
hurried 1
backwards 1
to 1
the 1
far 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
couch 1
In 1
his 1
startlement 1
though 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
able 1
to 1
prevent 1
the 1
sheet 1
at 1
its 1
front 1
from 1
moving 1
a 1
little 1
It 1
was 1
enough 1
to 1
attract 1
his 1
mother 1
s 1
attention 1
She 1
stood 1
very 1
still 1
remained 1
there 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
back 1
out 1
to 1
Grete 1
Gregor 1
kept 1
trying 1
to 1
assure 1
himself 1
that 1
nothing 1
unusual 1
was 1
happening 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
a 1
few 1
pieces 1
of 1
furniture 1
being 1
moved 1
after 1
all 1
but 1
he 1
soon 1
had 1
to 1
admit 1
that 1
the 1
women 1
going 1
to 1
and 1
fro 1
their 1
little 1
calls 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
the 1
scraping 1
of 1
the 1
furniture 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
all 1
these 1
things 1
made 1
him 1
feel 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
being 1
assailed 1
from 1
all 1
sides 1
With 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
legs 1
pulled 1
in 1
against 1
him 1
and 1
his 1
body 1
pressed 1
to 1
the 1
floor 1
he 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
admit 1
to 1
himself 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
stand 1
all 1
of 1
this 1
much 1
longer 1
They 1
were 1
emptying 1
his 1
room 1
out 1
taking 1
away 1
everything 1
that 1
was 1
dear 1
to 1
him 1
they 1
had 1
already 1
taken 1
out 1
the 1
chest 1
containing 1
his 1
fretsaw 1
and 1
other 1
tools 1
now 1
they 1
threatened 1
to 1
remove 1
the 1
writing 1
desk 1
with 1
its 1
place 1
clearly 1
worn 1
into 1
the 1
floor 1
the 1
desk 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
his 1
homework 1
as 1
a 1
business 1
trainee 1
at 1
high 1
school 1
even 1
while 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
at 1
infant 1
school 1
he 1
really 1
could 1
not 1
wait 1
any 1
longer 1
to 1
see 1
whether 1
the 1
two 1
women 1
s 1
intentions 1
were 1
good 1
He 1
had 1
nearly 1
forgotten 1
they 1
were 1
there 1
anyway 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
now 1
too 1
tired 1
to 1
say 1
anything 1
while 1
they 1
worked 1
and 1
he 1
could 1
only 1
hear 1
their 1
feet 1
as 1
they 1
stepped 1
heavily 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
So 1
while 1
the 1
women 1
were 1
leant 1
against 1
the 1
desk 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
room 1
catching 1
their 1
breath 1
he 1
sallied 1
out 1
changed 1
direction 1
four 1
times 1
not 1
knowing 1
what 1
he 1
should 1
save 1
first 1
before 1
his 1
attention 1
was 1
suddenly 1
caught 1
by 1
the 1
picture 1
on 1
the 1
wall 1
which 1
was 1
already 1
denuded 1
of 1
everything 1
else 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
on 1
it 1
of 1
the 1
lady 1
dressed 1
in 1
copious 1
fur 1
He 1
hurried 1
up 1
onto 1
the 1
picture 1
and 1
pressed 1
himself 1
against 1
its 1
glass 1
it 1
held 1
him 1
firmly 1
and 1
felt 1
good 1
on 1
his 1
hot 1
belly 1
This 1
picture 1
at 1
least 1
now 1
totally 1
covered 1
by 1
Gregor 1
would 1
certainly 1
be 1
taken 1
away 1
by 1
no 1
one 1
He 1
turned 1
his 1
head 1
to 1
face 1
the 1
door 1
into 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
watch 1
the 1
women 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
back 1
They 1
had 1
not 1
allowed 1
themselves 1
a 1
long 1
rest 1
and 1
came 1
back 1
quite 1
soon 1
Grete 1
had 1
put 1
her 1
arm 1
around 1
her 1
mother 1
and 1
was 1
nearly 1
carrying 1
her 1
What 1
shall 1
we 1
take 1
now 1
then 1
said 1
Grete 1
and 1
looked 1
around 1
Her 1
eyes 1
met 1
those 1
of 1
Gregor 1
on 1
the 1
wall 1
Perhaps 1
only 1
because 1
her 1
mother 1
was 1
there 1
she 1
remained 1
calm 1
bent 1
her 1
face 1
to 1
her 1
so 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
look 1
round 1
and 1
said 1
albeit 1
hurriedly 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
tremor 1
in 1
her 1
voice 1
Come 1
on 1
let 1
s 1
go 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
Gregor 1
could 1
see 1
what 1
Grete 1
had 1
in 1
mind 1
she 1
wanted 1
to 1
take 1
her 1
mother 1
somewhere 1
safe 1
and 1
then 1
chase 1
him 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
wall 1
Well 1
she 1
could 1
certainly 1
try 1
it 1
He 1
sat 1
unyielding 1
on 1
his 1
picture 1
He 1
would 1
rather 1
jump 1
at 1
Grete 1
s 1
face 1
But 1
Grete 1
s 1
words 1
had 1
made 1
her 1
mother 1
quite 1
worried 1
she 1
stepped 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
saw 1
the 1
enormous 1
brown 1
patch 1
against 1
the 1
flowers 1
of 1
the 1
wallpaper 1
and 1
before 1
she 1
even 1
realised 1
it 1
was 1
Gregor 1
that 1
she 1
saw 1
screamed 1
Oh 1
God 1
oh 1
God 1
Arms 1
outstretched 1
she 1
fell 1
onto 1
the 1
couch 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
given 1
up 1
everything 1
and 1
stayed 1
there 1
immobile 1
Gregor 1
shouted 1
his 1
sister 1
glowering 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
shaking 1
her 1
fist 1
That 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
word 1
she 1
had 1
spoken 1
to 1
him 1
directly 1
since 1
his 1
transformation 1
She 1
ran 1
into 1
the 1
other 1
room 1
to 1
fetch 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
smelling 1
salts 1
to 1
bring 1
her 1
mother 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
faint 1
Gregor 1
wanted 1
to 1
help 1
too 1
he 1
could 1
save 1
his 1
picture 1
later 1
although 1
he 1
stuck 1
fast 1
to 1
the 1
glass 1
and 1
had 1
to 1
pull 1
himself 1
off 1
by 1
force 1
then 1
he 1
too 1
ran 1
into 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
advise 1
his 1
sister 1
like 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
days 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
just 1
stand 1
behind 1
her 1
doing 1
nothing 1
she 1
was 1
looking 1
into 1
various 1
bottles 1
he 1
startled 1
her 1
when 1
she 1
turned 1
round 1
a 1
bottle 1
fell 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
broke 1
a 1
splinter 1
cut 1
Gregor 1
s 1
face 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
caustic 1
medicine 1
splashed 1
all 1
over 1
him 1
now 1
without 1
delaying 1
any 1
longer 1
Grete 1
took 1
hold 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
bottles 1
she 1
could 1
and 1
ran 1
with 1
them 1
in 1
to 1
her 1
mother 1
she 1
slammed 1
the 1
door 1
shut 1
with 1
her 1
foot 1
So 1
now 1
Gregor 1
was 1
shut 1
out 1
from 1
his 1
mother 1
who 1
because 1
of 1
him 1
might 1
be 1
near 1
to 1
death 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
chase 1
his 1
sister 1
away 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
stay 1
with 1
his 1
mother 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
wait 1
and 1
oppressed 1
with 1
anxiety 1
and 1
self 1
reproach 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
crawl 1
about 1
he 1
crawled 1
over 1
everything 1
walls 1
furniture 1
ceiling 1
and 1
finally 1
in 1
his 1
confusion 1
as 1
the 1
whole 1
room 1
began 1
to 1
spin 1
around 1
him 1
he 1
fell 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
dinner 1
table 1
He 1
lay 1
there 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
numb 1
and 1
immobile 1
all 1
around 1
him 1
it 1
was 1
quiet 1
maybe 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
sign 1
Then 1
there 1
was 1
someone 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
The 1
maid 1
of 1
course 1
had 1
locked 1
herself 1
in 1
her 1
kitchen 1
so 1
that 1
Grete 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
answer 1
it 1
His 1
father 1
had 1
arrived 1
home 1
What 1
s 1
happened 1
were 1
his 1
first 1
words 1
Grete 1
s 1
appearance 1
must 1
have 1
made 1
everything 1
clear 1
to 1
him 1
She 1
answered 1
him 1
with 1
subdued 1
voice 1
and 1
openly 1
pressed 1
her 1
face 1
into 1
his 1
chest 1
Mother 1
s 1
fainted 1
but 1
she 1
s 1
better 1
now 1
Gregor 1
got 1
out 1
Just 1
as 1
I 1
expected 1
said 1
his 1
father 1
just 1
as 1
I 1
always 1
said 1
but 1
you 1
women 1
wouldn 1
t 1
listen 1
would 1
you 1
It 1
was 1
clear 1
to 1
Gregor 1
that 1
Grete 1
had 1
not 1
said 1
enough 1
and 1
that 1
his 1
father 1
took 1
it 1
to 1
mean 1
that 1
something 1
bad 1
had 1
happened 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
responsible 1
for 1
some 1
act 1
of 1
violence 1
That 1
meant 1
Gregor 1
would 1
now 1
have 1
to 1
try 1
to 1
calm 1
his 1
father 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
have 1
the 1
time 1
to 1
explain 1
things 1
to 1
him 1
even 1
if 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
possible 1
So 1
he 1
fled 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
his 1
room 1
and 1
pressed 1
himself 1
against 1
it 1
so 1
that 1
his 1
father 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
in 1
from 1
the 1
hall 1
could 1
see 1
straight 1
away 1
that 1
Gregor 1
had 1
the 1
best 1
intentions 1
and 1
would 1
go 1
back 1
into 1
his 1
room 1
without 1
delay 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
necessary 1
to 1
drive 1
him 1
back 1
but 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
only 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
disappear 1
His 1
father 1
though 1
was 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
mood 1
to 1
notice 1
subtleties 1
like 1
that 1
Ah 1
he 1
shouted 1
as 1
he 1
came 1
in 1
sounding 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
both 1
angry 1
and 1
glad 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
Gregor 1
drew 1
his 1
head 1
back 1
from 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
lifted 1
it 1
towards 1
his 1
father 1
He 1
really 1
had 1
not 1
imagined 1
his 1
father 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
stood 1
there 1
now 1
of 1
late 1
with 1
his 1
new 1
habit 1
of 1
crawling 1
about 1
he 1
had 1
neglected 1
to 1
pay 1
attention 1
to 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
flat 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
before 1
He 1
really 1
ought 1
to 1
have 1
expected 1
things 1
to 1
have 1
changed 1
but 1
still 2
was 1
that 1
really 1
his 1
father 1
The 1
same 1
tired 1
man 1
as 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
laying 1
there 1
entombed 1
in 1
his 1
bed 1
when 1
Gregor 1
came 1
back 1
from 1
his 1
business 1
trips 1
who 1
would 1
receive 1
him 1
sitting 1
in 1
the 1
armchair 1
in 1
his 1
nightgown 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
evenings 1
who 1
was 1
hardly 1
even 1
able 1
to 1
stand 1
up 1
but 1
as 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
his 1
pleasure 1
would 1
just 1
raise 1
his 1
arms 1
and 1
who 1
on 1
the 1
couple 1
of 1
times 1
a 1
year 1
when 1
they 1
went 1
for 1
a 1
walk 1
together 1
on 1
a 1
Sunday 1
or 1
public 1
holiday 1
wrapped 1
up 1
tightly 1
in 1
his 1
overcoat 1
between 1
Gregor 1
and 1
his 1
mother 1
would 1
always 1
labour 1
his 1
way 1
forward 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
slowly 1
than 1
them 1
who 1
were 1
already 1
walking 1
slowly 1
for 1
his 1
sake 1
who 1
would 1
place 1
his 1
stick 1
down 1
carefully 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
say 1
something 1
would 1
invariably 1
stop 1
and 1
gather 1
his 1
companions 1
around 1
him 1
He 1
was 1
standing 1
up 1
straight 1
enough 1
now 1
dressed 1
in 1
a 1
smart 1
blue 1
uniform 1
with 1
gold 1
buttons 1
the 1
sort 1
worn 1
by 1
the 1
employees 1
at 1
the 1
banking 1
institute 1
above 1
the 1
high 1
stiff 1
collar 1
of 1
the 1
coat 1
his 1
strong 1
double 1
chin 1
emerged 1
under 1
the 1
bushy 1
eyebrows 1
his 1
piercing 1
dark 1
eyes 1
looked 1
out 1
fresh 1
and 1
alert 1
his 1
normally 1
unkempt 1
white 1
hair 1
was 1
combed 1
down 1
painfully 1
close 1
to 1
his 1
scalp 1
He 1
took 1
his 1
cap 1
with 1
its 1
gold 1
monogram 1
from 1
probably 1
some 1
bank 1
and 1
threw 1
it 1
in 1
an 1
arc 1
right 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
onto 1
the 1
sofa 1
put 1
his 1
hands 1
in 1
his 1
trouser 1
pockets 1
pushing 1
back 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
his 1
long 1
uniform 1
coat 1
and 1
with 1
look 1
of 1
determination 1
walked 1
towards 1
Gregor 1
He 1
probably 1
did 1
not 1
even 1
know 1
himself 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
in 1
mind 1
but 1
nonetheless 1
lifted 1
his 1
feet 1
unusually 1
high 1
Gregor 1
was 1
amazed 1
at 1
the 1
enormous 1
size 1
of 1
the 1
soles 1
of 1
his 1
boots 1
but 1
wasted 1
no 1
time 1
with 1
that 1
he 1
knew 1
full 1
well 1
right 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
of 1
his 1
new 1
life 1
that 1
his 1
father 1
thought 1
it 1
necessary 1
to 1
always 1
be 1
extremely 1
strict 1
with 1
him 1
And 1
so 1
he 1
ran 1
up 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
stopped 1
when 1
his 1
father 1
stopped 1
scurried 1
forwards 1
again 1
when 1
he 1
moved 1
even 1
slightly 1
In 1
this 1
way 1
they 1
went 1
round 1
the 1
room 1
several 1
times 1
without 1
anything 1
decisive 1
happening 1
without 1
even 1
giving 1
the 1
impression 1
of 1
a 1
chase 1
as 1
everything 1
went 1
so 1
slowly 1
Gregor 1
remained 1
all 1
this 1
time 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
largely 1
because 1
he 1
feared 1
his 1
father 1
might 1
see 1
it 1
as 1
especially 1
provoking 1
if 1
he 1
fled 1
onto 1
the 1
wall 1
or 1
ceiling 1
Whatever 1
he 1
did 1
Gregor 1
had 1
to 1
admit 1
that 1
he 1
certainly 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
keep 1
up 1
this 1
running 1
about 1
for 1
long 1
as 1
for 1
each 1
step 1
his 1
father 1
took 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
carry 1
out 1
countless 1
movements 1
He 1
became 1
noticeably 1
short 1
of 1
breath 1
even 1
in 1
his 1
earlier 1
life 1
his 1
lungs 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
very 1
reliable 1
Now 1
as 1
he 1
lurched 1
about 1
in 1
his 1
efforts 1
to 1
muster 1
all 1
the 1
strength 1
he 1
could 1
for 1
running 1
he 1
could 1
hardly 1
keep 1
his 1
eyes 1
open 1
his 1
thoughts 1
became 1
too 1
slow 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
any 1
other 1
way 1
of 1
saving 1
himself 1
than 1
running 1
he 1
almost 1
forgot 1
that 1
the 1
walls 1
were 1
there 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
use 1
although 1
here 1
they 1
were 1
concealed 1
behind 1
carefully 1
carved 1
furniture 1
full 1
of 1
notches 1
and 1
protrusions 1
then 1
right 1
beside 1
him 1
lightly 1
tossed 1
something 1
flew 1
down 1
and 1
rolled 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
It 1
was 1
an 1
apple 1
then 1
another 1
one 1
immediately 1
flew 1
at 1
him 1
Gregor 1
froze 1
in 1
shock 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
longer 1
any 1
point 1
in 1
running 1
as 1
his 1
father 1
had 1
decided 1
to 1
bombard 1
him 1
He 1
had 1
filled 1
his 1
pockets 1
with 1
fruit 1
from 1
the 1
bowl 1
on 1
the 1
sideboard 1
and 1
now 1
without 1
even 1
taking 1
the 1
time 1
for 1
careful 1
aim 1
threw 1
one 1
apple 1
after 1
another 1
These 1
little 1
red 1
apples 1
rolled 1
about 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
knocking 1
into 1
each 1
other 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
electric 1
motors 1
An 1
apple 1
thrown 1
without 1
much 1
force 1
glanced 1
against 1
Gregor 1
s 1
back 1
and 1
slid 1
off 1
without 1
doing 1
any 1
harm 1
Another 1
one 1
however 1
immediately 1
following 1
it 1
hit 1
squarely 1
and 1
lodged 1
in 1
his 1
back 1
Gregor 1
wanted 1
to 1
drag 1
himself 1
away 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
remove 1
the 1
surprising 1
the 1
incredible 1
pain 1
by 1
changing 1
his 1
position 1
but 1
he 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
nailed 1
to 1
the 1
spot 1
and 1
spread 1
himself 1
out 1
all 1
his 1
senses 1
in 1
confusion 1
The 1
last 1
thing 1
he 1
saw 1
was 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
his 1
room 1
being 1
pulled 1
open 1
his 1
sister 1
was 1
screaming 1
his 1
mother 1
ran 1
out 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
her 1
in 1
her 1
blouse 1
as 1
his 1
sister 1
had 1
taken 1
off 1
some 1
of 1
her 1
clothes 1
after 1
she 1
had 1
fainted 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
easier 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
breathe 1
she 1
ran 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
her 1
skirts 1
unfastened 1
and 1
sliding 1
one 1
after 1
another 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
stumbling 1
over 1
the 1
skirts 1
she 1
pushed 1
herself 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
her 1
arms 1
around 1
him 1
uniting 1
herself 1
with 1
him 1
totally 1
now 1
Gregor 1
lost 1
his 1
ability 1
to 1
see 1
anything 1
her 1
hands 1
behind 1
his 1
father 1
s 1
head 1
begging 1
him 1
to 1
spare 1
Gregor 1
s 1
life 1
III 1
No 1
one 1
dared 1
to 1
remove 1
the 1
apple 1
lodged 1
in 1
Gregor 1
s 1
flesh 1
so 1
it 1
remained 1
there 1
as 1
a 1
visible 1
reminder 1
of 1
his 1
injury 1
He 1
had 1
suffered 1
it 1
there 1
for 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
month 1
and 1
his 1
condition 1
seemed 1
serious 1
enough 1
to 1
remind 1
even 1
his 1
father 1
that 1
Gregor 1
despite 1
his 1
current 1
sad 1
and 1
revolting 1
form 1
was 1
a 1
family 1
member 1
who 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
treated 1
as 1
an 1
enemy 1
On 1
the 1
contrary 1
as 1
a 1
family 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
duty 1
to 1
swallow 1
any 1
revulsion 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
to 1
be 1
patient 1
just 1
to 1
be 1
patient 1
Because 1
of 1
his 1
injuries 1
Gregor 1
had 1
lost 1
much 1
of 1
his 1
mobility 1
probably 1
permanently 1
He 1
had 1
been 1
reduced 1
to 1
the 1
condition 1
of 1
an 1
ancient 1
invalid 1
and 1
it 1
took 1
him 1
long 2
minutes 1
to 1
crawl 1
across 1
his 1
room 1
crawling 1
over 1
the 1
ceiling 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
question 1
but 1
this 1
deterioration 1
in 1
his 1
condition 1
was 1
fully 1
in 1
his 1
opinion 1
made 1
up 1
for 1
by 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
being 1
left 1
open 1
every 1
evening 1
He 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
closely 1
watching 1
it 1
for 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
hours 1
before 1
it 1
was 1
opened 1
and 1
then 1
lying 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
of 1
his 1
room 1
where 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
seen 1
from 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
he 1
could 1
watch 1
the 1
family 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
dinner 1
table 1
and 1
listen 1
to 1
their 1
conversation 1
with 1
everyone 1
s 1
permission 1
in 1
a 1
way 1
and 1
thus 1
quite 1
differently 1
from 1
before 1
They 1
no 1
longer 1
held 1
the 1
lively 1
conversations 1
of 1
earlier 1
times 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
ones 1
that 1
Gregor 1
always 1
thought 1
about 1
with 1
longing 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
tired 1
and 1
getting 1
into 1
the 1
damp 1
bed 1
in 1
some 1
small 1
hotel 1
room 1
All 1
of 1
them 1
were 1
usually 1
very 1
quiet 1
nowadays 1
Soon 1
after 1
dinner 1
his 1
father 1
would 1
go 1
to 1
sleep 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
his 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
would 1
urge 1
each 1
other 1
to 1
be 1
quiet 1
his 1
mother 1
bent 1
deeply 1
under 1
the 1
lamp 1
would 1
sew 1
fancy 1
underwear 1
for 1
a 1
fashion 1
shop 1
his 1
sister 1
who 1
had 1
taken 1
a 1
sales 1
job 1
learned 1
shorthand 1
and 1
French 1
in 1
the 1
evenings 1
so 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
better 1
position 1
later 1
on 1
Sometimes 1
his 1
father 1
would 1
wake 1
up 1
and 1
say 1
to 1
Gregor 1
s 1
mother 1
you 1
re 1
doing 1
so 1
much 1
sewing 1
again 1
today 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
dozing 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
would 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
sleep 1
again 1
while 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
would 1
exchange 1
a 1
tired 1
grin 1
With 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
stubbornness 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
refused 1
to 1
take 1
his 1
uniform 1
off 1
even 1
at 1
home 1
while 1
his 1
nightgown 1
hung 1
unused 1
on 1
its 1
peg 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
would 1
slumber 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
fully 1
dressed 1
as 1
if 1
always 1
ready 1
to 1
serve 1
and 1
expecting 1
to 1
hear 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
his 1
superior 1
even 1
here 1
The 1
uniform 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
new 1
to 1
start 1
with 1
but 1
as 1
a 1
result 1
of 1
this 1
it 1
slowly 1
became 1
even 1
shabbier 1
despite 1
the 1
efforts 1
of 1
Gregor 1
s 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
to 1
look 1
after 1
it 1
Gregor 1
would 1
often 1
spend 1
the 1
whole 1
evening 1
looking 1
at 1
all 1
the 1
stains 1
on 1
this 1
coat 1
with 1
its 1
gold 1
buttons 1
always 1
kept 1
polished 1
and 1
shiny 1
while 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
in 1
it 1
would 1
sleep 1
highly 1
uncomfortable 1
but 1
peaceful 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
it 1
struck 1
ten 1
Gregor 1
s 1
mother 1
would 1
speak 1
gently 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
to 1
wake 1
him 1
and 1
try 1
to 1
persuade 1
him 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
bed 1
as 1
he 1
couldn 1
t 1
sleep 1
properly 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
and 1
he 1
really 1
had 1
to 1
get 1
his 1
sleep 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
up 1
at 1
six 1
to 1
get 1
to 1
work 1
But 1
since 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
work 1
he 1
had 1
become 1
more 1
obstinate 1
and 1
would 1
always 1
insist 1
on 1
staying 1
longer 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
even 1
though 1
he 1
regularly 1
fell 1
asleep 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
then 1
harder 1
than 1
ever 1
to 1
persuade 1
him 1
to 1
exchange 1
the 1
chair 1
for 1
his 1
bed 1
Then 1
however 1
much 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
would 1
importune 1
him 1
with 1
little 1
reproaches 1
and 1
warnings 1
he 1
would 1
keep 1
slowly 1
shaking 1
his 1
head 1
for 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
with 1
his 1
eyes 1
closed 1
and 1
refusing 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
Gregor 1
s 1
mother 1
would 1
tug 1
at 1
his 1
sleeve 1
whisper 1
endearments 1
into 1
his 1
ear 1
Gregor 1
s 1
sister 1
would 1
leave 1
her 1
work 1
to 1
help 1
her 1
mother 1
but 1
nothing 1
would 1
have 1
any 1
effect 1
on 1
him 1
He 1
would 1
just 1
sink 1
deeper 1
into 1
his 1
chair 1
Only 1
when 1
the 1
two 1
women 1
took 1
him 1
under 1
the 1
arms 1
he 1
would 1
abruptly 1
open 1
his 1
eyes 1
look 1
at 1
them 1
one 1
after 1
the 1
other 1
and 1
say 1
What 1
a 1
life 1
This 1
is 1
what 1
peace 1
I 1
get 1
in 1
my 1
old 1
age 1
And 1
supported 1
by 1
the 1
two 1
women 1
he 1
would 1
lift 1
himself 1
up 1
carefully 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
carrying 1
the 1
greatest 1
load 1
himself 1
let 1
the 1
women 1
take 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
send 1
them 1
off 1
and 1
carry 1
on 1
by 1
himself 1
while 1
Gregor 1
s 1
mother 1
would 1
throw 1
down 1
her 1
needle 1
and 1
his 1
sister 1
her 1
pen 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
could 1
run 1
after 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
continue 1
being 1
of 1
help 1
to 1
him 1
Who 1
in 1
this 1
tired 1
and 1
overworked 1
family 1
would 1
have 1
had 1
time 1
to 1
give 1
more 1
attention 1
to 1
Gregor 1
than 1
was 1
absolutely 1
necessary 1
The 1
household 1
budget 1
became 1
even 1
smaller 1
so 1
now 1
the 1
maid 1
was 1
dismissed 1
an 1
enormous 1
thick 1
boned 1
charwoman 1
with 1
white 1
hair 1
that 1
flapped 1
around 1
her 1
head 1
came 1
every 1
morning 1
and 1
evening 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
heaviest 1
work 1
everything 1
else 1
was 1
looked 1
after 1
by 1
Gregor 1
s 1
mother 1
on 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
large 1
amount 1
of 1
sewing 1
work 1
she 1
did 1
Gregor 1
even 1
learned 1
listening 1
to 1
the 1
evening 1
conversation 1
about 1
what 1
price 1
they 1
had 1
hoped 1
for 1
that 1
several 1
items 1
of 1
jewellery 1
belonging 1
to 1
the 1
family 1
had 1
been 1
sold 1
even 1
though 1
both 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
had 1
been 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
wearing 1
them 1
at 1
functions 1
and 1
celebrations 1
But 1
the 1
loudest 1
complaint 1
was 1
that 1
although 1
the 1
flat 1
was 1
much 1
too 1
big 1
for 1
their 1
present 1
circumstances 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
move 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
imaginable 1
way 1
of 1
transferring 1
Gregor 1
to 1
the 1
new 1
address 1
He 1
could 1
see 1
quite 1
well 1
though 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
more 1
reasons 1
than 1
consideration 1
for 1
him 1
that 1
made 1
it 1
difficult 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
move 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
quite 1
easy 1
to 1
transport 1
him 1
in 1
any 1
suitable 1
crate 1
with 1
a 1
few 1
air 1
holes 1
in 1
it 1
the 1
main 1
thing 1
holding 1
the 1
family 1
back 1
from 1
their 1
decision 1
to 1
move 1
was 1
much 1
more 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
their 1
total 1
despair 1
and 1
the 1
thought 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
struck 1
with 1
a 1
misfortune 1
unlike 1
anything 1
experienced 1
by 1
anyone 1
else 1
they 1
knew 1
or 1
were 1
related 1
to 1
They 1
carried 1
out 1
absolutely 1
everything 1
that 1
the 1
world 1
expects 1
from 1
poor 1
people 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
brought 1
bank 1
employees 1
their 1
breakfast 1
his 1
mother 1
sacrificed 1
herself 1
by 1
washing 1
clothes 1
for 1
strangers 1
his 1
sister 1
ran 1
back 1
and 1
forth 1
behind 1
her 1
desk 1
at 1
the 1
behest 1
of 1
the 1
customers 1
but 1
they 1
just 1
did 1
not 1
have 1
the 1
strength 1
to 1
do 1
any 1
more 1
And 1
the 1
injury 1
in 1
Gregor 1
s 1
back 1
began 1
to 1
hurt 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
new 1
After 1
they 1
had 1
come 1
back 1
from 1
taking 1
his 1
father 1
to 1
bed 1
Gregor 1
s 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
would 1
now 1
leave 1
their 1
work 1
where 1
it 1
was 1
and 1
sit 1
close 1
together 1
cheek 1
to 1
cheek 1
his 1
mother 1
would 1
point 1
to 1
Gregor 1
s 1
room 1
and 1
say 1
Close 1
that 1
door 1
Grete 1
and 1
then 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
again 1
they 1
would 1
sit 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
and 1
their 1
tears 1
would 1
mingle 1
or 1
they 1
would 1
simply 1
sit 1
there 1
staring 1
dry 1
eyed 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
Gregor 1
hardly 1
slept 1
at 1
all 1
either 1
night 1
or 1
day 1
Sometimes 1
he 1
would 1
think 1
of 1
taking 1
over 1
the 1
family 1
s 1
affairs 1
just 1
like 1
before 1
the 1
next 1
time 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
opened 1
he 1
had 1
long 1
forgotten 1
about 1
his 1
boss 1
and 1
the 1
chief 1
clerk 1
but 1
they 1
would 1
appear 1
again 1
in 1
his 1
thoughts 1
the 1
salesmen 1
and 1
the 1
apprentices 1
that 1
stupid 1
teaboy 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
friends 1
from 1
other 1
businesses 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
chambermaids 1
from 1
a 1
provincial 1
hotel 1
a 1
tender 1
memory 1
that 1
appeared 1
and 1
disappeared 1
again 1
a 1
cashier 1
from 1
a 1
hat 1
shop 1
for 1
whom 1
his 1
attention 1
had 1
been 1
serious 1
but 1
too 1
slow 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
appeared 1
to 1
him 1
mixed 1
together 1
with 1
strangers 1
and 1
others 1
he 1
had 1
forgotten 1
but 1
instead 1
of 1
helping 1
him 1
and 1
his 1
family 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
inaccessible 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
glad 1
when 1
they 1
disappeared 1
Other 1
times 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
in 1
the 1
mood 1
to 1
look 1
after 1
his 1
family 1
he 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
simple 1
rage 1
about 1
the 1
lack 1
of 1
attention 1
he 1
was 1
shown 1
and 1
although 1
he 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
nothing 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
wanted 1
he 1
made 1
plans 1
of 1
how 1
he 1
could 1
get 1
into 1
the 1
pantry 1
where 1
he 1
could 1
take 1
all 1
the 1
things 1
he 1
was 1
entitled 1
to 1
even 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
hungry 1
Gregor 1
s 1
sister 1
no 1
longer 1
thought 1
about 1
how 1
she 1
could 1
please 1
him 1
but 1
would 1
hurriedly 1
push 1
some 1
food 1
or 1
other 1
into 1
his 1
room 1
with 1
her 1
foot 1
before 1
she 1
rushed 1
out 1
to 1
work 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
at 1
midday 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
she 1
would 1
sweep 1
it 1
away 1
again 1
with 1
the 1
broom 1
indifferent 1
as 1
to 1
whether 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
eaten 1
or 1
more 1
often 1
than 1
not 1
had 1
been 1
left 1
totally 1
untouched 1
She 1
still 1
cleared 1
up 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
but 1
now 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
any 1
quicker 1
about 1
it 1
Smears 1
of 1
dirt 1
were 1
left 1
on 1
the 1
walls 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
were 1
little 1
balls 1
of 1
dust 1
and 1
filth 1
At 1
first 1
Gregor 1
went 1
into 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
worst 1
of 1
these 1
places 1
when 1
his 1
sister 1
arrived 1
as 1
a 1
reproach 1
to 1
her 1
but 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
stayed 1
there 1
for 1
weeks 1
without 1
his 1
sister 1
doing 1
anything 1
about 1
it 1
she 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
dirt 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
but 1
she 1
had 1
simply 1
decided 1
to 1
leave 1
him 1
to 1
it 1
At 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
she 1
became 1
touchy 1
in 1
a 1
way 1
that 1
was 1
quite 1
new 1
for 1
her 1
and 1
which 1
everyone 1
in 1
the 1
family 1
understood 1
cleaning 1
up 1
Gregor 1
s 1
room 1
was 1
for 1
her 1
and 1
her 1
alone 1
Gregor 1
s 1
mother 1
did 1
once 1
thoroughly 1
clean 1
his 1
room 1
and 1
needed 1
to 1
use 1
several 1
bucketfuls 1
of 1
water 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
although 1
that 1
much 1
dampness 1
also 1
made 1
Gregor 1
ill 1
and 1
he 1
lay 1
flat 1
on 1
the 1
couch 1
bitter 1
and 1
immobile 1
But 1
his 1
mother 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
punished 1
still 1
more 1
for 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
as 1
hardly 1
had 1
his 1
sister 1
arrived 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
than 1
she 1
noticed 1
the 1
change 1
in 1
Gregor 1
s 1
room 1
and 1
highly 1
aggrieved 1
ran 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
where 1
despite 1
her 1
mothers 1
raised 1
and 1
imploring 1
hands 1
she 1
broke 1
into 1
convulsive 1
tears 1
Her 1
father 1
of 1
course 1
was 1
startled 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
parents 1
looked 1
on 1
astonished 1
and 1
helpless 1
then 1
they 1
too 1
became 1
agitated 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
standing 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
of 1
his 1
mother 1
accused 1
her 1
of 1
not 1
leaving 1
the 1
cleaning 1
of 1
Gregor 1
s 1
room 1
to 1
his 1
sister 1
from 1
her 1
left 1
Gregor 1
s 1
sister 1
screamed 1
at 1
her 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
never 1
to 1
clean 1
Gregor 1
s 1
room 1
again 1
while 1
his 1
mother 1
tried 1
to 1
draw 1
his 1
father 1
who 1
was 1
beside 1
himself 1
with 1
anger 1
into 1
the 1
bedroom 1
his 1
sister 1
quaking 1
with 1
tears 1
thumped 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
with 1
her 1
small 1
fists 1
and 1
Gregor 1
hissed 1
in 1
anger 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
had 1
even 1
thought 1
of 1
closing 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
save 1
him 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
this 1
and 1
all 1
its 1
noise 1
Gregor 1
s 1
sister 1
was 1
exhausted 1
from 1
going 1
out 1
to 1
work 1
and 1
looking 1
after 1
Gregor 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
before 1
was 1
even 1
more 1
work 1
for 1
her 1
but 1
even 1
so 1
his 1
mother 1
ought 1
certainly 1
not 1
to 1
have 1
taken 1
her 1
place 1
Gregor 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
ought 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
neglected 1
Now 1
though 1
the 1
charwoman 1
was 1
here 1
This 1
elderly 1
widow 1
with 1
a 1
robust 1
bone 1
structure 1
that 1
made 1
her 1
able 1
to 1
withstand 1
the 1
hardest 1
of 1
things 1
in 1
her 1
long 1
life 1
wasn 1
t 1
really 1
repelled 1
by 1
Gregor 1
Just 1
by 1
chance 1
one 1
day 1
rather 1
than 1
any 1
real 1
curiosity 1
she 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
Gregor 1
s 1
room 1
and 1
found 1
herself 1
face 1
to 1
face 1
with 1
him 1
He 1
was 1
taken 1
totally 1
by 1
surprise 1
no 1
one 1
was 1
chasing 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
rush 1
to 1
and 1
fro 1
while 1
she 1
just 1
stood 1
there 1
in 1
amazement 1
with 1
her 1
hands 1
crossed 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
her 1
From 1
then 1
on 1
she 1
never 1
failed 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
slightly 1
every 1
evening 1
and 1
morning 1
and 1
look 1
briefly 1
in 1
on 1
him 1
At 1
first 1
she 1
would 1
call 1
to 1
him 1
as 1
she 1
did 1
so 1
with 1
words 1
that 1
she 1
probably 1
considered 1
friendly 1
such 1
as 1
come 1
on 1
then 1
you 1
old 1
dung 1
beetle 1
or 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
old 1
dung 1
beetle 1
there 1
Gregor 1
never 1
responded 1
to 1
being 1
spoken 1
to 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
but 1
just 1
remained 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
without 1
moving 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
door 1
had 1
never 1
even 1
been 1
opened 1
If 1
only 1
they 1
had 1
told 1
this 1
charwoman 1
to 1
clean 1
up 1
his 1
room 1
every 1
day 1
instead 1
of 1
letting 1
her 1
disturb 1
him 1
for 1
no 1
reason 1
whenever 1
she 1
felt 1
like 1
it 1
One 1
day 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
while 1
a 1
heavy 1
rain 1
struck 1
the 1
windowpanes 1
perhaps 1
indicating 1
that 1
spring 1
was 1
coming 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
once 1
again 1
Gregor 1
was 1
so 1
resentful 1
of 1
it 1
that 1
he 1
started 1
to 1
move 1
toward 1
her 1
he 1
was 1
slow 1
and 1
infirm 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
like 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
attack 1
Instead 1
of 1
being 1
afraid 1
the 1
charwoman 1
just 1
lifted 1
up 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
chairs 1
from 1
near 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
stood 1
there 1
with 1
her 1
mouth 1
open 1
clearly 1
intending 1
not 1
to 1
close 1
her 1
mouth 1
until 1
the 1
chair 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
had 1
been 1
slammed 1
down 1
into 1
Gregor 1
s 1
back 1
Aren 1
t 1
you 1
coming 1
any 1
closer 1
then 1
she 1
asked 1
when 1
Gregor 1
turned 1
round 1
again 1
and 1
she 1
calmly 1
put 1
the 1
chair 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
Gregor 1
had 1
almost 1
entirely 1
stopped 1
eating 1
Only 1
if 1
he 1
happened 1
to 1
find 1
himself 1
next 1
to 1
the 1
food 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
prepared 1
for 1
him 1
he 1
might 1
take 1
some 1
of 1
it 1
into 1
his 1
mouth 1
to 1
play 1
with 1
it 1
leave 1
it 1
there 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
and 1
then 1
more 1
often 1
than 1
not 1
spit 1
it 1
out 1
again 1
At 1
first 1
he 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
distress 1
at 1
the 1
state 1
of 1
his 1
room 1
that 1
stopped 1
him 1
eating 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
soon 1
got 1
used 1
to 1
the 1
changes 1
made 1
there 1
They 1
had 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
putting 1
things 1
into 1
this 1
room 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
room 1
for 1
anywhere 1
else 1
and 1
there 1
were 1
now 1
many 1
such 1
things 1
as 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
rooms 1
in 1
the 1
flat 1
had 1
been 1
rented 1
out 1
to 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
These 1
earnest 1
gentlemen 1
all 1
three 1
of 1
them 1
had 1
full 1
beards 1
as 1
Gregor 1
learned 1
peering 1
through 1
the 1
crack 1
in 1
the 1
door 1
one 1
day 1
were 1
painfully 1
insistent 1
on 1
things 1
being 1
tidy 1
This 1
meant 1
not 1
only 1
in 1
their 1
own 1
room 1
but 1
since 1
they 1
had 1
taken 1
a 1
room 1
in 1
this 1
establishment 1
in 1
the 1
entire 1
flat 1
and 1
especially 1
in 1
the 1
kitchen 1
Unnecessary 1
clutter 1
was 1
something 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
tolerate 1
especially 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
dirty 1
They 1
had 1
moreover 1
brought 1
most 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
furnishings 1
and 1
equipment 1
with 1
them 1
For 1
this 1
reason 1
many 1
things 1
had 1
become 1
superfluous 1
which 1
although 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
sold 1
the 1
family 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
discard 1
All 1
these 1
things 1
found 1
their 1
way 1
into 1
Gregor 1
s 1
room 1
The 1
dustbins 1
from 1
the 1
kitchen 1
found 1
their 1
way 1
in 1
there 1
too 1
The 1
charwoman 1
was 1
always 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
and 1
anything 1
she 1
couldn 1
t 1
use 1
for 1
the 1
time 1
being 1
she 1
would 1
just 1
chuck 1
in 1
there 1
He 1
fortunately 1
would 1
usually 1
see 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
the 1
object 1
and 1
the 1
hand 1
that 1
held 1
it 1
The 1
woman 1
most 1
likely 1
meant 1
to 1
fetch 1
the 1
things 1
back 1
out 1
again 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
time 1
and 1
the 1
opportunity 1
or 1
to 1
throw 1
everything 1
out 1
in 1
one 1
go 1
but 1
what 1
actually 1
happened 1
was 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
left 1
where 1
they 1
landed 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
first 1
been 1
thrown 1
unless 1
Gregor 1
made 1
his 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
junk 1
and 1
moved 1
it 1
somewhere 1
else 1
At 1
first 1
he 1
moved 1
it 1
because 1
with 1
no 1
other 1
room 1
free 1
where 1
he 1
could 1
crawl 1
about 1
he 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
but 1
later 1
on 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
enjoy 1
it 1
although 1
moving 1
about 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
left 1
him 1
sad 1
and 1
tired 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
remain 1
immobile 1
for 1
hours 1
afterwards 1
The 1
gentlemen 1
who 1
rented 1
the 1
room 1
would 1
sometimes 1
take 1
their 1
evening 1
meal 1
at 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
that 1
was 1
used 1
by 1
everyone 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
this 1
room 1
was 1
often 1
kept 1
closed 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
But 1
Gregor 1
found 1
it 1
easy 1
to 1
give 1
up 1
having 1
the 1
door 1
open 1
he 1
had 1
after 1
all 1
often 1
failed 1
to 1
make 1
use 1
of 1
it 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
open 1
and 1
without 1
the 1
family 1
having 1
noticed 1
it 1
lain 1
in 1
his 1
room 1
in 1
its 1
darkest 1
corner 1
One 1
time 1
though 1
the 1
charwoman 1
left 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
slightly 1
open 1
and 1
it 1
remained 1
open 1
when 1
the 1
gentlemen 1
who 1
rented 1
the 1
room 1
came 1
in 2
the 1
evening 1
and 1
the 1
light 1
was 1
put 1
on 1
They 1
sat 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
where 1
formerly 1
Gregor 1
had 1
taken 1
his 1
meals 1
with 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
they 1
unfolded 1
the 1
serviettes 1
and 1
picked 1
up 1
their 1
knives 1
and 1
forks 1
Gregor 1
s 1
mother 1
immediately 1
appeared 1
in 1
the 1
doorway 1
with 1
a 1
dish 1
of 1
meat 1
and 1
soon 1
behind 1
her 1
came 1
his 1
sister 1
with 1
a 1
dish 1
piled 1
high 1
with 1
potatoes 1
The 1
food 1
was 1
steaming 1
and 1
filled 1
the 1
room 1
with 1
its 1
smell 1
The 1
gentlemen 1
bent 1
over 1
the 1
dishes 1
set 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
them 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
wanted 1
to 1
test 1
the 1
food 1
before 1
eating 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
gentleman 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
who 1
seemed 1
to 1
count 1
as 1
an 1
authority 1
for 1
the 1
other 1
two 1
did 1
indeed 1
cut 1
off 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
meat 1
while 1
it 1
was 1
still 1
in 1
its 1
dish 1
clearly 1
wishing 1
to 1
establish 1
whether 1
it 1
was 1
sufficiently 1
cooked 1
or 1
whether 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
sent 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
kitchen 1
It 1
was 1
to 1
his 1
satisfaction 1
and 1
Gregor 1
s 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
looking 1
on 1
anxiously 1
began 1
to 1
breathe 1
again 1
and 1
smiled 1
The 1
family 1
themselves 1
ate 1
in 1
the 1
kitchen 1
Nonetheless 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
before 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
bowed 1
once 1
with 1
his 1
cap 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
did 1
his 1
round 1
of 1
the 1
table 1
The 1
gentlemen 1
stood 1
as 1
one 1
and 1
mumbled 1
something 1
into 1
their 1
beards 1
Then 1
once 1
they 1
were 1
alone 1
they 1
ate 1
in 1
near 1
perfect 1
silence 1
It 1
seemed 1
remarkable 1
to 1
Gregor 1
that 1
above 1
all 1
the 1
various 1
noises 1
of 1
eating 1
their 1
chewing 1
teeth 1
could 1
still 1
be 1
heard 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
wanted 1
to 1
show 1
Gregor 1
that 1
you 1
need 1
teeth 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
possible 1
to 1
perform 1
anything 1
with 1
jaws 1
that 1
are 1
toothless 1
however 1
nice 1
they 1
might 1
be 1
I 1
d 1
like 1
to 1
eat 1
something 1
said 1
Gregor 1
anxiously 1
but 1
not 1
anything 1
like 1
they 1
re 1
eating 1
They 1
do 1
feed 1
themselves 1
And 1
here 1
I 1
am 1
dying 1
Throughout 1
all 1
this 1
time 1
Gregor 1
could 1
not 1
remember 1
having 1
heard 1
the 1
violin 1
being 1
played 1
but 1
this 1
evening 1
it 1
began 1
to 1
be 1
heard 1
from 1
the 1
kitchen 1
The 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
had 1
already 1
finished 1
their 1
meal 1
the 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
had 1
produced 1
a 1
newspaper 1
given 1
a 1
page 1
to 1
each 1
of 1
the 1
others 1
and 1
now 1
they 1
leant 1
back 1
in 1
their 1
chairs 1
reading 1
them 1
and 1
smoking 1
When 1
the 1
violin 1
began 1
playing 1
they 1
became 1
attentive 1
stood 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
tip 1
toe 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
hallway 1
where 1
they 1
stood 1
pressed 1
against 1
each 1
other 1
Someone 1
must 1
have 1
heard 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
kitchen 1
as 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
called 1
out 1
Is 1
the 1
playing 1
perhaps 1
unpleasant 1
for 1
the 1
gentlemen 1
We 1
can 1
stop 1
it 1
straight 1
away 1
On 1
the 1
contrary 1
said 1
the 1
middle 1
gentleman 1
would 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
not 1
like 1
to 1
come 1
in 1
and 1
play 1
for 1
us 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
it 1
is 1
after 1
all 1
much 1
more 1
cosy 1
and 1
comfortable 1
Oh 1
yes 1
we 1
d 1
love 1
to 1
called 1
back 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
violin 1
player 1
himself 1
The 1
gentlemen 1
stepped 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
waited 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
soon 1
appeared 1
with 1
the 1
music 1
stand 1
his 1
mother 1
with 1
the 1
music 1
and 1
his 1
sister 1
with 1
the 1
violin 1
She 1
calmly 1
prepared 1
everything 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
begin 1
playing 1
his 1
parents 1
who 1
had 1
never 1
rented 1
a 1
room 1
out 1
before 1
and 1
therefore 1
showed 1
an 1
exaggerated 1
courtesy 1
towards 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
did 1
not 1
even 1
dare 1
to 1
sit 1
on 1
their 1
own 1
chairs 1
his 1
father 1
leant 1
against 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
his 1
right 1
hand 1
pushed 1
in 1
between 1
two 1
buttons 1
on 1
his 1
uniform 1
coat 1
his 1
mother 1
though 1
was 1
offered 1
a 1
seat 1
by 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
gentlemen 1
and 1
sat 1
leaving 1
the 1
chair 1
where 1
the 1
gentleman 1
happened 1
to 1
have 1
placed 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
in 1
a 1
corner 1
His 1
sister 1
began 1
to 1
play 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
paid 1
close 1
attention 1
one 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
to 1
the 1
movements 1
of 1
her 1
hands 1
Drawn 1
in 1
by 1
the 1
playing 1
Gregor 1
had 1
dared 1
to 1
come 1
forward 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
already 1
had 1
his 1
head 1
in 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
Before 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
great 1
pride 1
in 1
how 1
considerate 1
he 1
was 1
but 1
now 1
it 1
hardly 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
become 1
so 1
thoughtless 1
about 1
the 1
others 1
What 1
s 1
more 1
there 1
was 1
now 1
all 1
the 1
more 1
reason 1
to 1
keep 1
himself 1
hidden 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
covered 1
in 1
the 1
dust 1
that 1
lay 1
everywhere 1
in 1
his 1
room 1
and 1
flew 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
slightest 1
movement 1
he 1
carried 1
threads 1
hairs 1
and 1
remains 1
of 1
food 1
about 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
and 1
sides 1
he 1
was 1
much 1
too 1
indifferent 1
to 1
everything 1
now 1
to 1
lay 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
and 1
wipe 1
himself 1
on 1
the 1
carpet 1
like 1
he 1
had 1
used 1
to 1
do 1
several 1
times 1
a 1
day 1
And 1
despite 1
this 1
condition 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
too 1
shy 1
to 1
move 1
forward 1
a 1
little 1
onto 1
the 1
immaculate 1
floor 1
of 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
No 1
one 1
noticed 1
him 1
though 1
The 1
family 1
was 1
totally 1
preoccupied 1
with 1
the 1
violin 1
playing 1
at 1
first 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
had 1
put 1
their 1
hands 1
in 1
their 1
pockets 1
and 1
come 1
up 1
far 1
too 1
close 1
behind 1
the 1
music 1
stand 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
all 1
the 1
notes 1
being 1
played 1
and 1
they 1
must 1
have 1
disturbed 1
Gregor 1
s 1
sister 1
but 1
soon 1
in 1
contrast 1
with 1
the 1
family 1
they 1
withdrew 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
with 1
their 1
heads 1
sunk 1
and 1
talking 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
at 1
half 1
volume 1
and 1
they 1
stayed 1
by 1
the 1
window 1
while 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
observed 1
them 1
anxiously 1
It 1
really 1
now 1
seemed 1
very 1
obvious 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
expected 1
to 1
hear 1
some 1
beautiful 1
or 1
entertaining 1
violin 1
playing 1
but 1
had 1
been 1
disappointed 1
that 1
they 1
had 2
enough 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
performance 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
now 1
out 1
of 1
politeness 1
that 1
they 1
allowed 1
their 1
peace 1
to 1
be 1
disturbed 1
It 1
was 1
especially 1
unnerving 1
the 1
way 1
they 1
all 1
blew 1
the 1
smoke 1
from 1
their 1
cigarettes 1
upwards 1
from 1
their 1
mouth 1
and 1
noses 1
Yet 1
Gregor 1
s 1
sister 1
was 1
playing 1
so 1
beautifully 1
Her 1
face 1
was 1
leant 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
following 1
the 1
lines 1
of 1
music 1
with 1
a 1
careful 1
and 1
melancholy 1
expression 1
Gregor 1
crawled 1
a 1
little 1
further 1
forward 1
keeping 1
his 1
head 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
meet 1
her 1
eyes 1
if 1
the 1
chance 1
came 1
Was 1
he 1
an 1
animal 1
if 1
music 1
could 1
captivate 1
him 1
so 1
It 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
being 1
shown 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
unknown 1
nourishment 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
yearning 1
for 1
He 1
was 1
determined 1
to 1
make 1
his 1
way 1
forward 1
to 1
his 1
sister 1
and 1
tug 1
at 1
her 1
skirt 1
to 1
show 1
her 1
she 1
might 1
come 1
into 1
his 1
room 1
with 1
her 1
violin 1
as 1
no 1
one 1
appreciated 1
her 1
playing 1
here 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
he 1
would 1
He 1
never 1
wanted 1
to 1
let 1
her 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
room 1
not 1
while 1
he 1
lived 1
anyway 1
his 1
shocking 1
appearance 1
should 1
for 1
once 1
be 1
of 1
some 1
use 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
every 1
door 1
of 1
his 1
room 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
hiss 1
and 1
spit 1
at 1
the 1
attackers 1
his 1
sister 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
forced 1
to 1
stay 1
with 1
him 1
though 1
but 1
stay 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
free 1
will 1
she 1
would 1
sit 1
beside 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
couch 1
with 1
her 1
ear 1
bent 1
down 1
to 1
him 1
while 1
he 1
told 1
her 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
always 1
intended 1
to 1
send 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
conservatory 1
how 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
told 1
everyone 1
about 1
it 1
last 1
Christmas 1
had 1
Christmas 1
really 1
come 1
and 1
gone 1
already 1
if 1
this 1
misfortune 1
hadn 1
t 1
got 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
and 1
refuse 1
to 1
let 1
anyone 1
dissuade 1
him 1
from 1
it 1
On 1
hearing 1
all 1
this 1
his 1
sister 1
would 1
break 1
out 1
in 1
tears 1
of 1
emotion 1
and 1
Gregor 1
would 1
climb 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
shoulder 1
and 1
kiss 1
her 1
neck 1
which 1
since 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
going 1
out 1
to 1
work 1
she 1
had 1
kept 1
free 1
without 1
any 1
necklace 1
or 1
collar 1
Mr 1
Samsa 1
shouted 1
the 1
middle 1
gentleman 1
to 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
pointing 1
without 1
wasting 1
any 1
more 1
words 1
with 1
his 1
forefinger 1
at 1
Gregor 1
as 1
he 1
slowly 1
moved 1
forward 1
The 1
violin 1
went 1
silent 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
first 1
smiled 1
at 1
his 1
two 1
friends 1
shaking 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
then 1
looked 1
back 1
at 1
Gregor 1
His 1
father 1
seemed 1
to 1
think 1
it 1
more 1
important 1
to 1
calm 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
before 1
driving 1
Gregor 1
out 1
even 1
though 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
upset 1
and 1
seemed 1
to 1
think 1
Gregor 1
was 1
more 1
entertaining 1
than 1
the 1
violin 1
playing 1
had 1
been 1
He 1
rushed 1
up 1
to 1
them 1
with 1
his 1
arms 1
spread 1
out 1
and 1
attempted 1
to 1
drive 1
them 1
back 1
into 1
their 1
room 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
as 1
trying 1
to 1
block 1
their 1
view 1
of 1
Gregor 1
with 1
his 1
body 1
Now 1
they 1
did 1
become 1
a 1
little 1
annoyed 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
clear 1
whether 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
father 1
s 1
behaviour 1
that 1
annoyed 1
them 1
or 1
the 1
dawning 1
realisation 1
that 1
they 1
had 2
a 1
neighbour 1
like 1
Gregor 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
without 1
knowing 1
it 1
They 1
asked 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
for 1
explanations 1
raised 1
their 1
arms 1
like 1
he 1
had 1
tugged 1
excitedly 1
at 1
their 1
beards 1
and 1
moved 1
back 1
towards 1
their 1
room 1
only 1
very 1
slowly 1
Meanwhile 1
Gregor 1
s 1
sister 1
had 1
overcome 1
the 1
despair 1
she 1
had 1
fallen 1
into 1
when 1
her 1
playing 1
was 1
suddenly 1
interrupted 1
She 1
had 1
let 1
her 1
hands 1
drop 1
and 1
let 1
violin 1
and 1
bow 1
hang 1
limply 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
but 1
continued 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
music 1
as 1
if 1
still 1
playing 1
but 1
then 1
she 1
suddenly 1
pulled 1
herself 1
together 1
lay 1
the 1
instrument 1
on 1
her 1
mother 1
s 1
lap 1
who 1
still 1
sat 1
laboriously 1
struggling 1
for 1
breath 1
where 1
she 1
was 1
and 1
ran 1
into 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
which 1
under 1
pressure 1
from 1
her 1
father 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
were 1
more 1
quickly 1
moving 1
toward 1
Under 1
his 1
sister 1
s 1
experienced 1
hand 1
the 1
pillows 1
and 1
covers 1
on 1
the 1
beds 1
flew 1
up 1
and 1
were 1
put 1
into 1
order 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
already 1
finished 1
making 1
the 1
beds 1
and 1
slipped 1
out 1
again 1
before 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
room 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
seemed 1
so 1
obsessed 1
with 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
doing 1
that 1
he 1
forgot 1
all 1
the 1
respect 1
he 1
owed 1
to 1
his 1
tenants 1
He 1
urged 1
them 1
and 1
pressed 1
them 1
until 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
already 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
shouted 1
like 1
thunder 1
and 1
stamped 1
his 1
foot 1
and 1
thereby 1
brought 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
to 1
a 1
halt 1
I 1
declare 1
here 1
and 1
now 1
he 1
said 1
raising 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
glancing 1
at 1
Gregor 1
s 1
mother 1
and 1
sister 1
to 1
gain 1
their 1
attention 1
too 1
that 1
with 1
regard 1
to 1
the 1
repugnant 1
conditions 1
that 1
prevail 1
in 1
this 1
flat 1
and 1
with 1
this 1
family 1
here 1
he 1
looked 1
briefly 1
but 1
decisively 1
at 1
the 1
floor 1
I 1
give 1
immediate 1
notice 1
on 1
my 1
room 1
For 1
the 1
days 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
living 1
here 1
I 1
will 1
of 1
course 1
pay 1
nothing 1
at 1
all 1
on 1
the 1
contrary 1
I 1
will 1
consider 1
whether 1
to 1
proceed 1
with 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
action 1
for 1
damages 1
from 1
you 1
and 1
believe 1
me 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
very 1
easy 1
to 1
set 1
out 1
the 1
grounds 1
for 1
such 1
an 1
action 1
He 1
was 1
silent 1
and 1
looked 1
straight 1
ahead 1
as 1
if 1
waiting 1
for 1
something 1
And 1
indeed 1
his 1
two 1
friends 1
joined 1
in 1
with 1
the 1
words 1
And 1
we 1
also 1
give 1
immediate 1
notice 1
With 1
that 1
he 1
took 1
hold 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
handle 1
and 1
slammed 1
the 1
door 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
staggered 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
seat 1
feeling 1
his 1
way 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
fell 1
into 1
it 2
looked 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
stretching 1
himself 1
out 1
for 1
his 1
usual 1
evening 1
nap 1
but 1
from 1
the 1
uncontrolled 1
way 1
his 1
head 1
kept 1
nodding 1
it 1
could 1
be 1
seen 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
sleeping 1
at 1
all 1
Throughout 1
all 1
this 1
Gregor 1
had 1
lain 1
still 1
where 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
had 1
first 1
seen 1
him 1
His 1
disappointment 1
at 1
the 1
failure 1
of 1
his 1
plan 1
and 1
perhaps 1
also 1
because 1
he 1
was 1
weak 1
from 1
hunger 1
made 1
it 1
impossible 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
move 1
He 1
was 1
sure 1
that 1
everyone 1
would 1
turn 1
on 1
him 1
any 1
moment 1
and 1
he 1
waited 1
He 1
was 1
not 1
even 1
startled 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
state 1
when 1
the 1
violin 1
on 1
his 1
mother 1
s 1
lap 1
fell 1
from 1
her 1
trembling 1
fingers 1
and 1
landed 1
loudly 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
Father 1
Mother 1
said 1
his 1
sister 1
hitting 1
the 1
table 1
with 1
her 1
hand 1
as 1
introduction 1
we 1
can 1
t 1
carry 1
on 1
like 1
this 1
Maybe 1
you 1
can 1
t 1
see 1
it 1
but 1
I 1
can 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
call 1
this 1
monster 1
my 1
brother 1
all 1
I 1
can 1
say 1
is 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
it 1
We 1
ve 1
done 1
all 1
that 1
s 1
humanly 1
possible 1
to 1
look 1
after 1
it 1
and 1
be 1
patient 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
anyone 1
could 1
accuse 1
us 1
of 1
doing 1
anything 1
wrong 1
She 1
s 1
absolutely 1
right 1
said 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
to 1
himself 1
His 1
mother 1
who 1
still 1
had 1
not 1
had 1
time 1
to 1
catch 1
her 1
breath 1
began 1
to 1
cough 1
dully 1
her 1
hand 1
held 1
out 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
her 1
and 1
a 1
deranged 1
expression 1
in 1
her 1
eyes 1
Gregor 1
s 1
sister 1
rushed 1
to 1
his 1
mother 1
and 1
put 1
her 1
hand 1
on 1
her 1
forehead 1
Her 1
words 1
seemed 1
to 1
give 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
some 1
more 1
definite 1
ideas 1
He 1
sat 1
upright 1
played 1
with 1
his 1
uniform 1
cap 1
between 1
the 1
plates 1
left 1
by 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
after 1
their 1
meal 1
and 1
occasionally 1
looked 1
down 1
at 1
Gregor 1
as 1
he 1
lay 1
there 1
immobile 1
We 1
have 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
it 1
said 1
Gregor 1
s 1
sister 1
now 1
speaking 1
only 1
to 1
her 1
father 1
as 1
her 1
mother 1
was 1
too 1
occupied 1
with 1
coughing 1
to 1
listen 1
it 1
ll 1
be 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
both 1
of 1
you 1
I 1
can 1
see 1
it 1
coming 1
We 1
can 1
t 1
all 1
work 1
as 1
hard 1
as 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
and 1
then 1
come 1
home 1
to 1
be 1
tortured 1
like 1
this 1
we 1
can 1
t 1
endure 1
it 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
endure 1
it 1
any 1
more 1
And 1
she 1
broke 1
out 1
so 1
heavily 1
in 1
tears 1
that 1
they 1
flowed 1
down 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
her 1
mother 1
and 1
she 1
wiped 1
them 1
away 1
with 1
mechanical 1
hand 1
movements 1
My 1
child 1
said 1
her 1
father 1
with 1
sympathy 1
and 1
obvious 1
understanding 1
what 1
are 1
we 1
to 1
do 1
His 1
sister 1
just 1
shrugged 1
her 1
shoulders 1
as 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
the 1
helplessness 1
and 1
tears 1
that 1
had 1
taken 1
hold 1
of 1
her 1
displacing 1
her 1
earlier 1
certainty 1
If 1
he 1
could 1
just 1
understand 1
us 1
said 1
his 1
father 1
almost 1
as 1
a 1
question 1
his 1
sister 1
shook 1
her 1
hand 1
vigorously 1
through 1
her 1
tears 1
as 1
a 1
sign 1
that 1
of 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
question 1
If 1
he 1
could 1
just 1
understand 1
us 1
repeated 1
Gregor 1
s 1
father 1
closing 1
his 1
eyes 1
in 1
acceptance 1
of 1
his 1
sister 1
s 1
certainty 1
that 2
was 1
quite 1
impossible 1
then 1
perhaps 1
we 1
could 1
come 1
to 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
arrangement 1
with 1
him 1
But 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
It 1
s 1
got 1
to 1
go 1
shouted 1
his 1
sister 1
that 1
s 1
the 1
only 1
way 1
Father 1
You 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
the 1
idea 1
that 2
s 1
Gregor 1
We 1
ve 1
only 1
harmed 1
ourselves 1
by 1
believing 1
it 1
for 1
so 1
long 1
How 1
can 1
that 1
be 1
Gregor 1
If 1
it 1
were 1
Gregor 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
seen 1
long 1
ago 1
that 1
it 1
s 1
not 1
possible 1
for 1
human 1
beings 1
to 1
live 1
with 1
an 1
animal 1
like 1
that 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
gone 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
free 1
will 1
We 1
wouldn 1
t 1
have 1
a 1
brother 1
any 1
more 1
then 1
but 1
we 1
could 1
carry 1
on 1
with 1
our 1
lives 1
and 1
remember 1
him 1
with 1
respect 1
As 1
it 1
is 1
this 1
animal 1
is 1
persecuting 1
us 1
it 1
s 1
driven 1
out 1
our 1
tenants 1
it 1
obviously 1
wants 1
to 1
take 1
over 1
the 1
whole 1
flat 1
and 1
force 1
us 1
to 1
sleep 1
on 1
the 1
streets 1
Father 1
look 1
just 1
look 1
she 1
suddenly 1
screamed 1
he 1
s 1
starting 1
again 1
In 1
her 1
alarm 1
which 1
was 1
totally 1
beyond 1
Gregor 1
s 1
comprehension 1
his 1
sister 1
even 1
abandoned 1
his 1
mother 1
as 1
she 1
pushed 1
herself 1
vigorously 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
chair 1
as 1
if 1
more 1
willing 1
to 1
sacrifice 1
her 1
own 1
mother 1
than 1
stay 1
anywhere 1
near 1
Gregor 1
She 1
rushed 1
over 1
to 1
behind 1
her 1
father 1
who 1
had 1
become 1
excited 1
merely 1
because 1
she 1
was 1
and 1
stood 1
up 1
half 1
raising 1
his 1
hands 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
Gregor 1
s 1
sister 1
as 1
if 1
to 1
protect 1
her 1
But 1
Gregor 1
had 2
no 1
intention 1
of 1
frightening 1
anyone 1
least 1
of 1
all 1
his 1
sister 1
All 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
was 1
begin 1
to 1
turn 1
round 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
go 1
back 1
into 1
his 1
room 1
although 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
itself 1
quite 1
startling 1
as 1
his 1
pain 1
wracked 1
condition 1
meant 1
that 1
turning 1
round 1
required 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
effort 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
using 1
his 1
head 1
to 1
help 1
himself 1
do 1
it 1
repeatedly 1
raising 1
it 1
and 1
striking 1
it 1
against 1
the 1
floor 1
He 1
stopped 1
and 1
looked 1
round 1
They 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
realised 1
his 1
good 1
intention 1
and 1
had 1
only 1
been 1
alarmed 1
briefly 1
Now 1
they 1
all 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
in 1
unhappy 1
silence 1
His 1
mother 1
lay 1
in 1
her 1
chair 1
with 1
her 1
legs 1
stretched 1
out 1
and 1
pressed 1
against 1
each 1
other 1
her 1
eyes 1
nearly 1
closed 1
with 1
exhaustion 1
his 1
sister 1
sat 1
next 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
with 1
her 1
arms 1
around 1
his 1
neck 1
Maybe 1
now 1
they 1
ll 1
let 1
me 1
turn 1
round 1
thought 1
Gregor 1
and 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
work 1
He 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
panting 1
loudly 1
with 1
the 1
effort 1
and 1
had 1
sometimes 1
to 1
stop 1
and 1
take 1
a 1
rest 1
No 1
one 1
was 1
making 1
him 1
rush 1
any 1
more 1
everything 1
was 1
left 1
up 1
to 1
him 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
finally 1
finished 1
turning 1
round 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
move 1
straight 1
ahead 1
He 1
was 1
amazed 1
at 1
the 1
great 1
distance 1
that 1
separated 1
him 1
from 1
his 1
room 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
understand 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
covered 1
that 1
distance 1
in 1
his 1
weak 1
state 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
before 1
and 1
almost 1
without 1
noticing 1
it 1
He 1
concentrated 1
on 1
crawling 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
and 1
hardly 1
noticed 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
word 1
not 1
any 1
cry 1
from 1
his 1
family 1
to 1
distract 1
him 1
He 1
did 1
not 1
turn 1
his 1
head 1
until 1
he 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
doorway 1
He 1
did 1
not 1
turn 1
it 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
round 1
as 1
he 1
felt 1
his 1
neck 1
becoming 1
stiff 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
nonetheless 1
enough 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
nothing 1
behind 1
him 1
had 1
changed 1
only 1
his 1
sister 1
had 1
stood 1
up 1
With 1
his 1
last 1
glance 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
his 1
mother 1
had 1
now 1
fallen 1
completely 1
asleep 1
He 1
was 1
hardly 1
inside 1
his 1
room 1
before 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
hurriedly 1
shut 1
bolted 1
and 1
locked 1
The 1
sudden 1
noise 1
behind 1
Gregor 1
so 1
startled 1
him 1
that 1
his 1
little 1
legs 1
collapsed 1
under 1
him 1
It 1
was 1
his 1
sister 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
so 1
much 1
of 1
a 1
rush 1
She 1
had 1
been 1
standing 1
there 1
waiting 1
and 1
sprung 1
forward 1
lightly 1
Gregor 1
had 1
not 1
heard 1
her 1
coming 1
at 1
all 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
turned 1
the 1
key 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
she 1
said 1
loudly 1
to 1
her 1
parents 1
At 1
last 1
What 1
now 1
then 1
Gregor 1
asked 1
himself 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
round 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
He 1
soon 1
made 1
the 1
discovery 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
move 1
at 1
all 1
This 1
was 1
no 1
surprise 1
to 1
him 1
it 1
seemed 1
rather 1
that 1
being 1
able 1
to 1
actually 1
move 1
around 1
on 1
those 1
spindly 1
little 1
legs 1
until 1
then 1
was 1
unnatural 1
He 1
also 1
felt 1
relatively 1
comfortable 1
It 1
is 1
true 1
that 1
his 1
entire 1
body 1
was 1
aching 1
but 1
the 1
pain 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
slowly 1
getting 1
weaker 1
and 1
weaker 1
and 1
would 1
finally 1
disappear 1
altogether 1
He 1
could 1
already 1
hardly 1
feel 1
the 1
decayed 1
apple 1
in 1
his 1
back 1
or 1
the 1
inflamed 1
area 1
around 1
it 1
which 1
was 1
entirely 1
covered 1
in 1
white 1
dust 1
He 1
thought 1
back 1
of 1
his 1
family 1
with 1
emotion 1
and 1
love 1
If 1
it 1
was 1
possible 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
must 1
go 1
away 1
even 1
more 1
strongly 1
than 1
his 1
sister 1
He 1
remained 1
in 1
this 1
state 1
of 1
empty 1
and 1
peaceful 1
rumination 1
until 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
clock 1
tower 1
strike 1
three 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
He 1
watched 1
as 1
it 1
slowly 1
began 1
to 1
get 1
light 1
everywhere 1
outside 1
the 1
window 1
too 1
Then 1
without 1
his 1
willing 1
it 1
his 1
head 1
sank 1
down 1
completely 1
and 1
his 1
last 1
breath 1
flowed 1
weakly 1
from 1
his 1
nostrils 1
When 1
the 1
cleaner 1
came 1
in 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
they 1
d 1
often 1
asked 1
her 1
not 1
to 1
keep 1
slamming 1
the 1
doors 1
but 1
with 1
her 1
strength 1
and 1
in 1
her 1
hurry 1
she 1
still 1
did 1
so 1
that 1
everyone 1
in 1
the 1
flat 1
knew 1
when 1
she 1
d 1
arrived 1
and 1
from 1
then 1
on 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
to 1
sleep 1
in 1
peace 1
she 1
made 1
her 1
usual 1
brief 1
look 1
in 1
on 1
Gregor 1
and 1
at 1
first 1
found 1
nothing 1
special 1
She 1
thought 1
he 1
was 1
laying 1
there 1
so 1
still 1
on 1
purpose 1
playing 1
the 1
martyr 1
she 1
attributed 1
all 1
possible 1
understanding 1
to 1
him 1
She 1
happened 1
to 1
be 1
holding 1
the 1
long 1
broom 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
so 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
tickle 1
Gregor 1
with 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
doorway 1
When 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
success 1
with 1
that 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
nuisance 1
of 1
herself 1
and 1
poked 1
at 1
him 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
only 1
when 1
she 1
found 1
she 1
could 1
shove 1
him 1
across 1
the 1
floor 1
with 1
no 1
resistance 1
at 1
all 1
did 1
she 1
start 1
to 1
pay 1
attention 1
She 1
soon 1
realised 1
what 1
had 1
really 1
happened 1
opened 1
her 1
eyes 1
wide 1
whistled 1
to 1
herself 1
but 1
did 1
not 1
waste 1
time 1
to 1
yank 1
open 1
the 1
bedroom 1
doors 1
and 1
shout 1
loudly 1
into 1
the 1
darkness 1
of 1
the 1
bedrooms 1
Come 1
and 1
ave 1
a 1
look 1
at 1
this 1
it 1
s 1
dead 1
just 1
lying 1
there 1
stone 1
dead 1
Mr 1
and 1
Mrs 1
Samsa 1
sat 1
upright 1
there 1
in 1
their 1
marriage 1
bed 1
and 1
had 1
to 1
make 1
an 1
effort 1
to 1
get 1
over 1
the 1
shock 1
caused 1
by 1
the 1
cleaner 1
before 1
they 1
could 1
grasp 1
what 1
she 1
was 1
saying 1
But 1
then 1
each 1
from 1
his 1
own 1
side 1
they 1
hurried 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
Mr 1
Samsa 1
threw 1
the 1
blanket 1
over 1
his 1
shoulders 1
Mrs 1
Samsa 1
just 1
came 1
out 1
in 1
her 1
nightdress 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
how 1
they 1
went 1
into 1
Gregor 1
s 1
room 1
On 1
the 1
way 1
they 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
the 1
living 1
room 1
where 1
Grete 1
had 1
been 1
sleeping 1
since 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
had 1
moved 1
in 1
she 1
was 1
fully 1
dressed 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
never 1
been 1
asleep 1
and 1
the 1
paleness 1
of 1
her 1
face 1
seemed 1
to 1
confirm 1
this 1
Dead 1
asked 1
Mrs 1
Samsa 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
charwoman 1
enquiringly 1
even 1
though 1
she 1
could 1
have 1
checked 1
for 1
herself 1
and 1
could 1
have 1
known 1
it 1
even 1
without 1
checking 1
That 1
s 1
what 1
I 1
said 1
replied 1
the 1
cleaner 1
and 1
to 1
prove 1
it 1
she 1
gave 1
Gregor 1
s 1
body 1
another 1
shove 1
with 1
the 1
broom 1
sending 1
it 1
sideways 1
across 1
the 1
floor 1
Mrs 1
Samsa 1
made 1
a 1
movement 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
wanted 1
to 1
hold 1
back 1
the 1
broom 1
but 1
did 1
not 1
complete 1
it 1
Now 1
then 1
said 1
Mr 1
Samsa 1
let 1
s 1
give 1
thanks 1
to 1
God 1
for 1
that 1
He 1
crossed 1
himself 1
and 1
the 1
three 1
women 1
followed 1
his 1
example 1
Grete 1
who 1
had 1
not 1
taken 1
her 1
eyes 1
from 1
the 1
corpse 1
said 1
Just 1
look 1
how 1
thin 1
he 1
was 1
He 1
didn 1
t 1
eat 1
anything 1
for 1
so 1
long 1
The 1
food 1
came 1
out 1
again 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
when 1
it 1
went 1
in 1
Gregor 1
s 1
body 1
was 1
indeed 1
completely 1
dried 1
up 1
and 1
flat 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
seen 1
it 1
until 1
then 1
but 1
now 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
lifted 1
up 1
on 1
his 1
little 1
legs 1
nor 1
did 1
he 1
do 1
anything 1
to 1
make 1
them 1
look 1
away 1
Grete 1
come 1
with 1
us 1
in 1
here 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
said 1
Mrs 1
Samsa 1
with 1
a 1
pained 1
smile 1
and 1
Grete 1
followed 1
her 1
parents 1
into 1
the 1
bedroom 1
but 1
not 1
without 1
looking 1
back 1
at 1
the 1
body 1
The 1
cleaner 1
shut 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
window 1
wide 1
Although 1
it 1
was 1
still 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
the 1
fresh 1
air 1
had 1
something 1
of 1
warmth 1
mixed 1
in 1
with 1
it 1
It 1
was 1
already 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
March 1
after 1
all 1
The 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
stepped 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
room 1
and 1
looked 1
round 1
in 1
amazement 1
for 1
their 1
breakfasts 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
forgotten 1
about 1
Where 1
is 1
our 1
breakfast 1
the 1
middle 1
gentleman 1
asked 1
the 1
cleaner 1
irritably 1
She 1
just 1
put 1
her 1
finger 1
on 1
her 1
lips 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
quick 1
and 1
silent 1
sign 1
to 1
the 1
men 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
like 1
to 1
come 1
into 1
Gregor 1
s 1
room 1
They 1
did 1
so 1
and 1
stood 1
around 1
Gregor 1
s 1
corpse 1
with 1
their 1
hands 1
in 1
the 1
pockets 1
of 1
their 1
well 1
worn 1
coats 1
It 1
was 1
now 1
quite 1
light 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
Then 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
bedroom 1
opened 1
and 1
Mr 1
Samsa 1
appeared 1
in 1
his 1
uniform 1
with 1
his 1
wife 1
on 1
one 1
arm 1
and 1
his 1
daughter 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
All 1
of 1
them 1
had 1
been 1
crying 1
a 1
little 1
Grete 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
pressed 1
her 1
face 1
against 1
her 1
father 1
s 1
arm 1
Leave 1
my 1
home 1
Now 1
said 1
Mr 1
Samsa 1
indicating 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
without 1
letting 1
the 1
women 1
from 1
him 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
asked 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
somewhat 1
disconcerted 1
and 1
he 1
smiled 1
sweetly 1
The 1
other 1
two 1
held 1
their 1
hands 1
behind 1
their 1
backs 1
and 1
continually 1
rubbed 1
them 1
together 1
in 1
gleeful 1
anticipation 1
of 1
a 1
loud 1
quarrel 1
which 1
could 1
only 1
end 1
in 1
their 1
favour 1
I 1
mean 1
just 1
what 1
I 1
said 1
answered 1
Mr 1
Samsa 1
and 1
with 1
his 1
two 1
companions 1
went 1
in 1
a 1
straight 1
line 1
towards 1
the 1
man 1
At 1
first 1
he 1
stood 1
there 1
still 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
ground 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
contents 1
of 1
his 1
head 1
were 1
rearranging 1
themselves 1
into 1
new 1
positions 1
Alright 1
we 1
ll 1
go 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
and 1
looked 1
up 1
at 1
Mr 1
Samsa 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
suddenly 1
overcome 1
with 1
humility 1
and 1
wanted 1
permission 1
again 1
from 1
Mr 1
Samsa 1
for 1
his 1
decision 1
Mr 1
Samsa 1
merely 1
opened 1
his 1
eyes 1
wide 1
and 1
briefly 1
nodded 1
to 1
him 1
several 1
times 1
At 1
that 1
and 1
without 1
delay 1
the 1
man 1
actually 1
did 1
take 1
long 1
strides 1
into 1
the 1
front 1
hallway 1
his 1
two 1
friends 1
had 1
stopped 1
rubbing 1
their 1
hands 1
some 1
time 1
before 1
and 1
had 1
been 1
listening 1
to 1
what 1
was 1
being 1
said 1
Now 1
they 1
jumped 1
off 1
after 1
their 1
friend 1
as 1
if 1
taken 1
with 1
a 1
sudden 1
fear 1
that 1
Mr 1
Samsa 1
might 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
hallway 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
break 1
the 1
connection 1
with 1
their 1
leader 1
Once 1
there 1
all 1
three 1
took 1
their 1
hats 1
from 1
the 1
stand 1
took 1
their 1
sticks 1
from 1
the 1
holder 1
bowed 1
without 1
a 1
word 1
and 1
left 1
the 1
premises 1
Mr 1
Samsa 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
women 1
followed 1
them 1
out 1
onto 1
the 1
landing 1
but 1
they 1
had 2
no 1
reason 1
to 1
mistrust 1
the 1
men 1
s 1
intentions 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
leaned 1
over 1
the 1
landing 1
they 1
saw 1
how 1
the 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
made 1
slow 1
but 1
steady 1
progress 1
down 1
the 1
many 1
steps 1
As 1
they 1
turned 1
the 1
corner 1
on 1
each 1
floor 1
they 1
disappeared 1
and 1
would 1
reappear 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
later 1
the 1
further 1
down 1
they 1
went 1
the 1
more 1
that 1
the 1
Samsa 1
family 1
lost 1
interest 1
in 1
them 1
when 1
a 1
butcher 1
s 1
boy 1
proud 1
of 1
posture 1
with 1
his 1
tray 1
on 1
his 1
head 1
passed 1
them 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
up 1
and 1
came 1
nearer 1
than 1
they 1
were 1
Mr 1
Samsa 1
and 1
the 1
women 1
came 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
landing 1
and 1
went 1
as 1
if 1
relieved 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
flat 1
They 1
decided 1
the 1
best 1
way 1
to 1
make 1
use 1
of 1
that 1
day 1
was 1
for 1
relaxation 1
and 1
to 1
go 1
for 1
a 1
walk 1
not 1
only 1
had 1
they 1
earned 1
a 1
break 1
from 1
work 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
in 1
serious 1
need 1
of 1
it 1
So 1
they 1
sat 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
wrote 1
three 1
letters 1
of 1
excusal 1
Mr 1
Samsa 1
to 1
his 1
employers 1
Mrs 1
Samsa 1
to 1
her 1
contractor 1
and 1
Grete 1
to 1
her 1
principal 1
The 1
cleaner 1
came 1
in 1
while 1
they 1
were 1
writing 1
to 1
tell 1
them 1
she 1
was 1
going 1
she 1
d 1
finished 1
her 1
work 1
for 1
that 1
morning 1
The 1
three 1
of 1
them 1
at 1
first 1
just 1
nodded 1
without 1
looking 1
up 1
from 1
what 1
they 1
were 1
writing 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
when 1
the 1
cleaner 1
still 1
did 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
want 1
to 1
leave 1
that 1
they 1
looked 1
up 1
in 1
irritation 1
Well 1
asked 1
Mr 1
Samsa 1
The 1
charwoman 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
doorway 1
with 1
a 1
smile 1
on 1
her 1
face 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
some 1
tremendous 1
good 1
news 1
to 1
report 1
but 1
would 1
only 1
do 1
it 1
if 1
she 1
was 1
clearly 1
asked 1
to 1
The 1
almost 1
vertical 1
little 1
ostrich 1
feather 1
on 1
her 1
hat 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
source 1
of 1
irritation 1
to 1
Mr 1
Samsa 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
working 1
for 1
them 1
swayed 1
gently 1
in 1
all 1
directions 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
you 1
want 1
then 1
asked 1
Mrs 1
Samsa 1
whom 1
the 1
cleaner 1
had 1
the 1
most 1
respect 1
for 1
Yes 1
she 1
answered 1
and 1
broke 1
into 1
a 1
friendly 1
laugh 1
that 1
made 1
her 1
unable 1
to 1
speak 1
straight 1
away 1
well 1
then 1
that 1
thing 1
in 1
there 1
you 1
needn 1
t 1
worry 1
about 1
how 1
you 1
re 1
going 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
it 1
That 1
s 1
all 1
been 1
sorted 1
out 1
Mrs 1
Samsa 1
and 1
Grete 1
bent 1
down 1
over 1
their 1
letters 1
as 1
if 1
intent 1
on 1
continuing 1
with 1
what 1
they 1
were 1
writing 1
Mr 1
Samsa 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
cleaner 1
wanted 1
to 1
start 1
describing 1
everything 1
in 1
detail 1
but 1
with 1
outstretched 1
hand 1
he 1
made 1
it 1
quite 1
clear 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
So 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
prevented 1
from 1
telling 1
them 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
she 1
suddenly 1
remembered 1
what 1
a 1
hurry 1
she 1
was 1
in 1
and 1
clearly 1
peeved 1
called 1
out 1
Cheerio 1
then 1
everyone 1
turned 1
round 1
sharply 1
and 1
left 1
slamming 1
the 1
door 1
terribly 1
as 1
she 1
went 1
Tonight 1
she 1
gets 1
sacked 1
said 1
Mr 1
Samsa 1
but 1
he 1
received 1
no 1
reply 1
from 1
either 1
his 1
wife 1
or 1
his 1
daughter 1
as 1
the 1
charwoman 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
destroyed 1
the 1
peace 1
they 1
had 1
only 1
just 1
gained 1
They 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
where 1
they 1
remained 1
with 1
their 1
arms 1
around 1
each 1
other 1
Mr 1
Samsa 1
twisted 1
round 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
them 1
and 1
sat 1
there 1
watching 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
Then 1
he 1
called 1
out 1
Come 1
here 1
then 1
Let 1
s 1
forget 1
about 1
all 1
that 1
old 1
stuff 1
shall 1
we 1
Come 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
attention 1
The 1
two 1
women 1
immediately 1
did 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
hurrying 1
over 1
to 1
him 1
where 1
they 1
kissed 1
him 1
and 1
hugged 1
him 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
quickly 1
finished 1
their 1
letters 1
After 1
that 1
the 1
three 1
of 1
them 1
left 1
the 1
flat 1
together 1
which 1
was 1
something 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
done 1
for 1
months 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
tram 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
open 1
country 1
outside 1
the 1
town 1
They 1
had 1
the 1
tram 1
filled 1
with 1
warm 1
sunshine 1
all 1
to 1
themselves 1
Leant 1
back 1
comfortably 1
on 1
their 1
seats 1
they 1
discussed 1
their 1
prospects 1
and 1
found 1
that 1
on 1
closer 1
examination 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
bad 1
until 1
then 1
they 1
had 1
never 1
asked 1
each 1
other 1
about 1
their 1
work 1
but 1
all 1
three 1
had 1
jobs 1
which 1
were 1
very 1
good 1
and 1
held 1
particularly 1
good 1
promise 1
for 1
the 1
future 1
The 1
greatest 1
improvement 1
for 1
the 1
time 1
being 1
of 1
course 1
would 1
be 1
achieved 1
quite 1
easily 1
by 1
moving 1
house 1
what 1
they 1
needed 1
now 1
was 1
a 1
flat 1
that 1
was 1
smaller 1
and 1
cheaper 1
than 1
the 1
current 1
one 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
chosen 1
by 1
Gregor 1
one 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
better 1
location 1
and 1
most 1
of 1
all 1
more 1
practical 1
All 1
the 1
time 1
Grete 1
was 1
becoming 1
livelier 1
With 1
all 1
the 1
worry 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
having 1
of 1
late 1
her 1
cheeks 1
had 1
become 1
pale 1
but 1
while 1
they 1
were 1
talking 1
Mr 1
and 1
Mrs 1
Samsa 1
were 1
struck 1
almost 1
simultaneously 1
with 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
how 1
their 1
daughter 1
was 1
blossoming 1
into 1
a 1
well 1
built 1
and 1
beautiful 1
young 1
lady 1
They 1
became 1
quieter 1
Just 1
from 1
each 1
other 1
s 1
glance 1
and 1
almost 1
without 1
knowing 1
it 1
they 1
agreed 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
soon 1
be 1
time 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
good 1
man 1
for 1
her 1
And 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
confirmation 1
of 1
their 1
new 1
dreams 1
and 1
good 1
intentions 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
they 1
reached 1
their 1
destination 1
Grete 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
and 1
stretch 1
out 1
her 1
young 1
body 1
