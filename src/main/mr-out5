a 1

The 1
shadings 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
done 1
in 1
a 1
haphazard 1
fashion 1
or 1
by 1
guesswork 1

painstakingly 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
trustworthy 1
guidance 1
and 1
support 1
of 1
personal 1
familiarity 1
with 1
these 1
several 1
forms 1

I 1
make 1
this 1
explanation 1
for 1
the 1
reason 1
that 1
without 1
it 1
many 1

CHAPTER 1
I 1
YOU 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
about 1
me 1
without 1
you 1
have 1
read 1
a 1
book 1
by 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
The 1
Adventures 1
of 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
but 1
that 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
matter 1
That 1
book 1
was 1
made 1
by 1
Mr 1
Mark 1
Twain 1
and 1
he 1
told 1
the 1
truth 1
mainly 1
There 1
was 1
things 1
which 1
he 1
stretched 1
but 1
mainly 1
he 1
told 1
the 1
truth 1
That 1
is 1
nothing 1
I 1
never 1
seen 1
anybody 1
but 1
lied 1
one 1
time 1
or 1
another 1
without 1
it 1
was 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
or 1
the 1
widow 1
or 1
maybe 1
Mary 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
Tom 1
s 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
she 1
is 1
and 1
Mary 1
and 1
the 1
Widow 1
Douglas 1
is 1
all 1
told 1
about 1
in 1
that 1
book 1
which 1
is 1
mostly 1
a 1
true 1
book 1
with 1
some 1
stretchers 1
as 1
I 1
said 1
before 1
Now 1
the 1
way 1
that 1
the 1
book 1
winds 1
up 1
is 1
this 1
Tom 1
and 1
me 1
found 1
the 1
money 1
that 1
the 1
robbers 1
hid 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
and 1
it 1
made 1
us 1
rich 1
We 1
got 1
six 1
thousand 1
dollars 1
apiece 1
all 1
gold 1
It 1
was 1
an 1
awful 1
sight 1
of 1
money 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
piled 1
up 1
Well 1
Judge 1
Thatcher 1
he 1
took 1
it 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
out 1
at 1
interest 1
and 1
it 1
fetched 1
us 1
a 1
dollar 1
a 1
day 1
apiece 1
all 1
the 1
year 1
round 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
body 1
could 1
tell 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
The 1
Widow 1
Douglas 1
she 1
took 1
me 1
for 1
her 1
son 1
and 1
allowed 1
she 1
would 1
sivilize 1
me 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
rough 1
living 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
considering 1
how 1
dismal 1
regular 1
and 1
decent 1
the 1
widow 1
was 1
in 1
all 1
her 1
ways 1
and 1
so 1
when 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
stand 1
it 1
no 1
longer 1
I 1
lit 1
out 1
I 1
got 1
into 1
my 1
old 1
rags 1
and 1
my 1
sugar 1
hogshead 1
again 1
and 1
was 1
free 1
and 1
satisfied 1
But 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
he 1
hunted 1
me 1
up 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
start 1
a 1
band 1
of 1
robbers 1
and 1
I 1
might 1
join 1
if 1
I 1
would 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
widow 1
and 1
be 1
respectable 1
So 1
I 1
went 1
back 1
The 1
widow 1
she 1
cried 1
over 1
me 1
and 1
called 1
me 1
a 1
poor 1
lost 1
lamb 1
and 1
she 1
called 1
me 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
other 1
names 1
too 1
but 1
she 1
never 1
meant 1
no 1
harm 1
by 1
it 1
She 1
put 1
me 1
in 1
them 1
new 1
clothes 1
again 1
and 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
do 1
nothing 1
but 1
sweat 1
and 1
sweat 1
and 1
feel 1
all 1
cramped 1
up 1
Well 1
then 1
the 1
old 1
thing 1
commenced 1
again 1
The 1
widow 1
rung 1
a 1
bell 1
for 1
supper 1
and 1
you 1
had 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
time 1
When 1
you 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
go 1
right 1
to 1
eating 1
but 1
you 1
had 1
to 1
wait 1
for 1
the 1
widow 1
to 1
tuck 1
down 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
grumble 1
a 1
little 1
over 1
the 1
victuals 1
though 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
really 1
anything 1
the 1
matter 1
with 1
them 1
that 1
is 1
nothing 1
only 1
everything 1
was 1
cooked 1
by 1
itself 1
In 1
a 1
barrel 1
of 1
odds 1
and 1
ends 1
it 1
is 1
different 1
things 1
get 1
mixed 1
up 1
and 1
the 1
juice 1
kind 1
of 1
swaps 1
around 1
and 1
the 1
things 1
go 1
better 1
After 1
supper 1
she 1
got 1
out 1
her 1
book 1
and 1
learned 1
me 1
about 1
Moses 1
and 1
the 1
Bulrushers 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
sweat 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
all 1
about 1
him 1
but 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
she 1
let 1
it 1
out 1
that 1
Moses 1
had 1
been 1
dead 1
a 1
considerable 1
long 1
time 1
so 1
then 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
care 1
no 1
more 1
about 1
him 1
because 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
take 1
no 1
stock 1
in 1
dead 1
people 1
Pretty 1
soon 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
smoke 1
and 1
asked 1
the 1
widow 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
But 1
she 1
wouldn 1
t 1
She 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
mean 1
practice 1
and 1
wasn 1
t 1
clean 1
and 1
I 1
must 1
try 1
to 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
any 1
more 1
That 1
is 1
just 1
the 1
way 1
with 1
some 1
people 1
They 1
get 1
down 1
on 1
a 1
thing 1
when 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
nothing 1
about 1
it 1
Here 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
bothering 1
about 1
Moses 1
which 1
was 1
no 1
kin 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
anybody 1
being 1
gone 1
you 1
see 1
yet 1
finding 1
a 1
power 1
of 1
fault 1
with 1
me 1
for 1
doing 1
a 1
thing 1
that 1
had 1
some 1
good 1
in 1
it 1
And 1
she 1
took 1
snuff 1
too 1
of 1
course 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
because 1
she 1
done 1
it 1
herself 1
Her 1
sister 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
a 1
tolerable 1
slim 1
old 1
maid 1
with 1
goggles 1
on 1
had 1
just 1
come 1
to 1
live 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
set 1
at 1
me 1
now 1
with 1
a 1
spelling 1
book 1
She 1
worked 1
me 1
middling 1
hard 1
for 1
about 1
an 1
hour 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
widow 1
made 1
her 1
ease 1
up 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
stood 1
it 1
much 1
longer 1
Then 1
for 1
an 1
hour 1
it 1
was 1
deadly 1
dull 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
fidgety 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
would 1
say 1
Don 1
t 1
put 1
your 1
feet 1
up 1
there 1
Huckleberry 1
and 1
Don 1
t 1
scrunch 1
up 1
like 1
that 1
Huckleberry 1
set 1
up 1
straight 1
and 1
pretty 1
soon 1
she 1
would 1
say 1
Don 1
t 1
gap 1
and 1
stretch 1
like 1
that 1
Huckleberry 1
why 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
try 1
to 1
behave 1
Then 1
she 1
told 1
me 1
all 1
about 1
the 1
bad 1
place 1
and 1
I 1
said 1
I 1
wished 1
I 1
was 1
there 1
She 1
got 1
mad 1
then 1
but 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
mean 1
no 1
harm 1
All 1
I 1
wanted 1
was 1
to 1
go 1
somewheres 1
all 1
I 1
wanted 1
was 1
a 1
change 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
particular 1
She 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
wicked 1
to 1
say 1
what 1
I 1
said 2
she 1
wouldn 1
t 1
say 1
it 1
for 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
she 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
live 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
good 1
place 1
Well 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
no 1
advantage 1
in 1
going 1
where 1
she 1
was 1
going 1
so 1
I 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
try 1
for 1
it 1
But 1
I 1
never 1
said 1
so 1
because 1
it 1
would 1
only 1
make 1
trouble 1
and 1
wouldn 1
t 1
do 1
no 1
good 1
Now 1
she 1
had 1
got 1
a 1
start 1
and 1
she 1
went 1
on 1
and 1
told 1
me 1
all 1
about 1
the 1
good 1
place 1
She 1
said 1
all 1
a 1
body 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
do 1
there 1
was 1
to 1
go 1
around 1
all 1
day 1
long 1
with 1
a 1
harp 1
and 1
sing 1
forever 1
and 1
ever 1
So 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
think 1
much 1
of 1
it 1
But 1
I 1
never 1
said 1
so 1
I 1
asked 1
her 1
if 1
she 1
reckoned 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
would 1
go 1
there 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
not 1
by 1
a 1
considerable 1
sight 1
I 1
was 1
glad 1
about 1
that 1
because 1
I 1
wanted 1
him 1
and 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
together 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
she 1
kept 1
pecking 1
at 1
me 1
and 1
it 1
got 1
tiresome 1
and 1
lonesome 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
they 1
fetched 1
the 1
niggers 1
in 1
and 1
had 1
prayers 1
and 1
then 1
everybody 1
was 1
off 1
to 1
bed 1
I 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
my 1
room 1
with 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
candle 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
Then 1
I 1
set 1
down 1
in 1
a 1
chair 1
by 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
something 1
cheerful 1
but 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
use 1
I 1
felt 1
so 1
lonesome 1
I 1
most 1
wished 1
I 1
was 1
dead 1
The 1
stars 1
were 1
shining 1
and 1
the 1
leaves 1
rustled 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
ever 1
so 1
mournful 1
and 1
I 1
heard 1
an 1
owl 1
away 1
off 1
who 1
whooing 1
about 1
somebody 1
that 1
was 1
dead 1
and 1
a 1
whippowill 1
and 1
a 1
dog 1
crying 1
about 1
somebody 1
that 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
die 1
and 1
the 1
wind 1
was 1
trying 1
to 1
whisper 1
something 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
make 1
out 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
and 1
so 1
it 1
made 1
the 1
cold 1
shivers 1
run 1
over 1
me 1
Then 1
away 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
I 1
heard 1
that 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
sound 1
that 1
a 1
ghost 1
makes 1
when 1
it 1
wants 1
to 1
tell 1
about 1
something 1
that 1
s 1
on 1
its 1
mind 1
and 1
can 1
t 1
make 1
itself 1
understood 1
and 1
so 1
can 1
t 1
rest 1
easy 1
in 1
its 1
grave 1
and 1
has 1
to 1
go 1
about 1
that 1
way 1
every 1
night 1
grieving 1
I 1
got 1
so 1
down 1
hearted 1
and 1
scared 1
I 1
did 1
wish 1
I 1
had 1
some 1
company 1
Pretty 1
soon 1
a 1
spider 1
went 1
crawling 1
up 1
my 1
shoulder 1
and 1
I 1
flipped 1
it 1
off 1
and 1
it 1
lit 1
in 1
the 1
candle 1
and 1
before 1
I 1
could 1
budge 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
shriveled 1
up 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
need 1
anybody 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
that 2
was 1
an 1
awful 1
bad 1
sign 1
and 1
would 1
fetch 1
me 1
some 1
bad 1
luck 1
so 1
I 1
was 1
scared 1
and 1
most 1
shook 1
the 1
clothes 1
off 1
of 1
me 1
I 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
turned 1
around 1
in 1
my 1
tracks 1
three 1
times 1
and 1
crossed 1
my 1
breast 1
every 1
time 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
tied 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
lock 1
of 1
my 1
hair 1
with 1
a 1
thread 1
to 1
keep 1
witches 1
away 1
But 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
no 1
confidence 1
You 1
do 1
that 1
when 1
you 1
ve 1
lost 1
a 1
horseshoe 1
that 1
you 1
ve 1
found 1
instead 1
of 1
nailing 1
it 1
up 1
over 1
the 1
door 1
but 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
ever 1
heard 1
anybody 1
say 1
it 1
was 1
any 1
way 1
to 1
keep 1
off 1
bad 1
luck 1
when 1
you 1
d 1
killed 1
a 1
spider 1
I 1
set 1
down 1
again 1
a 1
shaking 1
all 1
over 1
and 1
got 1
out 1
my 1
pipe 1
for 1
a 1
smoke 1
for 1
the 1
house 1
was 1
all 1
as 1
still 1
as 1
death 1
now 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
widow 1
wouldn 1
t 1
know 1
Well 1
after 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
clock 1
away 1
off 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
go 1
boom 3
twelve 1
licks 1
and 1
all 1
still 1
again 1
stiller 1
than 1
ever 1
Pretty 1
soon 1
I 1
heard 1
a 1
twig 1
snap 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
amongst 1
the 1
trees 1
something 1
was 1
a 1
stirring 1
I 1
set 1
still 1
and 1
listened 1
Directly 1
I 1
could 1
just 1
barely 1
hear 1
a 1
me 1
yow 1
me 1
yow 1
down 1
there 1
That 1
was 1
good 1
Says 1
I 1
me 1
yow 1
me 1
yow 1
as 1
soft 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
put 1
out 1
the 1
light 1
and 1
scrambled 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
shed 1
Then 1
I 1
slipped 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
crawled 1
in 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
sure 1
enough 1
there 1
was 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
waiting 1
for 1
me 1
CHAPTER 1
II 1
WE 1
went 1
tiptoeing 1
along 1
a 1
path 1
amongst 1
the 1
trees 1
back 1
towards 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
widow 1
s 1
garden 1
stooping 1
down 1
so 1
as 1
the 1
branches 1
wouldn 1
t 1
scrape 1
our 1
heads 1
When 1
we 1
was 1
passing 1
by 1
the 1
kitchen 1
I 1
fell 1
over 1
a 1
root 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
noise 1
We 1
scrouched 1
down 1
and 1
laid 1
still 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
s 1
big 1
nigger 1
named 1
Jim 1
was 1
setting 1
in 1
the 1
kitchen 1
door 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
him 1
pretty 1
clear 1
because 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
light 1
behind 1
him 1
He 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
stretched 1
his 1
neck 1
out 1
about 1
a 1
minute 1
listening 1
Then 1
he 1
says 1
Who 1
dah 1
He 1
listened 1
some 1
more 1
then 1
he 1
come 1
tiptoeing 1
down 1
and 1
stood 1
right 1
between 1
us 1
we 1
could 1
a 1
touched 1
him 1
nearly 1
Well 1
likely 1
it 1
was 1
minutes 1
and 1
minutes 1
that 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
a 1
sound 1
and 1
we 1
all 1
there 1
so 1
close 1
together 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
place 1
on 1
my 1
ankle 1
that 1
got 1
to 1
itching 1
but 1
I 1
dasn 1
t 1
scratch 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
my 1
ear 1
begun 1
to 1
itch 1
and 1
next 1
my 1
back 1
right 1
between 1
my 1
shoulders 1
Seemed 1
like 1
I 1
d 1
die 1
if 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
scratch 1
Well 1
I 1
ve 1
noticed 1
that 1
thing 1
plenty 1
times 1
since 1
If 1
you 1
are 1
with 1
the 1
quality 1
or 1
at 1
a 1
funeral 1
or 1
trying 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
sleep 1
when 1
you 1
ain 1
t 1
sleepy 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
anywheres 1
where 1
it 1
won 1
t 1
do 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
scratch 1
why 1
you 1
will 1
itch 1
all 1
over 1
in 1
upwards 1
of 1
a 1
thousand 1
places 1
Pretty 1
soon 1
Jim 1
says 1
Say 1
who 1
is 1
you 1
Whar 1
is 1
you 1
Dog 1
my 1
cats 1
ef 1

Well 1
I 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
s 1
gwyne 1
to 1

gwyne 1
to 1
set 1
down 1
here 1
and 1
listen 1

hears 1
it 1
agin 1
So 1
he 1
set 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
betwixt 1
me 1
and 1
Tom 1
He 1
leaned 1
his 1
back 1
up 1
against 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
stretched 1
his 1
legs 1
out 1
till 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
most 1
touched 1
one 1
of 1
mine 1
My 1
nose 1
begun 1
to 1
itch 1
It 1
itched 1
till 1
the 1
tears 1
come 1
into 1
my 1
eyes 1
But 1
I 1
dasn 1
t 1
scratch 1
Then 1
it 1
begun 1
to 1
itch 1
on 1
the 1
inside 1
Next 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
itching 1
underneath 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
how 1
I 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
set 1
still 1
This 1
miserableness 1
went 1
on 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
six 1
or 1
seven 1
minutes 1
but 1
it 1
seemed 1
a 1
sight 1
longer 1
than 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
itching 1
in 1
eleven 1
different 1
places 1
now 1
I 1
reckoned 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
stand 1
it 1
more 1
n 1
a 1
minute 1
longer 1
but 1
I 1
set 1
my 1
teeth 1
hard 1
and 1
got 1
ready 1
to 1
try 1
Just 1
then 1
Jim 1
begun 1
to 1
breathe 1
heavy 1
next 1
he 1
begun 1
to 1
snore 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
was 1
pretty 1
soon 1
comfortable 1
again 1
Tom 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
sign 1
to 1
me 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
little 1
noise 1
with 1
his 1
mouth 1
and 1
we 1
went 1
creeping 1
away 1
on 1
our 1
hands 1
and 1
knees 1
When 1
we 1
was 1
ten 1
foot 1
off 1
Tom 1
whispered 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
tie 1
Jim 1
to 1
the 1
tree 1
for 1
fun 1
But 1
I 1
said 1
no 1
he 1
might 1
wake 1
and 1
make 1
a 1
disturbance 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
d 1
find 1
out 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
in 1
Then 1
Tom 1
said 1
he 1
hadn 1
t 1
got 1
candles 1
enough 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
slip 1
in 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
get 1
some 1
more 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
him 1
to 1
try 1
I 1
said 1
Jim 1
might 1
wake 1
up 1
and 1
come 1
But 1
Tom 1
wanted 1
to 1
resk 1
it 1
so 1
we 1
slid 1
in 1
there 1
and 1
got 1
three 1
candles 1
and 1
Tom 1
laid 1
five 1
cents 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
for 1
pay 1
Then 1
we 1
got 1
out 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
sweat 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
but 1
nothing 1
would 1
do 1
Tom 1
but 1
he 1
must 1
crawl 1
to 1
where 1
Jim 1
was 1
on 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
knees 1
and 1
play 1
something 1
on 1
him 1
I 1
waited 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
a 1
good 1
while 1
everything 1
was 1
so 1
still 1
and 1
lonesome 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
Tom 1
was 1
back 1
we 1
cut 1
along 1
the 1
path 1
around 1
the 1
garden 1
fence 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
fetched 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
steep 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
hill 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
Tom 1
said 1
he 1
slipped 1
Jim 1
s 1
hat 1
off 1
of 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
hung 1
it 1
on 1
a 1
limb 1
right 1
over 1
him 1
and 1
Jim 1
stirred 1
a 1
little 1
but 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
wake 1
Afterwards 1
Jim 1
said 1
the 1
witches 1
be 1
witched 1
him 1
and 1
put 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
trance 1
and 1
rode 1
him 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
State 1
and 1
then 1
set 1
him 1
under 1
the 1
trees 1
again 1
and 1
hung 1
his 1
hat 1
on 1
a 1
limb 1
to 1
show 1
who 1
done 1
it 1
And 1
next 1
time 1
Jim 1
told 1
it 1
he 1
said 1
they 1
rode 1
him 1
down 1
to 1
New 1
Orleans 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
every 1
time 1
he 1
told 1
it 1
he 1
spread 1
it 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
till 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
he 1
said 1
they 1
rode 1
him 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
tired 1
him 1
most 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
his 1
back 1
was 1
all 1
over 1
saddle 1
boils 1
Jim 1
was 1
monstrous 1
proud 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
got 1
so 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
hardly 1
notice 1
the 1
other 1
niggers 1
Niggers 1
would 1
come 1
miles 1
to 1
hear 1
Jim 1
tell 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
more 1
looked 1
up 1
to 1
than 1
any 1
nigger 1
in 1
that 1
country 1
Strange 1
niggers 1
would 1
stand 1
with 1
their 1
mouths 1
open 1
and 1
look 1
him 1
all 1
over 1
same 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
wonder 1
Niggers 1
is 1
always 1
talking 1
about 1
witches 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
by 1
the 1
kitchen 1
fire 1
but 1
whenever 1
one 1
was 1
talking 1
and 1
letting 1
on 1
to 1
know 1
all 1
about 1
such 1
things 1
Jim 1
would 1
happen 1
in 1
and 1
say 1
Hm 1
What 1
you 1
know 1
bout 1
witches 1
and 1
that 1
nigger 1
was 1
corked 1
up 1
and 1
had 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
back 1
seat 1
Jim 1
always 1
kept 1
that 1
five 1
center 1
piece 1
round 1
his 1
neck 1
with 1
a 1
string 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
charm 1
the 1
devil 1
give 1
to 1
him 1
with 1
his 1
own 1
hands 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
he 1
could 1
cure 1
anybody 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
fetch 1
witches 1
whenever 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
just 1
by 1
saying 1
something 1
to 1
it 1
but 1
he 1
never 1
told 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
it 1
Niggers 1
would 1
come 1
from 1
all 1
around 1
there 1
and 1
give 1
Jim 1
anything 1
they 1
had 1
just 1
for 1
a 1
sight 1
of 1
that 1
five 1
center 1
piece 1
but 1
they 1
wouldn 1
t 1
touch 1
it 1
because 1
the 1
devil 1
had 2
his 1
hands 1
on 1
it 1
Jim 1
was 1
most 1
ruined 1
for 1
a 1
servant 1
because 1
he 1
got 1
stuck 1
up 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
having 1
seen 1
the 1
devil 1
and 1
been 1
rode 1
by 1
witches 1
Well 1
when 1
Tom 1
and 1
me 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
hilltop 1
we 1
looked 1
away 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
could 1
see 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
lights 1
twinkling 1
where 1
there 1
was 1
sick 1
folks 1
maybe 1
and 1
the 1
stars 1
over 1
us 1
was 1
sparkling 1
ever 1
so 1
fine 1
and 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
village 1
was 1
the 1
river 1
a 1
whole 1
mile 1
broad 1
and 1
awful 1
still 1
and 1
grand 1
We 1
went 1
down 1
the 1
hill 1
and 1
found 1
Jo 1
Harper 1
and 1
Ben 1
Rogers 1
and 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
more 1
of 1
the 1
boys 1
hid 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
tanyard 1
So 1
we 1
unhitched 1
a 1
skiff 1
and 1
pulled 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
two 1
mile 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
to 1
the 1
big 1
scar 1
on 1
the 1
hillside 1
and 1
went 1
ashore 1
We 1
went 1
to 1
a 1
clump 1
of 1
bushes 1
and 1
Tom 1
made 1
everybody 1
swear 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
secret 1
and 1
then 1
showed 1
them 1
a 1
hole 1
in 1
the 1
hill 1
right 1
in 1
the 1
thickest 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
bushes 1
Then 1
we 1
lit 1
the 1
candles 1
and 1
crawled 1
in 1
on 1
our 1
hands 1
and 1
knees 1
We 1
went 1
about 1
two 1
hundred 1
yards 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
cave 1
opened 1
up 1
Tom 1
poked 1
about 1
amongst 1
the 1
passages 1
and 1
pretty 1
soon 1
ducked 1
under 1
a 1
wall 1
where 1
you 1
wouldn 1
t 1
a 1
noticed 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
hole 1
We 1
went 1
along 1
a 1
narrow 1
place 1
and 1
got 1
into 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
room 1
all 1
damp 1
and 1
sweaty 1
and 1
cold 1
and 1
there 1
we 1
stopped 1
Tom 1
says 1
Now 1
we 1
ll 1
start 1
this 1
band 1
of 1
robbers 1
and 1
call 1
it 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
s 1
Gang 1
Everybody 1
that 1
wants 1
to 1
join 1
has 1
got 1
to 1
take 1
an 1
oath 1
and 1
write 1
his 1
name 1
in 1
blood 1
Everybody 1
was 1
willing 1
So 1
Tom 1
got 1
out 1
a 1
sheet 1
of 1
paper 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
wrote 1
the 1
oath 1
on 1
and 1
read 1
it 1
It 1
swore 1
every 1
boy 1
to 1
stick 1
to 1
the 1
band 1
and 1
never 1
tell 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
secrets 1
and 1
if 1
anybody 1
done 1
anything 1
to 1
any 1
boy 1
in 1
the 1
band 1
whichever 1
boy 1
was 1
ordered 1
to 1
kill 1
that 1
person 1
and 1
his 1
family 1
must 1
do 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
mustn 1
t 1
eat 1
and 1
he 1
mustn 1
t 1
sleep 1
till 1
he 1
had 1
killed 1
them 1
and 1
hacked 1
a 1
cross 1
in 1
their 1
breasts 1
which 1
was 1
the 1
sign 1
of 1
the 1
band 1
And 1
nobody 1
that 1
didn 1
t 1
belong 1
to 1
the 1
band 1
could 1
use 1
that 1
mark 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
sued 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
done 1
it 1
again 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
killed 1
And 1
if 1
anybody 1
that 1
belonged 1
to 1
the 1
band 1
told 1
the 1
secrets 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
his 1
throat 1
cut 1
and 1
then 1
have 1
his 1
carcass 1
burnt 1
up 1
and 1
the 1
ashes 1
scattered 1
all 1
around 1
and 1
his 1
name 1
blotted 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
list 1
with 1
blood 1
and 1
never 1
mentioned 1
again 1
by 1
the 1
gang 1
but 1
have 1
a 1
curse 1
put 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
be 1
forgot 1
forever 1
Everybody 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
real 1
beautiful 1
oath 1
and 1
asked 1
Tom 1
if 1
he 1
got 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
head 1
He 1
said 1
some 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
rest 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
pirate 1
books 1
and 1
robber 1
books 1
and 1
every 1
gang 1
that 1
was 1
high 1
toned 1
had 1
it 1
Some 1
thought 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
good 1
to 1
kill 1
the 1
families 1
of 1
boys 1
that 1
told 1
the 1
secrets 1
Tom 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
idea 1
so 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
pencil 1
and 1
wrote 1
it 1
in 1
Then 1
Ben 1
Rogers 1
says 1
Here 1
s 1
Huck 1
Finn 1
he 1
hain 1
t 1
got 1
no 1
family 1
what 1
you 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
bout 1
him 1
Well 1
hain 1
t 1
he 1
got 1
a 1
father 1
says 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
Yes 1
he 1
s 1
got 1
a 1
father 1
but 1
you 1
can 1
t 1
never 1
find 1
him 1
these 1
days 1
He 1
used 1
to 1
lay 1
drunk 1
with 1
the 1
hogs 1
in 1
the 1
tanyard 1
but 1
he 1
hain 1
t 1
been 1
seen 1
in 1
these 1
parts 1
for 1
a 1
year 1
or 1
more 1
They 1
talked 1
it 1
over 1
and 1
they 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
rule 1
me 1
out 1
because 1
they 1
said 1
every 1
boy 1
must 1
have 1
a 1
family 1
or 1
somebody 1
to 1
kill 1
or 1
else 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
be 1
fair 1
and 1
square 1
for 1
the 1
others 1
Well 1
nobody 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
anything 1
to 1
do 1
everybody 1
was 1
stumped 1
and 1
set 1
still 1
I 1
was 1
most 1
ready 1
to 1
cry 1
but 1
all 1
at 1
once 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
a 1
way 1
and 1
so 1
I 1
offered 1
them 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
they 1
could 1
kill 1
her 1
Everybody 1
said 1
Oh 1
she 1
ll 1
do 1
That 1
s 1
all 1
right 1
Huck 1
can 1
come 1
in 1
Then 1
they 1
all 1
stuck 1
a 1
pin 1
in 1
their 1
fingers 1
to 1
get 1
blood 1
to 1
sign 1
with 1
and 1
I 1
made 1
my 1
mark 1
on 1
the 1
paper 1
Now 1
says 1
Ben 1
Rogers 1
what 1
s 1
the 1
line 1
of 1
business 1
of 1
this 1
Gang 1
Nothing 1
only 1
robbery 1
and 1
murder 1
Tom 1
said 1
But 1
who 1
are 1
we 1
going 1
to 1
rob 1
houses 1
or 1
cattle 1
or 1
Stuff 1
stealing 1
cattle 1
and 1
such 1
things 1
ain 1
t 1
robbery 1
it 1
s 1
burglary 1
says 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
We 1
ain 1
t 1
burglars 1
That 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
sort 1
of 1
style 1
We 1
are 1
highwaymen 1
We 1
stop 1
stages 1
and 1
carriages 1
on 1
the 1
road 1
with 1
masks 1
on 1
and 1
kill 1
the 1
people 1
and 1
take 1
their 1
watches 1
and 1
money 1
Must 1
we 1
always 1
kill 1
the 1
people 1
Oh 1
certainly 1
It 1
s 1
best 1
Some 1
authorities 1
think 1
different 1
but 1
mostly 1
it 1
s 1
considered 1
best 1
to 1
kill 1
them 1
except 1
some 1
that 1
you 1
bring 1
to 1
the 1
cave 1
here 1
and 1
keep 1
them 1
till 1
they 1
re 1
ransomed 1
Ransomed 1
What 1
s 1
that 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
But 1
that 1
s 1
what 1
they 1
do 1
I 1
ve 1
seen 1
it 1
in 1
books 1
and 1
so 1
of 1
course 1
that 1
s 1
what 1
we 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
But 1
how 1
can 1
we 1
do 1
it 1
if 1
we 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
Why 1
blame 1
it 1
all 1
we 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
Don 1
t 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
it 1
s 1
in 1
the 1
books 1
Do 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
doing 1
different 1
from 1
what 1
s 1
in 1
the 1
books 1
and 1
get 1
things 1
all 1
muddled 1
up 1
Oh 1
that 1
s 1
all 1
very 1
fine 1
to 1
say 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
but 1
how 1
in 1
the 1
nation 1
are 1
these 1
fellows 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
ransomed 1
if 1
we 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
to 1
them 1
that 1
s 1
the 1
thing 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
get 1
at 1
Now 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
reckon 1
it 1
is 1
Well 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
But 1
per 1
aps 1
if 1
we 1
keep 1
them 1
till 1
they 1
re 1
ransomed 1
it 1
means 1
that 1
we 1
keep 1
them 1
till 1
they 1
re 1
dead 1
Now 1
that 1
s 1
something 1
like 1
That 1
ll 1
answer 1
Why 1
couldn 1
t 1
you 1
said 1
that 1
before 1
We 1
ll 1
keep 1
them 1
till 1
they 1
re 1
ransomed 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
a 1
bothersome 1
lot 1
they 1
ll 1
be 1
too 1
eating 1
up 1
everything 1
and 1
always 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
loose 1
How 1
you 1
talk 1
Ben 1
Rogers 1
How 1
can 1
they 1
get 1
loose 1
when 1
there 1
s 1
a 1
guard 1
over 1
them 1
ready 1
to 1
shoot 1
them 1
down 1
if 1
they 1
move 1
a 1
peg 1
A 1
guard 1
Well 1
that 1
is 1
good 1
So 1
somebody 1
s 1
got 1
to 1
set 1
up 1
all 1
night 1
and 1
never 1
get 1
any 1
sleep 1
just 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
watch 1
them 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
s 1
foolishness 1
Why 1
can 1
t 1
a 1
body 1
take 1
a 1
club 1
and 1
ransom 1
them 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
they 1
get 1
here 1
Because 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
in 1
the 1
books 1
so 1
that 1
s 1
why 1
Now 1
Ben 1
Rogers 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
do 1
things 1
regular 1
or 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
that 1
s 1
the 1
idea 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
reckon 1
that 1
the 1
people 1
that 1
made 1
the 1
books 1
knows 1
what 1
s 1
the 1
correct 1
thing 1
to 1
do 1
Do 1
you 1
reckon 1
you 1
can 1
learn 1
em 1
anything 1
Not 1
by 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
No 1
sir 1
we 1
ll 1
just 1
go 1
on 1
and 1
ransom 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
regular 1
way 1
All 1
right 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
mind 1
but 1
I 1
say 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
fool 1
way 1
anyhow 1
Say 1
do 1
we 1
kill 1
the 1
women 1
too 1
Well 1
Ben 1
Rogers 1
if 1
I 1
was 1
as 1
ignorant 1
as 1
you 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
let 1
on 1
Kill 1
the 1
women 1
No 1
nobody 1
ever 1
saw 1
anything 1
in 1
the 1
books 1
like 1
that 1
You 1
fetch 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
cave 1
and 1
you 1
re 1
always 1
as 1
polite 1
as 1
pie 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
they 1
fall 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
never 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
any 1
more 1
Well 1
if 1
that 1
s 1
the 1
way 1
I 1
m 1
agreed 1
but 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
take 1
no 1
stock 1
in 1
it 1
Mighty 1
soon 1
we 1
ll 1
have 1
the 1
cave 1
so 1
cluttered 1
up 1
with 1
women 1
and 1
fellows 1
waiting 1
to 1
be 1
ransomed 1
that 1
there 1
won 1
t 1
be 1
no 1
place 1
for 1
the 1
robbers 1
But 1
go 1
ahead 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
got 1
nothing 1
to 1
say 1
Little 1
Tommy 1
Barnes 1
was 1
asleep 1
now 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
waked 1
him 1
up 1
he 1
was 1
scared 1
and 1
cried 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
to 1
his 1
ma 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
robber 1
any 1
more 1
So 1
they 1
all 1
made 1
fun 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
called 1
him 1
cry 1
baby 1
and 1
that 1
made 1
him 1
mad 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
go 1
straight 1
and 1
tell 1
all 1
the 1
secrets 1
But 1
Tom 1
give 1
him 1
five 1
cents 1
to 1
keep 1
quiet 1
and 1
said 1
we 1
would 1
all 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
meet 1
next 1
week 1
and 1
rob 1
somebody 1
and 1
kill 1
some 1
people 1
Ben 1
Rogers 1
said 1
he 1
couldn 1
t 1
get 1
out 1
much 1
only 1
Sundays 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
begin 1
next 1
Sunday 1
but 1
all 1
the 1
boys 1
said 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
wicked 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
on 1
Sunday 1
and 1
that 1
settled 1
the 1
thing 1
They 1
agreed 1
to 1
get 1
together 1
and 1
fix 1
a 1
day 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
elected 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
first 1
captain 1
and 1
Jo 1
Harper 1
second 1
captain 1
of 1
the 1
Gang 1
and 1
so 1
started 1
home 1
I 1
clumb 1
up 1
the 1
shed 1
and 1
crept 1
into 1
my 1
window 1
just 1
before 1
day 1
was 1
breaking 1
My 1
new 1
clothes 1
was 1
all 1
greased 1
up 1
and 1
clayey 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
dog 1
tired 1
CHAPTER 1
III 1
WELL 1
I 1
got 1
a 1
good 1
going 1
over 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
from 1
old 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
my 1
clothes 1
but 1
the 1
widow 1
she 1
didn 1
t 1
scold 1
but 1
only 1
cleaned 1
off 1
the 1
grease 1
and 1
clay 1
and 1
looked 1
so 1
sorry 1
that 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
would 1
behave 1
awhile 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
Then 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
she 1
took 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
closet 1
and 1
prayed 1
but 1
nothing 1
come 1
of 1
it 1
She 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
pray 1
every 1
day 1
and 1
whatever 1
I 1
asked 1
for 1
I 1
would 1
get 1
it 1
But 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
so 1
I 1
tried 1
it 1
Once 1
I 1
got 1
a 1
fish 1
line 1
but 1
no 1
hooks 1
It 1
warn 1
t 1
any 1
good 1
to 1
me 1
without 1
hooks 1
I 1
tried 1
for 1
the 1
hooks 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
times 1
but 1
somehow 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
make 1
it 1
work 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
one 1
day 1
I 1
asked 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
to 1
try 1
for 1
me 1
but 1
she 1
said 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
fool 1
She 1
never 1
told 1
me 1
why 1
and 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
make 1
it 1
out 1
no 1
way 1
I 1
set 1
down 1
one 1
time 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
long 1
think 1
about 1
it 1
I 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
if 1
a 1
body 1
can 1
get 1
anything 1
they 1
pray 1
for 1
why 1
don 1
t 1
Deacon 1
Winn 1
get 1
back 1
the 1
money 1
he 1
lost 1
on 1
pork 1
Why 1
can 1
t 1
the 1
widow 1
get 1
back 1
her 1
silver 1
snuffbox 1
that 1
was 1
stole 1
Why 1
can 1
t 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
fat 1
up 1
No 1
says 1
I 1
to 1
my 1
self 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
nothing 1
in 1
it 1
I 1
went 1
and 1
told 1
the 1
widow 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
the 1
thing 1
a 1
body 1
could 1
get 1
by 1
praying 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
spiritual 1
gifts 1
This 1
was 1
too 1
many 1
for 1
me 1
but 1
she 1
told 1
me 1
what 1
she 1
meant 1
I 1
must 1
help 1
other 1
people 1
and 1
do 1
everything 1
I 1
could 1
for 1
other 1
people 1
and 1
look 1
out 1
for 1
them 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
never 1
think 1
about 1
myself 1
This 1
was 1
including 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
as 1
I 1
took 1
it 1
I 1
went 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
turned 1
it 1
over 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
but 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
no 1
advantage 1
about 1
it 1
except 1
for 1
the 1
other 1
people 1
so 1
at 1
last 1
I 1
reckoned 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
worry 1
about 1
it 1
any 1
more 1
but 1
just 1
let 1
it 1
go 1
Sometimes 1
the 1
widow 1
would 1
take 1
me 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
talk 1
about 1
Providence 1
in 1
a 1
way 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
body 1
s 1
mouth 1
water 1
but 1
maybe 1
next 1
day 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
would 1
take 1
hold 1
and 1
knock 1
it 1
all 1
down 1
again 1
I 1
judged 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
two 1
Providences 1
and 1
a 1
poor 1
chap 1
would 1
stand 1
considerable 1
show 1
with 1
the 1
widow 1
s 1
Providence 1
but 1
if 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
s 1
got 1
him 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
help 1
for 1
him 1
any 1
more 1
I 1
thought 1
it 1
all 1
out 1
and 1
reckoned 1
I 1
would 1
belong 1
to 1
the 1
widow 1
s 1
if 1
he 1
wanted 1
me 1
though 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
make 1
out 1
how 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
any 1
better 1
off 1
then 1
than 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
before 1
seeing 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
ignorant 1
and 1
so 1
kind 1
of 1
low 1
down 1
and 1
ornery 1
Pap 1
he 1
hadn 1
t 1
been 1
seen 1
for 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
year 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
comfortable 1
for 1
me 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
no 1
more 1
He 1
used 1
to 1
always 1
whale 1
me 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
sober 1
and 1
could 1
get 1
his 1
hands 1
on 1
me 1
though 1
I 1
used 1
to 1
take 1
to 1
the 1
woods 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
around 1
Well 1
about 1
this 1
time 1
he 1
was 1
found 1
in 1
the 1
river 1
drownded 1
about 1
twelve 1
mile 1
above 1
town 1
so 1
people 1
said 1
They 1
judged 1
it 1
was 1
him 1
anyway 1
said 1
this 1
drownded 1
man 1
was 1
just 1
his 1
size 1
and 1
was 1
ragged 1
and 1
had 1
uncommon 1
long 1
hair 1
which 1
was 1
all 1
like 1
pap 1
but 1
they 1
couldn 1
t 1
make 1
nothing 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
face 1
because 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
so 1
long 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
much 1
like 1
a 1
face 1
at 1
all 1
They 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
floating 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
They 1
took 1
him 1
and 1
buried 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
But 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
comfortable 1
long 1
because 1
I 1
happened 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
something 1
I 1
knowed 1
mighty 1
well 1
that 1
a 1
drownded 1
man 1
don 1
t 1
float 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
but 1
on 1
his 1
face 1
So 1
I 1
knowed 1
then 1
that 1
this 1
warn 1
t 1
pap 1
but 1
a 1
woman 1
dressed 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
clothes 1
So 1
I 1
was 1
uncomfortable 1
again 1
I 1
judged 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
would 1
turn 1
up 1
again 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
though 1
I 1
wished 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
We 1
played 1
robber 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
about 1
a 1
month 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
resigned 1
All 1
the 1
boys 1
did 1
We 1
hadn 1
t 1
robbed 1
nobody 1
hadn 1
t 1
killed 1
any 1
people 1
but 1
only 1
just 1
pretended 1
We 1
used 1
to 1
hop 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
go 1
charging 1
down 1
on 1
hog 1
drivers 1
and 1
women 1
in 1
carts 1
taking 1
garden 1
stuff 1
to 1
market 1
but 1
we 1
never 1
hived 1
any 1
of 1
them 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
called 1
the 1
hogs 1
ingots 1
and 1
he 1
called 1
the 1
turnips 1
and 1
stuff 1
julery 1
and 1
we 1
would 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
cave 1
and 1
powwow 1
over 1
what 1
we 1
had 1
done 1
and 1
how 1
many 1
people 1
we 1
had 1
killed 1
and 1
marked 1
But 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
no 1
profit 1
in 1
it 1
One 1
time 1
Tom 1
sent 1
a 1
boy 1
to 1
run 1
about 1
town 1
with 1
a 1
blazing 1
stick 1
which 1
he 1
called 1
a 1
slogan 1
which 1
was 1
the 1
sign 1
for 1
the 1
Gang 1
to 1
get 1
together 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
had 1
got 1
secret 1
news 1
by 1
his 1
spies 1
that 1
next 1
day 1
a 1
whole 1
parcel 1
of 1
Spanish 1
merchants 1
and 1
rich 1
A 1
rabs 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
camp 1
in 1
Cave 1
Hollow 1
with 1
two 1
hundred 1
elephants 1
and 1
six 1
hundred 1
camels 1
and 1
over 1
a 1
thousand 1
sumter 1
mules 1
all 1
loaded 1
down 1
with 1
di 1
monds 1
and 1
they 1
didn 1
t 1
have 1
only 1
a 1
guard 1
of 1
four 1
hundred 1
soldiers 1
and 1
so 1
we 1
would 1
lay 1
in 1
ambuscade 1
as 1
he 1
called 1
it 1
and 1
kill 1
the 1
lot 1
and 1
scoop 1
the 1
things 1
He 1
said 1
we 1
must 1
slick 1
up 1
our 1
swords 1
and 1
guns 1
and 1
get 1
ready 1
He 1
never 1
could 1
go 1
after 1
even 1
a 1
turnip 1
cart 1
but 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
the 1
swords 1
and 1
guns 1
all 1
scoured 1
up 1
for 1
it 1
though 1
they 1
was 1
only 1
lath 1
and 1
broomsticks 1
and 1
you 1
might 1
scour 1
at 1
them 1
till 1
you 1
rotted 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
warn 1
t 1
worth 1
a 1
mouthful 1
of 1
ashes 1
more 1
than 1
what 1
they 1
was 1
before 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
believe 1
we 1
could 1
lick 1
such 1
a 1
crowd 1
of 1
Spaniards 1
and 1
A 1
rabs 1
but 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
camels 1
and 1
elephants 1
so 1
I 1
was 1
on 1
hand 1
next 1
day 1
Saturday 1
in 1
the 1
ambuscade 1
and 1
when 1
we 1
got 1
the 1
word 1
we 1
rushed 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
hill 1
But 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
Spaniards 1
and 1
A 1
rabs 1
and 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
camels 1
nor 1
no 1
elephants 1
It 1
warn 1
t 1
anything 1
but 1
a 1
Sunday 1
school 1
picnic 1
and 1
only 1
a 1
primer 1
class 1
at 1
that 1
We 1
busted 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
chased 1
the 1
children 1
up 1
the 1
hollow 1
but 1
we 1
never 1
got 1
anything 1
but 1
some 1
doughnuts 1
and 1
jam 1
though 1
Ben 1
Rogers 1
got 1
a 1
rag 1
doll 1
and 1
Jo 1
Harper 1
got 1
a 1
hymn 1
book 1
and 1
a 1
tract 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
teacher 1
charged 1
in 1
and 1
made 1
us 1
drop 1
everything 1
and 1
cut 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
see 1
no 1
di 1
monds 1
and 1
I 1
told 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
so 1
He 1
said 1
there 1
was 1
loads 1
of 1
them 1
there 1
anyway 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
there 1
was 1
A 1
rabs 1
there 1
too 1
and 1
elephants 1
and 1
things 1
I 1
said 1
why 1
couldn 1
t 1
we 1
see 1
them 1
then 1
He 1
said 1
if 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
so 1
ignorant 1
but 1
had 1
read 1
a 1
book 1
called 1
Don 1
Quixote 1
I 1
would 1
know 1
without 1
asking 1
He 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
done 1
by 1
enchantment 1
He 1
said 1
there 1
was 1
hundreds 1
of 1
soldiers 1
there 1
and 1
elephants 1
and 1
treasure 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
but 1
we 1
had 1
enemies 1
which 1
he 1
called 1
magicians 1
and 1
they 1
had 1
turned 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
into 1
an 1
infant 1
Sunday 1
school 1
just 1
out 1
of 1
spite 1
I 1
said 1
all 1
right 1
then 1
the 1
thing 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
do 1
was 1
to 1
go 1
for 1
the 1
magicians 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
said 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
numskull 1
Why 1
said 1
he 1
a 1
magician 1
could 1
call 1
up 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
genies 1
and 1
they 1
would 1
hash 1
you 1
up 1
like 1
nothing 1
before 1
you 1
could 1
say 1
Jack 1
Robinson 1
They 1
are 1
as 1
tall 1
as 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
as 1
big 1
around 1
as 1
a 1
church 1
Well 1
I 1
says 1
s 1
pose 1
we 1
got 1
some 1
genies 1
to 1
help 1
us 1
can 1
t 1
we 1
lick 1
the 1
other 1
crowd 1
then 1
How 1
you 1
going 1
to 1
get 1
them 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
How 1
do 1
they 1
get 1
them 1
Why 1
they 1
rub 1
an 1
old 1
tin 1
lamp 1
or 1
an 1
iron 1
ring 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
genies 1
come 1
tearing 1
in 1
with 1
the 1
thunder 1
and 1
lightning 1
a 1
ripping 1
around 1
and 1
the 1
smoke 1
a 1
rolling 1
and 1
everything 1
they 1
re 1
told 1
to 1
do 1
they 1
up 1
and 1
do 1
it 1
They 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
nothing 1
of 1
pulling 1
a 1
shot 1
tower 1
up 1
by 1
the 1
roots 1
and 1
belting 1
a 1
Sunday 1
school 1
superintendent 1
over 1
the 1
head 1
with 1
it 1
or 1
any 1
other 1
man 1
Who 1
makes 1
them 1
tear 1
around 1
so 1
Why 1
whoever 1
rubs 1
the 1
lamp 1
or 1
the 1
ring 1
They 1
belong 1
to 1
whoever 1
rubs 1
the 1
lamp 1
or 1
the 1
ring 1
and 1
they 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
whatever 1
he 1
says 1
If 1
he 1
tells 1
them 1
to 1
build 1
a 1
palace 1
forty 1
miles 1
long 1
out 1
of 1
di 1
monds 1
and 1
fill 1
it 1
full 1
of 1
chewing 1
gum 1
or 1
whatever 1
you 1
want 1
and 1
fetch 1
an 1
emperor 1
s 1
daughter 1
from 1
China 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
marry 1
they 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
and 1
they 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
before 1
sun 1
up 1
next 1
morning 1
too 1
And 1
more 1
they 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
waltz 1
that 1
palace 1
around 1
over 1
the 1
country 1
wherever 1
you 1
want 1
it 1
you 1
understand 1
Well 1
says 1
I 2
think 1
they 1
are 1
a 1
pack 1
of 1
flat 1
heads 1
for 1
not 1
keeping 1
the 1
palace 1
themselves 1
stead 1
of 1
fooling 1
them 1
away 1
like 1
that 1
And 1
what 1
s 1
more 1
if 1
I 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
I 1
would 1
see 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
Jericho 1
before 1
I 1
would 1
drop 1
my 1
business 1
and 1
come 1
to 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
rubbing 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
tin 1
lamp 1
How 1
you 1
talk 1
Huck 1
Finn 1
Why 1
you 1
d 1
have 1
to 1
come 1
when 1
he 1
rubbed 1
it 1
whether 1
you 1
wanted 1
to 1
or 1
not 1
What 1
and 1
I 1
as 1
high 1
as 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
a 1
church 1
All 1
right 1
then 1
I 1
would 1
come 1
but 1
I 1
lay 1
I 1
d 1
make 1
that 1
man 1
climb 1
the 1
highest 1
tree 1
there 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
Shucks 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
you 1
Huck 1
Finn 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
know 1
anything 1
somehow 1
perfect 1
saphead 1
I 1
thought 1
all 1
this 1
over 1
for 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
days 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
reckoned 1
I 1
would 1
see 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
anything 1
in 1
it 1
I 1
got 1
an 1
old 1
tin 1
lamp 1
and 1
an 1
iron 1
ring 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
rubbed 1
and 1
rubbed 1
till 1
I 1
sweat 1
like 1
an 1
Injun 1
calculating 1
to 1
build 1
a 1
palace 1
and 1
sell 1
it 1
but 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
use 1
none 1
of 1
the 1
genies 1
come 1
So 1
then 1
I 1
judged 1
that 1
all 1
that 1
stuff 1
was 1
only 1
just 1
one 1
of 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
s 1
lies 1
I 1
reckoned 1
he 1
believed 1
in 1
the 1
A 1
rabs 1
and 1
the 1
elephants 1
but 1
as 1
for 1
me 1
I 1
think 1
different 1
It 1
had 1
all 1
the 1
marks 1
of 1
a 1
Sunday 1
school 1
CHAPTER 1
IV 1
WELL 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
months 1
run 1
along 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
well 1
into 1
the 1
winter 1
now 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
to 1
school 1
most 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
could 1
spell 1
and 1
read 1
and 1
write 1
just 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
could 1
say 1
the 1
multiplication 1
table 1
up 1
to 1
six 1
times 1
seven 1
is 1
thirty 1
five 1
and 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
reckon 1
I 1
could 1
ever 1
get 1
any 1
further 1
than 1
that 1
if 1
I 1
was 1
to 1
live 1
forever 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
take 1
no 1
stock 1
in 1
mathematics 1
anyway 1
At 1
first 1
I 1
hated 1
the 1
school 1
but 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
I 1
got 1
so 1
I 1
could 1
stand 1
it 1
Whenever 1
I 1
got 1
uncommon 1
tired 1
I 1
played 1
hookey 1
and 1
the 1
hiding 1
I 1
got 1
next 1
day 1
done 1
me 1
good 1
and 1
cheered 1
me 1
up 1
So 1
the 1
longer 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
school 1
the 1
easier 1
it 1
got 1
to 1
be 1
I 1
was 1
getting 1
sort 1
of 1
used 1
to 1
the 1
widow 1
s 1
ways 1
too 1
and 1
they 1
warn 1
t 1
so 1
raspy 1
on 1
me 1
Living 1
in 1
a 1
house 1
and 1
sleeping 1
in 1
a 1
bed 1
pulled 1
on 1
me 1
pretty 1
tight 1
mostly 1
but 1
before 1
the 1
cold 1
weather 1
I 1
used 1
to 1
slide 1
out 1
and 1
sleep 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
sometimes 1
and 1
so 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
rest 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
liked 1
the 1
old 1
ways 1
best 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
getting 1
so 1
I 1
liked 1
the 1
new 1
ones 1
too 1
a 1
little 1
bit 1
The 1
widow 1
said 1
I 1
was 1
coming 1
along 1
slow 1
but 1
sure 1
and 1
doing 1
very 1
satisfactory 1
She 1
said 1
she 1
warn 1
t 1
ashamed 1
of 1
me 1
One 1
morning 1
I 1
happened 1
to 1
turn 1
over 1
the 1
salt 1
cellar 1
at 1
breakfast 1
I 1
reached 1
for 1
some 1
of 1
it 1
as 1
quick 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
to 1
throw 1
over 1
my 1
left 1
shoulder 1
and 1
keep 1
off 1
the 1
bad 1
luck 1
but 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
was 1
in 1
ahead 1
of 1
me 1
and 1
crossed 1
me 1
off 1
She 1
says 1
Take 1
your 1
hands 1
away 1
Huckleberry 1
what 1
a 1
mess 1
you 1
are 1
always 1
making 1
The 1
widow 1
put 1
in 1
a 1
good 1
word 1
for 1
me 1
but 1
that 1
warn 1
t 1
going 1
to 1
keep 1
off 1
the 1
bad 1
luck 1
I 1
knowed 1
that 1
well 1
enough 1
I 1
started 1
out 1
after 1
breakfast 1
feeling 1
worried 1
and 1
shaky 1
and 1
wondering 1
where 1
it 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
fall 1
on 1
me 1
and 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
There 1
is 1
ways 1
to 1
keep 1
off 1
some 1
kinds 1
of 1
bad 1
luck 1
but 1
this 1
wasn 1
t 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
kind 1
so 1
I 1
never 1
tried 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
but 1
just 1
poked 1
along 1
low 1
spirited 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
watch 1
out 1
I 1
went 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
front 1
garden 1
and 1
clumb 1
over 1
the 1
stile 1
where 1
you 1
go 1
through 1
the 1
high 1
board 1
fence 1
There 1
was 1
an 1
inch 1
of 1
new 1
snow 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
I 1
seen 1
somebody 1
s 1
tracks 1
They 1
had 1
come 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
quarry 1
and 1
stood 1
around 1
the 1
stile 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
on 1
around 1
the 1
garden 1
fence 1
It 1
was 1
funny 1
they 1
hadn 1
t 1
come 1
in 1
after 1
standing 1
around 1
so 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
make 1
it 1
out 1
It 1
was 1
very 1
curious 1
somehow 1
I 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
follow 1
around 1
but 1
I 1
stooped 1
down 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
tracks 1
first 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
notice 1
anything 1
at 1
first 1
but 1
next 1
I 1
did 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
cross 1
in 1
the 1
left 1
boot 1
heel 1
made 1
with 1
big 1
nails 1
to 1
keep 1
off 1
the 1
devil 1
I 1
was 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
second 1
and 1
shinning 1
down 1
the 1
hill 1
I 1
looked 1
over 1
my 1
shoulder 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
but 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
see 1
nobody 1
I 1
was 1
at 1
Judge 1
Thatcher 1
s 1
as 1
quick 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
get 1
there 1
He 1
said 1
Why 1
my 1
boy 1
you 1
are 1
all 1
out 1
of 1
breath 1
Did 1
you 1
come 1
for 1
your 1
interest 1
No 1
sir 1
I 1
says 1
is 1
there 1
some 1
for 1
me 1
Oh 1
yes 1
a 1
half 1
yearly 1
is 1
in 1
last 1
night 1
over 1
a 1
hundred 1
and 1
fifty 1
dollars 1
Quite 1
a 1
fortune 1
for 1
you 1
You 1
had 1
better 1
let 1
me 1
invest 1
it 1
along 1
with 1
your 1
six 1
thousand 1
because 1
if 1
you 1
take 1
it 1
you 1
ll 1
spend 1
it 1
No 1
sir 1
I 1
says 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
spend 1
it 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
it 1
at 1
all 1
nor 1
the 1
six 1
thousand 1
nuther 1
I 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
take 1
it 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
give 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
the 1
six 1
thousand 1
and 1
all 1
He 1
looked 1
surprised 1
He 1
couldn 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
out 1
He 1
says 1
Why 1
what 1
can 1
you 1
mean 1
my 1
boy 1
I 1
says 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
ask 1
me 1
no 1
questions 1
about 1
it 1
please 1
You 1
ll 1
take 1
it 1
won 1
t 1
you 1
He 1
says 1
Well 1
I 1
m 1
puzzled 1
Is 1
something 1
the 1
matter 1
Please 1
take 1
it 1
says 1
I 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
ask 1
me 1
nothing 1
then 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
have 1
to 1
tell 1
no 1
lies 1
He 1
studied 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
says 1
Oho 1
o 1
I 1
think 1
I 1
see 1
You 1
want 1
to 1
sell 1
all 1
your 1
property 1
to 1
me 1
not 1
give 1
it 1
That 1
s 1
the 1
correct 1
idea 1
Then 1
he 1
wrote 1
something 1
on 1
a 1
paper 1
and 1
read 1
it 1
over 1
and 1
says 1
There 1
you 1
see 1
it 1
says 1
for 1
a 1
consideration 1
That 1
means 1
I 1
have 1
bought 1
it 1
of 1
you 1
and 1
paid 1
you 1
for 1
it 1
Here 1
s 1
a 1
dollar 1
for 1
you 1
Now 1
you 1
sign 1
it 1
So 1
I 1
signed 1
it 1
and 1
left 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
s 1
nigger 1
Jim 1
had 1
a 1
hair 1
ball 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
your 1
fist 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
took 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
fourth 1
stomach 1
of 1
an 1
ox 1
and 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
do 1
magic 1
with 1
it 1
He 1
said 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
spirit 1
inside 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
knowed 1
everything 1
So 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
night 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
pap 1
was 1
here 1
again 1
for 1
I 1
found 1
his 1
tracks 1
in 1
the 1
snow 1
What 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
was 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
was 1
he 1
going 1
to 1
stay 1
Jim 1
got 1
out 1
his 1
hair 1
ball 1
and 1
said 1
something 1
over 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
held 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
dropped 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
It 1
fell 1
pretty 1
solid 1
and 1
only 1
rolled 1
about 1
an 1
inch 1
Jim 1
tried 1
it 1
again 1
and 1
then 1
another 1
time 1
and 1
it 1
acted 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
Jim 1
got 1
down 1
on 1
his 1
knees 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
ear 1
against 1
it 1
and 1
listened 1
But 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
use 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
talk 1
He 1
said 1
sometimes 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
talk 1
without 1
money 1
I 1
told 1
him 1
I 1
had 1
an 1
old 1
slick 1
counterfeit 1
quarter 1
that 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
good 1
because 1
the 1
brass 1
showed 1
through 1
the 1
silver 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
pass 1
nohow 1
even 1
if 1
the 1
brass 1
didn 1
t 1
show 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
slick 1
it 1
felt 1
greasy 1
and 1
so 1
that 1
would 1
tell 1
on 1
it 1
every 1
time 1
I 1
reckoned 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
say 1
nothing 1
about 1
the 1
dollar 1
I 1
got 1
from 1
the 1
judge 1
I 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
pretty 1
bad 1
money 1
but 1
maybe 1
the 1
hair 1
ball 1
would 1
take 1
it 1
because 1
maybe 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
know 1
the 1
difference 1
Jim 1
smelt 1
it 1
and 1
bit 1
it 1
and 1
rubbed 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
manage 1
so 1
the 1
hair 1
ball 1
would 1
think 1
it 1
was 1
good 1
He 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
split 1
open 1
a 1
raw 1
Irish 1
potato 1
and 1
stick 1
the 1
quarter 1
in 1
between 1
and 1
keep 1
it 1
there 1
all 1
night 1
and 1
next 1
morning 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
no 1
brass 1
and 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
feel 1
greasy 1
no 1
more 1
and 1
so 1
anybody 1
in 1
town 1
would 1
take 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
minute 1
let 1
alone 1
a 1
hair 1
ball 1
Well 1
I 1
knowed 1
a 1
potato 1
would 1
do 1
that 1
before 1
but 1
I 1
had 1
forgot 1
it 1
Jim 1
put 1
the 1
quarter 1
under 1
the 1
hair 1
ball 1
and 1
got 1
down 1
and 1
listened 1
again 1
This 1
time 1
he 1
said 1
the 1
hair 1
ball 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
He 1
said 1
it 1
would 1
tell 1
my 1
whole 1
fortune 1
if 1
I 1
wanted 1
it 1
to 1
I 1
says 1
go 1
on 1
So 1
the 1
hair 1
ball 1
talked 1
to 1
Jim 1
and 1
Jim 1
told 1
it 1
to 1
me 1
He 1
says 1

CHAPTER 1
V 1
I 1
had 1
shut 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
Then 1
I 1
turned 1
around 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
was 1
I 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
scared 1
of 1
him 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
he 1
tanned 1
me 1
so 1
much 1
I 1
reckoned 1
I 1
was 1
scared 1
now 1
too 1
but 1
in 1
a 1
minute 1
I 1
see 1
I 1
was 1
mistaken 1
that 1
is 1
after 1
the 1
first 1
jolt 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
say 1
when 1
my 1
breath 1
sort 1
of 1
hitched 1
he 1
being 1
so 1
unexpected 1
but 1
right 1
away 1
after 1
I 1
see 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
scared 1
of 1
him 1
worth 1
bothring 1
about 1
He 1
was 1
most 1
fifty 1
and 1
he 1
looked 1
it 1
His 1
hair 1
was 1
long 1
and 1
tangled 1
and 1
greasy 1
and 1
hung 1
down 1
and 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
his 1
eyes 1
shining 1
through 1
like 1
he 1
was 1
behind 1
vines 1
It 1
was 1
all 1
black 1
no 1
gray 1
so 1
was 1
his 1
long 1
mixed 1
up 1
whiskers 1
There 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
color 1
in 1
his 1
face 1
where 1
his 1
face 1
showed 1
it 1
was 1
white 1
not 1
like 1
another 1
man 1
s 1
white 1
but 1
a 1
white 1

As 1

He 1

one 1
ankle 1
resting 1
on 1

boot 1
on 1
that 1
foot 1

of 1

through 1

His 1

to 1
take 1
me 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
and 1
let 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
be 1
my 1
guardian 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
new 1
judge 1
that 1
had 1
just 1
come 1
and 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
so 1
he 1
said 1
courts 1
mustn 1
t 1
interfere 1
and 1
separate 1
families 1
if 1
they 1
could 1
help 1
it 1
said 1
he 1
d 1
druther 1
not 1
take 1
a 1
child 1
away 1
from 1
its 1
father 1
So 1
Judge 1
Thatcher 1
and 1
the 1
widow 1
had 1
to 1
quit 1
on 1
the 1
business 1
That 1
pleased 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
till 1
he 1
couldn 1
t 1
rest 1
He 1
said 1
he 1
d 1
cowhide 1
me 1
till 1
I 1
was 1
black 1
and 1
blue 1
if 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
raise 1
some 1
money 1
for 1
him 1
I 1
borrowed 1
three 1
dollars 1
from 1
Judge 1
Thatcher 1
and 1
pap 1
took 1
it 1
and 1
got 1
drunk 1
and 1
went 1
a 1
blowing 1
around 1
and 1
cussing 1
and 1
whooping 1
and 1
carrying 1
on 1
and 1
he 1
kept 1
it 1
up 1
all 1
over 1
town 1
with 1
a 1
tin 1
pan 1
till 1
most 1
midnight 1
then 1
they 1
jailed 1
him 1
and 1
next 1
day 1
they 1
had 1
him 1
before 1
court 1
and 1
jailed 1
him 1
again 1
for 1
a 1
week 1
But 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
satisfied 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
boss 1
of 1
his 1
son 1
and 1
he 1
d 1
make 1
it 1
warm 1
for 1
him 1
When 1
he 1
got 1
out 1
the 1
new 1
judge 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
going 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
him 1
So 1
he 1
took 1
him 1
to 1
his 1
own 1
house 1
and 1
dressed 1
him 1
up 1
clean 1
and 1
nice 1
and 1
had 1
him 1
to 1
breakfast 1
and 1
dinner 1
and 1
supper 1
with 1
the 1
family 1
and 1
was 1
just 1
old 1
pie 1
to 1
him 1
so 1
to 1
speak 1
And 1
after 1
supper 1
he 1
talked 1
to 1
him 1
about 1
temperance 1
and 1
such 1
things 1
till 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
cried 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
d 1
been 1
a 1
fool 1
and 1
fooled 1
away 1
his 1
life 1
but 1
now 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
going 1
to 1
turn 1
over 1
a 1
new 1
leaf 1
and 1
be 1
a 1
man 1
nobody 1
wouldn 1
t 1
be 1
ashamed 1
of 1
and 1
he 1
hoped 1
the 1
judge 1
would 1
help 1
him 1
and 1
not 1
look 1
down 1
on 1
him 1
The 1
judge 1
said 1
he 1
could 1
hug 1
him 1
for 1
them 1
words 1
so 1
he 1
cried 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
she 1
cried 1
again 1
pap 1
said 1
he 1
d 1
been 1
a 1
man 1
that 1
had 1
always 1
been 1
misunderstood 1
before 1
and 1
the 1
judge 1
said 1
he 1
believed 1
it 1
The 1
old 1
man 1
said 1
that 1
what 1
a 1
man 1
wanted 1
that 1
was 1
down 1
was 1
sympathy 1
and 1
the 1
judge 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
so 2
they 1
cried 1
again 1
And 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
bedtime 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
rose 1
up 1
and 1
held 1
out 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
says 1
Look 1
at 1
it 1
gentlemen 1
and 1
ladies 1
all 1
take 1
a 1
hold 1
of 1
it 1
shake 1
it 1
There 1
s 1
a 1
hand 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
a 1
hog 1
but 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
so 1
no 1
more 1
it 1
s 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
that 1
s 1
started 1
in 1
on 1
a 1
new 1
life 1
and 1
ll 1
die 1
before 1
he 1
ll 1
go 1
back 1
You 1
mark 1
them 1
words 1
don 1
t 1
forget 1
I 1
said 1
them 1
It 1
s 1
a 1
clean 1
hand 1
now 1
shake 1
it 1
don 1
t 1
be 1
afeard 1
So 1
they 1
shook 1
it 1
one 1
after 1
the 1
other 1
all 1
around 1
and 1
cried 1
The 1
judge 1
s 1
wife 1
she 1
kissed 1
it 1
Then 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
he 1
signed 1
a 1
pledge 1
made 1
his 1
mark 1
The 1
judge 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
holiest 1
time 1
on 1
record 1
or 1
something 1
like 1
that 1
Then 1
they 1
tucked 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
into 1
a 1
beautiful 1
room 1
which 1
was 1
the 1
spare 1
room 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
some 1
time 1
he 1
got 1
powerful 1
thirsty 1
and 1
clumb 1
out 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
porch 1
roof 1
and 1
slid 1
down 1
a 1
stanchion 1
and 1
traded 1
his 1
new 1
coat 1
for 1
a 1
jug 1
of 1
forty 1
rod 1
and 1
clumb 1
back 1
again 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
old 1
time 1
and 1
towards 1
daylight 1
he 1
crawled 1
out 1
again 1
drunk 1
as 1
a 1
fiddler 1
and 1
rolled 1
off 1
the 1
porch 1
and 1
broke 1
his 1
left 1
arm 1
in 1
two 1
places 1
and 1
was 1
most 1
froze 1
to 1
death 1
when 1
somebody 1
found 1
him 1
after 1
sun 1
up 1
And 1
when 1
they 1
come 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
that 1
spare 1
room 1
they 1
had 1
to 1
take 1
soundings 1
before 1
they 1
could 1
navigate 1
it 1
The 1
judge 1
he 1
felt 1
kind 1
of 1
sore 1
He 1
said 1
he 1
reckoned 1
a 1
body 1
could 1
reform 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
shotgun 1
maybe 1
but 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
no 1
other 1
way 1
CHAPTER 1
VI 1
WELL 1
pretty 1
soon 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
was 1
up 1
and 1
around 1
again 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
for 1
Judge 1
Thatcher 1
in 1
the 1
courts 1
to 1
make 1
him 1
give 1
up 1
that 1
money 1
and 1
he 1
went 1
for 1
me 1
too 1
for 1
not 1
stopping 1
school 1
He 1
catched 1
me 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
times 1
and 1
thrashed 1
me 1
but 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
school 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
and 1
dodged 1
him 1
or 1
outrun 1
him 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
school 1
much 1
before 1
but 1
I 1
reckoned 1
I 1
d 1
go 1
now 1
to 1
spite 1
pap 1
That 1
law 1
trial 1
was 1
a 1
slow 1
business 1
appeared 1
like 1
they 1
warn 1
t 1
ever 1
going 1
to 1
get 1
started 1
on 1
it 1
so 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
d 1
borrow 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
dollars 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
judge 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
keep 1
from 1
getting 1
a 1
cowhiding 1
Every 1
time 1
he 1
got 1
money 1
he 1
got 1
drunk 1
and 1
every 1
time 1
he 1
got 1
drunk 1
he 1
raised 1
Cain 1
around 1
town 1
and 1
every 1
time 1
he 1
raised 1
Cain 1
he 1
got 1
jailed 1
He 1
was 1
just 1
suited 1
this 1
kind 1
of 1
thing 1
was 1
right 1
in 1
his 1
line 1
He 1
got 1
to 1
hanging 1
around 1
the 1
widow 1
s 1
too 1
much 1
and 1
so 1
she 1
told 1
him 1
at 1
last 1
that 1
if 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
quit 1
using 1
around 1
there 1
she 1
would 1
make 1
trouble 1
for 1
him 1
Well 1
wasn 1
t 1
he 1
mad 1
He 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
show 1
who 1
was 1
Huck 1
Finn 1
s 1
boss 1
So 1
he 1
watched 1
out 1
for 1
me 1
one 1
day 1
in 1
the 1
spring 1
and 1
catched 1
me 1
and 1
took 1
me 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
about 1
three 1
mile 1
in 1
a 1
skiff 1
and 1
crossed 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
Illinois 1
shore 1
where 1
it 1
was 1
woody 1
and 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
houses 1
but 1
an 1
old 1
log 1
hut 1
in 1
a 1
place 1
where 1
the 1
timber 1
was 1
so 1
thick 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
find 1
it 1
if 1
you 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
where 1
it 1
was 1
He 1
kept 1
me 1
with 1
him 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
I 1
never 1
got 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
run 1
off 1
We 1
lived 1
in 1
that 1
old 1
cabin 1
and 1
he 1
always 1
locked 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
put 1
the 1
key 1
under 1
his 1
head 1
nights 1
He 1
had 1
a 1
gun 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
stole 1
I 1
reckon 1
and 1
we 1
fished 1
and 1
hunted 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
what 1
we 1
lived 1
on 1
Every 1
little 1
while 1
he 1
locked 1
me 1
in 1
and 1
went 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
store 1
three 1
miles 1
to 1
the 1
ferry 1
and 1
traded 1
fish 1
and 1
game 1
for 1
whisky 1
and 1
fetched 1
it 1
home 1
and 1
got 1
drunk 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
time 1
and 1
licked 1
me 1
The 1
widow 1
she 1
found 1
out 1
where 1
I 1
was 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
she 1
sent 1
a 1
man 1
over 1
to 1
try 1
to 1
get 1
hold 1
of 1
me 1
but 1
pap 1
drove 1
him 1
off 1
with 1
the 1
gun 1
and 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
long 1
after 1
that 1
till 1
I 1
was 1
used 1
to 1
being 1
where 1
I 1
was 1
and 1
liked 1
it 1
all 1
but 1
the 1
cowhide 1
part 1
It 1
was 1
kind 1
of 1
lazy 1
and 1
jolly 1
laying 1
off 1
comfortable 1
all 1
day 1
smoking 1
and 1
fishing 1
and 1
no 1
books 1
nor 1
study 1
Two 1
months 1
or 1
more 1
run 1
along 1
and 1
my 1
clothes 1
got 1
to 1
be 1
all 1
rags 1
and 1
dirt 1
and 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
see 1
how 1
I 1
d 1
ever 1
got 1
to 1
like 1
it 1
so 1
well 1
at 1
the 1
widow 1
s 1
where 1
you 1
had 1
to 1
wash 1
and 1
eat 1
on 1
a 1
plate 1
and 1
comb 1
up 1
and 1
go 1
to 1
bed 1
and 1
get 1
up 1
regular 1
and 1
be 1
forever 1
bothering 1
over 1
a 1
book 1
and 1
have 1
old 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
pecking 1
at 1
you 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
no 1
more 1
I 1
had 1
stopped 1
cussing 1
because 1
the 1
widow 1
didn 1
t 1
like 1
it 1
but 1
now 1
I 1
took 1
to 1
it 1
again 1
because 1
pap 1
hadn 1
t 1
no 1
objections 1
It 1
was 1
pretty 1
good 1
times 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
there 1
take 1
it 1
all 1
around 1
But 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
pap 1
got 1
too 1
handy 1
with 1
his 1
hick 1
ry 1
and 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
stand 1
it 1
I 1
was 1
all 1
over 1
welts 1
He 1
got 1
to 1
going 1
away 1
so 1
much 1
too 1
and 1
locking 1
me 1
in 1
Once 1
he 1
locked 1
me 1
in 1
and 1
was 1
gone 1
three 1
days 1
It 1
was 1
dreadful 1
lonesome 1
I 1
judged 1
he 1
had 1
got 1
drownded 1
and 1
I 1
wasn 1
t 1
ever 1
going 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
any 1
more 1
I 1
was 1
scared 1
I 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
I 1
would 1
fix 1
up 1
some 1
way 1
to 1
leave 1
there 1
I 1
had 1
tried 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
that 1
cabin 1
many 1
a 1
time 1
but 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
find 1
no 1
way 1
There 1
warn 1
t 1
a 1
window 1
to 1
it 1
big 1
enough 1
for 1
a 1
dog 1
to 1
get 1
through 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
get 1
up 1
the 1
chimbly 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
narrow 1
The 1
door 1
was 1
thick 1
solid 1
oak 1
slabs 1
Pap 1
was 1
pretty 1
careful 1
not 1
to 1
leave 1
a 1
knife 1
or 1
anything 1
in 1
the 1
cabin 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
away 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
had 1
hunted 1
the 1
place 1
over 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
a 1
hundred 1
times 1
well 1
I 1
was 1
most 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
at 1
it 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
about 1
the 1
only 1
way 1
to 1
put 1
in 1
the 1
time 1
But 1
this 1
time 1
I 1
found 1
something 1
at 1
last 1
I 1
found 1
an 1
old 1
rusty 1
wood 1
saw 1
without 1
any 1
handle 1
it 1
was 1
laid 1
in 1
between 1
a 1
rafter 1
and 1
the 1
clapboards 1
of 1
the 1
roof 1
I 1
greased 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
work 1
There 1
was 1
an 1
old 1
horse 1
blanket 1
nailed 1
against 1
the 1
logs 1
at 1
the 1
far 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
cabin 1
behind 1
the 1
table 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
wind 1
from 1
blowing 1
through 1
the 1
chinks 1
and 1
putting 1
the 1
candle 1
out 1
I 1
got 1
under 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
raised 1
the 1
blanket 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
work 1
to 1
saw 1
a 1
section 1
of 1
the 1
big 1
bottom 1
log 1
out 1
big 1
enough 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
through 1
Well 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
long 1
job 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
getting 1
towards 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
it 1
when 1
I 1
heard 1
pap 1
s 1
gun 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
I 1
got 1
rid 1
of 1
the 1
signs 1
of 1
my 1
work 1
and 1
dropped 1
the 1
blanket 1
and 1
hid 1
my 1
saw 1
and 1
pretty 1
soon 1
pap 1
come 1
in 1
Pap 1
warn 1
t 1
in 1
a 1
good 1
humor 1
so 1
he 1
was 1
his 1
natural 1
self 1
He 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
down 1
town 1
and 1
everything 1
was 1
going 1
wrong 1
His 1
lawyer 1
said 1
he 1
reckoned 1
he 1
would 1
win 1
his 1
lawsuit 1
and 1
get 1
the 1
money 1
if 1
they 1
ever 1
got 1
started 1
on 1
the 1
trial 1
but 1
then 1
there 1
was 1
ways 1
to 1
put 1
it 1
off 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
and 1
Judge 1
Thatcher 1
knowed 1
how 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
And 1
he 1
said 1
people 1
allowed 1
there 1
d 1
be 1
another 1
trial 1
to 1
get 1
me 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
widow 1
for 1
my 1
guardian 1
and 1
they 1
guessed 1
it 1
would 1
win 1
this 1
time 1
This 1
shook 1
me 1
up 1
considerable 1
because 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
widow 1
s 1
any 1
more 1
and 1
be 1
so 1
cramped 1
up 1
and 1
sivilized 1
as 1
they 1
called 1
it 1
Then 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
got 1
to 1
cussing 1
and 1
cussed 1
everything 1
and 1
everybody 1
he 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
and 1
then 1
cussed 1
them 1
all 1
over 1
again 1
to 1
make 1
sure 1
he 1
hadn 1
t 1
skipped 1
any 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
he 1
polished 1
off 1
with 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
general 1
cuss 1
all 1
round 1
including 1
a 1
considerable 1
parcel 1
of 1
people 1
which 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
and 1
so 1
called 1
them 1
what 1
s 1
his 1
name 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
went 1
right 1
along 1
with 1
his 1
cussing 1
He 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
widow 1
get 1
me 1
He 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
watch 1
out 1
and 1
if 1
they 1
tried 1
to 1
come 1
any 1
such 1
game 1
on 1
him 1
he 1
knowed 1
of 1
a 1
place 1
six 1
or 1
seven 1
mile 1
off 1
to 1
stow 1
me 1
in 1
where 1
they 1
might 1
hunt 1
till 1
they 1
dropped 1
and 1
they 1
couldn 1
t 1
find 1
me 1
That 1
made 1
me 1
pretty 1
uneasy 1
again 1
but 1
only 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
I 1
reckoned 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
stay 1
on 1
hand 1
till 1
he 1
got 1
that 1
chance 1
The 1
old 1
man 1
made 1
me 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
skiff 1
and 1
fetch 1
the 1
things 1
he 1
had 1
got 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
fifty 1
pound 1
sack 1
of 1
corn 1
meal 1
and 1
a 1
side 1
of 1
bacon 1
ammunition 1
and 1
a 1
four 1
gallon 1
jug 1
of 1
whisky 1
and 1
an 1
old 1
book 1
and 1
two 1
newspapers 1
for 1
wadding 1
besides 1
some 1
tow 1
I 1
toted 1
up 1
a 1
load 1
and 1
went 1
back 1
and 1
set 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
bow 1
of 1
the 1
skiff 1
to 1
rest 1
I 1
thought 1
it 1
all 1
over 1
and 1
I 1
reckoned 1
I 1
would 1
walk 1
off 1
with 1
the 1
gun 1
and 1
some 1
lines 1
and 1
take 1
to 1
the 1
woods 1
when 1
I 1
run 1
away 1
I 1
guessed 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
stay 1
in 1
one 1
place 1
but 1
just 1
tramp 1
right 1
across 1
the 1
country 1
mostly 1
night 1
times 1
and 1
hunt 1
and 1
fish 1
to 1
keep 1
alive 1
and 1
so 1
get 1
so 1
far 1
away 1
that 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
nor 1
the 1
widow 1
couldn 1
t 1
ever 1
find 1
me 1
any 1
more 1
I 1
judged 1
I 1
would 1
saw 1
out 1
and 1
leave 1
that 1
night 1
if 1
pap 1
got 1
drunk 1
enough 1
and 1
I 1
reckoned 1
he 1
would 1
I 1
got 1
so 1
full 1
of 1
it 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
notice 1
how 1
long 1
I 1
was 1
staying 1
till 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
hollered 1
and 1
asked 1
me 1
whether 1
I 1
was 1
asleep 1
or 1
drownded 1
I 1
got 1
the 1
things 1
all 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
cabin 1
and 1
then 1
it 1
was 1
about 1
dark 1
While 1
I 1
was 1
cooking 1
supper 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
took 1
a 1
swig 1
or 1
two 1
and 1
got 1
sort 1
of 1
warmed 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
ripping 1
again 1
He 1
had 1
been 1
drunk 1
over 1
in 1
town 1
and 1
laid 1
in 1
the 1
gutter 1
all 1
night 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
sight 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
A 1
body 1
would 1
a 1
thought 1
he 1
was 1
Adam 1
he 1
was 1
just 1
all 1
mud 1
Whenever 1
his 1
liquor 1
begun 1
to 1
work 1
he 1
most 1
always 1
went 1
for 1
the 1
govment 1
this 1
time 1
he 1
says 1
Call 1
this 1
a 1
govment 1
why 1
just 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
see 1
what 1
it 1
s 1
like 1
Here 1
s 1
the 1
law 1

standing 1
ready 1

son 1
which 1
he 1
has 1

all 1
the 1
trouble 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
anxiety 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
expense 1
of 1
raising 1
Yes 1
just 1
as 1
that 1
man 1
has 1
got 1
that 1
son 1
raised 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
ready 1
to 1

him 1
and 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
rest 1
the 1
law 1
up 1
and 1
goes 1
for 1
him 1
And 1
they 1
call 1
that 1
govment 1
That 1
ain 1
t 1
all 1
nuther 1
The 1
law 1
backs 1
that 1
old 1
Judge 1
Thatcher 1
up 1
and 1
helps 1
him 1
to 1
keep 1
me 1
out 1
o 1
my 1
property 1
Here 1
s 1
what 1
the 1
law 1
does 1
The 1
law 1
takes 1
a 1
man 1
worth 1
six 1
thousand 1
dollars 1
and 1
up 1
ards 1
and 1
jams 1
him 1
into 1
an 1
old 1
trap 1
of 1
a 1
cabin 1
like 1
this 1
and 1
lets 1
him 1
go 1
round 1
in 1
clothes 1
that 1
ain 1
t 1
fitten 1
for 1
a 1
hog 1
They 1
call 1
that 1
govment 1
A 1
man 1
can 1
t 1
get 1
his 1
rights 1
in 1
a 1
govment 1
like 1
this 1
Sometimes 1
I 1
ve 1
a 1
mighty 1
notion 1
to 1
just 1
leave 1
the 1
country 1
for 1
good 1
and 1
all 1
Yes 1
and 1
I 1
told 1
em 1
so 1
I 1
told 1
old 1
Thatcher 1
so 1
to 1
his 1
face 1
Lots 1
of 1
em 1
heard 1
me 1
and 1
can 1
tell 1
what 1
I 1
said 1
Says 1
I 1
for 1
two 1
cents 1
I 1
d 1
leave 1
the 1
blamed 1
country 1
and 1
never 1
come 1
a 1
near 1
it 1
agin 1
Them 1
s 1
the 1
very 1
words 1
I 1
says 1
look 1
at 1
my 1
hat 1
if 1
you 1
call 1
it 1
a 1
hat 1
but 1
the 1
lid 1
raises 1
up 1
and 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
it 1
goes 1
down 1
till 1
it 1
s 1
below 1
my 1
chin 1
and 1
then 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
rightly 1
a 1
hat 1
at 1
all 1
but 1
more 1
like 1
my 1
head 1
was 1
shoved 1
up 1
through 1
a 1
jint 1
o 1
stove 1
pipe 1
Look 1
at 1
it 1
says 1
I 1
such 1
a 1
hat 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
wear 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
wealthiest 1
men 1
in 1
this 1
town 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
git 1
my 1
rights 1
Oh 1
yes 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
wonderful 1
govment 1
wonderful 1
Why 1
looky 1
here 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
free 1
nigger 1
there 1
from 1
Ohio 1
a 1
mulatter 1
most 1
as 1
white 1
as 1
a 1
white 1
man 1
He 1
had 1
the 1
whitest 1
shirt 1
on 1
you 1
ever 1
see 1
too 1
and 1
the 1
shiniest 1
hat 1
and 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
that 1
town 1
that 1
s 1
got 1
as 1
fine 1
clothes 1
as 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
gold 1
watch 1
and 1
chain 1
and 1
a 1
silver 1
headed 1
cane 1
the 1
awfulest 1
old 1
gray 1
headed 1
nabob 1
in 1
the 1
State 1
And 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
They 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
p 1
fessor 1
in 1
a 1
college 1
and 1
could 1
talk 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
languages 1
and 1
knowed 1
everything 1
And 1
that 1
ain 1
t 1
the 1
wust 1
They 1
said 1
he 1
could 1
vote 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
home 1
Well 1
that 1
let 1
me 1
out 1
Thinks 1
I 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
country 1
a 1
coming 1
to 1
It 1
was 1
lection 1
day 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
just 1
about 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
vote 1
myself 1
if 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
too 1
drunk 1
to 1
get 1
there 1
but 1
when 1
they 1
told 1
me 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
State 1
in 1
this 1
country 1
where 1
they 1
d 1
let 1
that 1
nigger 1
vote 1
I 1
drawed 1
out 1
I 1
says 1
I 1
ll 1
never 1
vote 1
agin 1
Them 1
s 1
the 1
very 1
words 1
I 1
said 1
they 1
all 1
heard 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
country 1
may 1
rot 1
for 1
all 1
me 1
I 1
ll 1
never 1
vote 1
agin 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
I 1
live 1
And 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
cool 1
way 1
of 1
that 1
nigger 1
why 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
a 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
road 1
if 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
shoved 1
him 1
out 1
o 1
the 1
way 1
I 1
says 1
to 1
the 1
people 1
why 1
ain 1
t 1
this 1
nigger 1
put 1
up 1
at 1
auction 1
and 1
sold 1
that 1
s 1
what 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
know 1
And 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
reckon 1
they 1
said 1
Why 1
they 1
said 1
he 1
couldn 1
t 1
be 1
sold 1
till 1
he 1
d 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
State 1
six 1
months 1
and 1
he 1
hadn 1
t 1
been 1
there 1
that 1
long 1
yet 1
There 1
now 1
that 1
s 1
a 1
specimen 1
They 1
call 1
that 1
a 1
govment 1
that 1
can 1
t 1
sell 1
a 1
free 1
nigger 1
till 1
he 1
s 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
State 1
six 1
months 1
Here 1
s 1
a 1
govment 1
that 1
calls 1
itself 1
a 1
govment 1
and 1
lets 1
on 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
govment 1
and 1
thinks 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
govment 1
and 1
yet 1
s 1
got 1
to 1
set 1
stock 1
still 1
for 1
six 1
whole 1
months 1
before 1
it 1
can 1
take 1
a 1
hold 1
of 1
a 1
prowling 1
thieving 1
infernal 1
white 1
shirted 1
free 1
nigger 1
and 1
Pap 1
was 1
agoing 1
on 1
so 1
he 1
never 1
noticed 1
where 1
his 1
old 1
limber 1
legs 1
was 1
taking 1
him 1
to 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
head 1
over 1
heels 1
over 1
the 1
tub 1
of 1
salt 1
pork 1
and 1
barked 1
both 1
shins 1
and 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
his 1
speech 1
was 1
all 1
the 1
hottest 1
kind 1
of 1
language 1
mostly 1
hove 1
at 1
the 1
nigger 1
and 1
the 1
govment 1
though 1
he 1
give 1
the 1
tub 1
some 1
too 1
all 1
along 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
He 1
hopped 1
around 1
the 1
cabin 1
considerable 1
first 1
on 1
one 1
leg 1
and 1
then 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
holding 1
first 1
one 1
shin 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
other 1
one 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
let 1
out 1
with 1
his 1
left 1
foot 1
all 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
and 1
fetched 1
the 1
tub 1
a 1
rattling 1
kick 1
But 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
good 1
judgment 1
because 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
boot 1
that 1
had 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
his 1
toes 1
leaking 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
front 1
end 1
of 1
it 1
so 1
now 1
he 1
raised 1
a 1
howl 1
that 1
fairly 1
made 1
a 1
body 1
s 1
hair 1
raise 1
and 1
down 1
he 1
went 1
in 1
the 1
dirt 1
and 1
rolled 1
there 1
and 1
held 1
his 1
toes 1
and 1
the 1
cussing 1
he 1
done 1
then 1
laid 1
over 1
anything 1
he 1
had 1
ever 1
done 1
previous 1
He 1
said 1
so 1
his 1
own 1
self 1
afterwards 1
He 1
had 1
heard 1
old 1
Sowberry 1
Hagan 1
in 1
his 1
best 1
days 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
laid 1
over 1
him 1
too 1
but 1
I 1
reckon 1
that 1
was 1
sort 1
of 1
piling 1
it 1
on 1
maybe 1
After 1
supper 1
pap 1
took 1
the 1
jug 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
had 1
enough 1
whisky 1
there 1
for 1
two 1
drunks 1
and 1
one 1
delirium 1
tremens 1
That 1
was 1
always 1
his 1
word 1
I 1
judged 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
blind 1
drunk 1
in 1
about 1
an 1
hour 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
would 1
steal 1
the 1
key 1
or 1
saw 1
myself 1
out 1
one 1
or 1
t 1
other 1
He 1
drank 1
and 1
drank 1
and 1
tumbled 1
down 1
on 1
his 1
blankets 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
but 1
luck 1
didn 1
t 1
run 1
my 1
way 1
He 1
didn 1
t 1
go 1
sound 1
asleep 1
but 1
was 1
uneasy 1
He 1
groaned 1
and 1
moaned 1
and 1
thrashed 1
around 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
that 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
At 1
last 1
I 1
got 1
so 1
sleepy 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
keep 1
my 1
eyes 1
open 1
all 1
I 1
could 1
do 1
and 1
so 1
before 1
I 1
knowed 1
what 1
I 1
was 1
about 1
I 1
was 1
sound 1
asleep 1
and 1
the 1
candle 1
burning 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
how 1
long 1
I 1
was 1
asleep 1
but 1
all 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
awful 1
scream 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
up 1
There 1
was 1
pap 1
looking 1
wild 1
and 1
skipping 1
around 1
every 1
which 1
way 1
and 1
yelling 1
about 1
snakes 1
He 1
said 1
they 1
was 1
crawling 1
up 1
his 1
legs 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
would 1
give 1
a 1
jump 1
and 1
scream 1
and 1
say 1
one 1
had 1
bit 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
cheek 1
but 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
no 1
snakes 1
He 1
started 1
and 1
run 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
the 1
cabin 1
hollering 1
Take 1
him 1
off 1
take 1
him 1
off 1
he 1
s 1
biting 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
neck 1
I 1
never 1
see 1
a 1
man 1
look 1
so 1
wild 1
in 1
the 1
eyes 1
Pretty 1
soon 1
he 1
was 1
all 1
fagged 1
out 1
and 1
fell 1
down 1
panting 1
then 1
he 1
rolled 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
wonderful 1
fast 1
kicking 1
things 1
every 1
which 1
way 1
and 1
striking 1
and 1
grabbing 1
at 1
the 1
air 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
screaming 1
and 1
saying 1
there 1
was 1
devils 1
a 1
hold 1
of 1
him 1
He 1
wore 1
out 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
laid 1
still 1
a 1
while 1
moaning 1
Then 1
he 1
laid 1
stiller 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
make 1
a 1
sound 1
I 1
could 1
hear 1
the 1
owls 1
and 1
the 1
wolves 1
away 1
off 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
terrible 1
still 1
He 1
was 1
laying 1
over 1
by 1
the 1
corner 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
he 1
raised 1
up 1
part 1
way 1
and 1
listened 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
He 1
says 1
very 1
low 1
Tramp 1
tramp 2
that 1
s 1
the 1
dead 1
tramp 3
they 1
re 1
coming 1
after 1
me 1
but 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
go 1
Oh 1
they 1
re 1
here 1
don 1
t 1
touch 1
me 1
don 1
t 1
hands 1
off 1
they 1
re 1
cold 1
let 1
go 1
Oh 1
let 1
a 1
poor 1
devil 1
alone 1
Then 1
he 1
went 1
down 1
on 1
all 1
fours 1
and 1
crawled 1
off 1
begging 1
them 1
to 1
let 1
him 1
alone 1
and 1
he 1
rolled 1
himself 1
up 1
in 1
his 1
blanket 1
and 1
wallowed 1
in 1
under 1
the 1
old 1
pine 1
table 1
still 1
a 1
begging 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
crying 1
I 1
could 1
hear 1
him 1
through 1
the 1
blanket 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
he 1
rolled 1
out 1
and 1
jumped 1
up 1
on 1
his 1
feet 1
looking 1
wild 1
and 1
he 1
see 1
me 1
and 1
went 1
for 1
me 1
He 1
chased 1
me 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
the 1
place 1
with 1
a 1
clasp 1
knife 1
calling 1
me 1
the 1
Angel 1
of 1
Death 1
and 1
saying 1
he 1
would 1
kill 1
me 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
come 1
for 1
him 1
no 1
more 1
I 1
begged 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
I 1
was 1
only 1
Huck 1
but 1
he 1
laughed 1
such 1
a 1
screechy 1
laugh 1
and 1
roared 1
and 1
cussed 1
and 1
kept 1
on 1
chasing 1
me 1
up 1
Once 1
when 1
I 1
turned 1
short 1
and 1
dodged 1
under 1
his 1
arm 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
grab 1
and 1
got 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
jacket 1
between 1
my 1
shoulders 1
and 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
was 1
gone 1
but 1
I 1
slid 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
jacket 1
quick 1
as 1
lightning 1
and 1
saved 1
myself 1
Pretty 1
soon 1
he 1
was 1
all 1
tired 1
out 1
and 1
dropped 1
down 1
with 1
his 1
back 1
against 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
rest 1
a 1
minute 1
and 1
then 1
kill 1
me 1
He 1
put 1
his 1
knife 1
under 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
sleep 1
and 1
get 1
strong 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
would 1
see 1
who 1
was 1
who 1
So 1
he 1
dozed 1
off 1
pretty 1
soon 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
I 1
got 1
the 1
old 1
split 1
bottom 1
chair 1
and 1
clumb 1
up 1
as 1
easy 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
to 1
make 1
any 1
noise 1
and 1
got 1
down 1
the 1
gun 1
I 1
slipped 1
the 1
ramrod 1
down 1
it 1
to 1
make 1
sure 1
it 1
was 1
loaded 1
then 1
I 1
laid 1
it 1
across 1
the 1
turnip 1
barrel 1
pointing 1
towards 1
pap 1
and 1
set 1
down 1
behind 1
it 1
to 1
wait 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
stir 1
And 1
how 1
slow 1
and 1
still 1
the 1
time 1
did 1
drag 1
along 1
CHAPTER 1
VII 1
GIT 1
up 1
What 1
you 1
bout 1
I 1
opened 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
looked 1
around 1
trying 1
to 1
make 1
out 1
where 1
I 1
was 1
It 1
was 1
after 1
sun 1
up 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
sound 1
asleep 1
Pap 1
was 1
standing 1
over 1
me 1
looking 1
sour 1
and 1
sick 1
too 1
He 1
says 1
What 1
you 1
doin 1
with 1
this 1
gun 1
I 1
judged 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
nothing 1
about 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
doing 1
so 1
I 1
says 1
Somebody 1
tried 1
to 1
get 1
in 1
so 1
I 1
was 1
laying 1
for 1
him 1
Why 1
didn 1
t 1
you 1
roust 1
me 1
out 1
Well 1
I 1
tried 1
to 1
but 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
budge 1
you 1
Well 1
all 1
right 1
Don 1
t 1
stand 1
there 1
palavering 1
all 1
day 1
but 1
out 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
see 1
if 1
there 1
s 1
a 1
fish 1
on 1
the 1
lines 1
for 1
breakfast 1
I 1
ll 1
be 1
along 1
in 1
a 1
minute 1
He 1
unlocked 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
I 1
cleared 1
out 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
bank 1
I 1
noticed 1
some 1
pieces 1
of 1
limbs 1
and 1
such 1
things 1
floating 1
down 1
and 1
a 1
sprinkling 1
of 1
bark 1
so 1
I 1
knowed 1
the 1
river 1
had 1
begun 1
to 1
rise 1
I 1
reckoned 1
I 1
would 1
have 1
great 1
times 1
now 1
if 1
I 1
was 1
over 1
at 1
the 1
town 1
The 1
June 1
rise 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
always 1
luck 1
for 1
me 1
because 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
that 1
rise 1
begins 1
here 1
comes 1
cordwood 1
floating 1
down 1
and 1
pieces 1
of 1
log 1
rafts 1
sometimes 1
a 1
dozen 1
logs 1
together 1
so 1
all 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
do 1
is 1
to 1
catch 1
them 1
and 1
sell 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
wood 1
yards 1
and 1
the 1
sawmill 1
I 1
went 1
along 1
up 1
the 1
bank 1
with 1
one 1
eye 1
out 1
for 1
pap 1
and 1
t 1
other 1
one 1
out 1
for 1
what 1
the 1
rise 1
might 1
fetch 1
along 1
Well 1
all 1
at 1
once 1
here 1
comes 1
a 1
canoe 1
just 1
a 1
beauty 1
too 1
about 1
thirteen 1
or 1
fourteen 1
foot 1
long 1
riding 1
high 1
like 1
a 1
duck 1
I 1
shot 1
head 1
first 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
bank 1
like 1
a 1
frog 1
clothes 1
and 1
all 1
on 1
and 1
struck 1
out 1
for 1
the 1
canoe 1
I 1
just 1
expected 1
there 1
d 1
be 1
somebody 1
laying 1
down 1
in 1
it 1
because 1
people 1
often 1
done 1
that 1
to 1
fool 1
folks 1
and 1
when 1
a 1
chap 1
had 1
pulled 1
a 1
skiff 1
out 1
most 1
to 1
it 1
they 1
d 1
raise 1
up 1
and 1
laugh 1
at 1
him 1
But 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
so 1
this 1
time 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
drift 1
canoe 1
sure 1
enough 1
and 1
I 1
clumb 1
in 1
and 1
paddled 1
her 1
ashore 1
Thinks 1
I 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
will 1
be 1
glad 1
when 1
he 1
sees 1
this 1
she 1
s 1
worth 1
ten 1
dollars 1
But 1
when 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
shore 1
pap 1
wasn 1
t 1
in 1
sight 1
yet 1
and 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
running 1
her 1
into 1
a 1
little 1
creek 1
like 1
a 1
gully 1
all 1
hung 1
over 1
with 1
vines 1
and 1
willows 1
I 1
struck 1
another 1
idea 1
I 1
judged 1
I 1
d 1
hide 1
her 1
good 1
and 1
then 1
stead 1
of 1
taking 1
to 1
the 1
woods 1
when 1
I 1
run 1
off 1
I 1
d 1
go 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
about 1
fifty 1
mile 1
and 1
camp 1
in 1
one 1
place 1
for 1
good 1
and 1
not 1
have 1
such 1
a 1
rough 1
time 1
tramping 1
on 1
foot 1
It 1
was 1
pretty 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
shanty 1
and 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
coming 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
but 1
I 1
got 1
her 1
hid 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
out 1
and 1
looked 1
around 1
a 1
bunch 1
of 1
willows 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
down 1
the 1
path 1
a 1
piece 1
just 1
drawing 1
a 1
bead 1
on 1
a 1
bird 1
with 1
his 1
gun 1
So 1
he 1
hadn 1
t 1
seen 1
anything 1
When 1
he 1
got 1
along 1
I 1
was 1
hard 1
at 1
it 1
taking 1
up 1
a 1
trot 1
line 1
He 1
abused 1
me 1
a 1
little 1
for 1
being 1
so 1
slow 1
but 1
I 1
told 1
him 1
I 1
fell 1
in 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
what 1
made 1
me 1
so 1
long 1
I 1
knowed 1
he 1
would 1
see 1
I 1
was 1
wet 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
asking 1
questions 1
We 1
got 1
five 1
catfish 1
off 1
the 1
lines 1
and 1
went 1
home 1
While 1
we 1
laid 1
off 1
after 1
breakfast 1
to 1
sleep 1
up 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
being 1
about 1
wore 1
out 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
thinking 1
that 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
fix 1
up 1
some 1
way 1
to 1
keep 1
pap 1
and 1
the 1
widow 1
from 1
trying 1
to 1
follow 1
me 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
certainer 1
thing 1
than 1
trusting 1
to 1
luck 1
to 1
get 1
far 1
enough 1
off 1
before 1
they 1
missed 1
me 1
you 1
see 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
things 1
might 1
happen 1
Well 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
see 1
no 1
way 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
but 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
pap 1
raised 1
up 1
a 1
minute 1
to 1
drink 1
another 1
barrel 1
of 1
water 1
and 1
he 1
says 1
Another 1
time 1
a 1
man 1
comes 1
a 1
prowling 1
round 1
here 1
you 1
roust 1
me 1
out 1
you 1
hear 1
That 1
man 1
warn 1
t 1
here 1
for 1
no 1
good 1
I 1
d 1
a 1
shot 1
him 1
Next 1
time 1
you 1
roust 1
me 1
out 1
you 1
hear 1
Then 1
he 1
dropped 1
down 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
sleep 1
again 1
but 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
saying 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
very 1
idea 1
I 1
wanted 1
I 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
I 1
can 1
fix 1
it 1
now 1
so 1
nobody 1
won 1
t 1
think 1
of 1
following 1
me 1
About 1
twelve 1
o 1
clock 1
we 1
turned 1
out 1
and 1
went 1
along 1
up 1
the 1
bank 1
The 1
river 1
was 1
coming 1
up 1
pretty 1
fast 1
and 1
lots 1
of 1
driftwood 1
going 1
by 1
on 1
the 1
rise 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
along 1
comes 1
part 1
of 1
a 1
log 1
raft 1
nine 1
logs 1
fast 1
together 1
We 1
went 1
out 1
with 1
the 1
skiff 1
and 1
towed 1
it 1
ashore 1
Then 1
we 1
had 1
dinner 1
Anybody 1
but 1
pap 1
would 1
a 1
waited 1
and 1
seen 1
the 1
day 1
through 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
catch 1
more 1
stuff 1
but 1
that 1
warn 1
t 1
pap 1
s 1
style 1
Nine 1
logs 1
was 1
enough 1
for 1
one 1
time 1
he 1
must 1
shove 1
right 1
over 1
to 1
town 1
and 1
sell 1
So 1
he 1
locked 1
me 1
in 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
skiff 1
and 1
started 1
off 1
towing 1
the 1
raft 1
about 1
half 1
past 1
three 1
I 1
judged 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
come 1
back 1
that 1
night 1
I 1
waited 1
till 1
I 1
reckoned 1
he 1
had 1
got 1
a 1
good 1
start 1
then 1
I 1
out 1
with 1
my 1
saw 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
work 1
on 1
that 1
log 1
again 1
Before 1
he 1
was 1
t 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
I 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
hole 1
him 1
and 1
his 1
raft 1
was 1
just 1
a 1
speck 1
on 1
the 1
water 1
away 1
off 1
yonder 1
I 1
took 1
the 1
sack 1
of 1
corn 1
meal 1
and 1
took 1
it 1
to 1
where 1
the 1
canoe 1
was 1
hid 1
and 1
shoved 1
the 1
vines 1
and 1
branches 1
apart 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
in 1
then 1
I 1
done 1
the 1
same 1
with 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
bacon 1
then 1
the 1
whisky 1
jug 1
I 1
took 1
all 1
the 1
coffee 1
and 1
sugar 1
there 1
was 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
ammunition 1
I 1
took 1
the 1
wadding 1
I 1
took 1
the 1
bucket 1
and 1
gourd 1
I 1
took 1
a 1
dipper 1
and 1
a 1
tin 1
cup 1
and 1
my 1
old 1
saw 1
and 1
two 1
blankets 1
and 1
the 1
skillet 1
and 1
the 1
coffee 1
pot 1
I 1
took 1
fish 1
lines 1
and 1
matches 1
and 1
other 1
things 1
everything 1
that 1
was 1
worth 1
a 1
cent 1
I 1
cleaned 1
out 1
the 1
place 1
I 1
wanted 1
an 1
axe 1
but 1
there 1
wasn 1
t 1
any 1
only 1
the 1
one 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
woodpile 1
and 1
I 1
knowed 1
why 1
I 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
leave 1
that 1
I 1
fetched 1
out 1
the 1
gun 1
and 1
now 1
I 1
was 1
done 1
I 1
had 1
wore 1
the 1
ground 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
crawling 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
hole 1
and 1
dragging 1
out 1
so 1
many 1
things 1
So 1
I 1
fixed 1
that 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
from 1
the 1
outside 1
by 1
scattering 1
dust 1
on 1
the 1
place 1
which 1
covered 1
up 1
the 1
smoothness 1
and 1
the 1
sawdust 1
Then 1
I 1
fixed 1
the 1
piece 1
of 1
log 1
back 1
into 1
its 1
place 1
and 1
put 1
two 1
rocks 1
under 1
it 1
and 1
one 1
against 1
it 1
to 1
hold 1
it 1
there 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
bent 1
up 1
at 1
that 1
place 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
quite 1
touch 1
ground 1
If 1
you 1
stood 1
four 1
or 1
five 1
foot 1
away 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
it 1
was 1
sawed 1
you 1
wouldn 1
t 1
never 1
notice 1
it 1
and 1
besides 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
cabin 1
and 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
likely 1
anybody 1
would 1
go 1
fooling 1
around 1
there 1
It 1
was 1
all 1
grass 1
clear 1
to 1
the 1
canoe 1
so 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
left 1
a 1
track 1
I 1
followed 1
around 1
to 1
see 1
I 1
stood 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
and 1
looked 1
out 1
over 1
the 1
river 1
All 1
safe 1
So 1
I 1
took 1
the 1
gun 1
and 1
went 1
up 1
a 1
piece 1
into 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
was 1
hunting 1
around 1
for 1
some 1
birds 1
when 1
I 1
see 1
a 1
wild 1
pig 1
hogs 1
soon 1
went 1
wild 1
in 1
them 1
bottoms 1
after 1
they 1
had 1
got 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
prairie 1
farms 1
I 1
shot 1
this 1
fellow 1
and 1
took 1
him 1
into 1
camp 1
I 1
took 1
the 1
axe 1
and 1
smashed 1
in 1
the 1
door 1
I 1
beat 1
it 1
and 1
hacked 1
it 1
considerable 1
a 1
doing 1
it 1
I 1
fetched 1
the 1
pig 1
in 1
and 1
took 1
him 1
back 1
nearly 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
hacked 1
into 1
his 1
throat 1
with 1
the 1
axe 1
and 1
laid 1
him 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
to 1
bleed 1
I 1
say 1
ground 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
ground 1
hard 1
packed 1
and 1
no 1
boards 1
Well 1
next 1
I 1
took 1
an 1
old 1
sack 1
and 1
put 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
big 1
rocks 1
in 1
it 1
all 1
I 1
could 1
drag 1
and 1
I 1
started 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
pig 1
and 1
dragged 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
dumped 1
it 1
in 1
and 1
down 1
it 1
sunk 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
You 1
could 1
easy 1
see 1
that 1
something 1
had 1
been 1
dragged 1
over 1
the 1
ground 1
I 1
did 1
wish 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
was 1
there 1
I 1
knowed 1
he 1
would 1
take 1
an 1
interest 1
in 1
this 1
kind 1
of 1
business 1
and 1
throw 1
in 1
the 1
fancy 1
touches 1
Nobody 1
could 1
spread 1
himself 1
like 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
thing 1
as 1
that 1
Well 1
last 1
I 1
pulled 1
out 1
some 1
of 1
my 1
hair 1
and 1
blooded 1
the 1
axe 1
good 1
and 1
stuck 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
back 1
side 1
and 1
slung 1
the 1
axe 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
Then 1
I 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
pig 1
and 1
held 1
him 1
to 1
my 1
breast 1
with 1
my 1
jacket 1
so 1
he 1
couldn 1
t 1
drip 1
till 1
I 1
got 1
a 1
good 1
piece 1
below 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
then 1
dumped 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
river 1
Now 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
something 1
else 1
So 1
I 1
went 1
and 1
got 1
the 1
bag 1
of 1
meal 1
and 1
my 1
old 1
saw 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
fetched 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
I 1
took 1
the 1
bag 1
to 1
where 1
it 1
used 1
to 1
stand 1
and 1
ripped 1
a 1
hole 1
in 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
the 1
saw 1
for 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
knives 1
and 1
forks 1
on 1
the 1
place 1
pap 1
done 1
everything 1
with 1
his 1
clasp 1
knife 1
about 1
the 1
cooking 1
Then 1
I 1
carried 1
the 1
sack 1
about 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
across 1
the 1
grass 1
and 1
through 1
the 1
willows 1
east 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
to 1
a 1
shallow 1
lake 1
that 1
was 1
five 1
mile 1
wide 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
rushes 1
and 1
ducks 1
too 1
you 1
might 1
say 1
in 1
the 1
season 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
slough 1
or 1
a 1
creek 1
leading 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
that 1
went 1
miles 1
away 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
where 1
but 1
it 1
didn 1
t 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
river 1
The 1
meal 1
sifted 1
out 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
little 1
track 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
lake 1
I 1
dropped 1
pap 1
s 1
whetstone 1
there 1
too 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
look 1
like 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
done 1
by 1
accident 1
Then 1
I 1
tied 1
up 1
the 1
rip 1
in 1
the 1
meal 1
sack 1
with 1
a 1
string 1
so 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
leak 1
no 1
more 1
and 1
took 1
it 1
and 1
my 1
saw 1
to 1
the 1
canoe 1
again 1
It 1
was 1
about 1
dark 1
now 1
so 1
I 1
dropped 1
the 1
canoe 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
under 1
some 1
willows 1
that 1
hung 1
over 1
the 1
bank 1
and 1
waited 1
for 1
the 1
moon 1
to 1
rise 1
I 1
made 1
fast 1
to 1
a 1
willow 1
then 1
I 1
took 1
a 1
bite 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
laid 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
to 1
smoke 1
a 1
pipe 1
and 1
lay 1
out 1
a 1
plan 1
I 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
they 1
ll 1
follow 1
the 1
track 1
of 1
that 1
sackful 1
of 1
rocks 1
to 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
then 1
drag 1
the 1
river 1
for 1
me 1
And 1
they 1
ll 1
follow 1
that 1
meal 1
track 1
to 1
the 1
lake 1
and 1
go 1
browsing 1
down 1
the 1
creek 1
that 1
leads 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
robbers 1
that 1
killed 1
me 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
things 1
They 1
won 1
t 1
ever 1
hunt 1
the 1
river 1
for 1
anything 1
but 1
my 1
dead 1
carcass 1
They 1
ll 1
soon 1
get 1
tired 1
of 1
that 1
and 1
won 1
t 1
bother 1
no 1
more 1
about 1
me 1
All 1
right 1
I 1
can 1
stop 1
anywhere 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
Jackson 1
s 1
Island 1
is 1
good 1
enough 1
for 1
me 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
island 1
pretty 1
well 1
and 1
nobody 1
ever 1
comes 1
there 1
And 1
then 1
I 1
can 1
paddle 1
over 1
to 1
town 1
nights 1
and 1
slink 1
around 1
and 1
pick 1
up 1
things 1
I 1
want 1
Jackson 1
s 1
Island 1
s 1
the 1
place 1
I 1
was 1
pretty 1
tired 1
and 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
I 1
knowed 1
I 1
was 1
asleep 1
When 1
I 1
woke 1
up 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
where 1
I 1
was 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
I 1
set 1
up 1
and 1
looked 1
around 1
a 1
little 1
scared 1
Then 1
I 1
remembered 1
The 1
river 1
looked 1
miles 1
and 1
miles 1
across 1
The 1
moon 1
was 1
so 1
bright 1
I 1
could 1
a 1
counted 1
the 1
drift 1
logs 1
that 1
went 1
a 1
slipping 1
along 1
black 1
and 1
still 1
hundreds 1
of 1
yards 1
out 1
from 1
shore 1
Everything 1
was 1
dead 1
quiet 1
and 1
it 1
looked 1
late 1
and 1
smelt 1
late 1
You 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
mean 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
the 1
words 1
to 1
put 1
it 1
in 1
I 1
took 1
a 1
good 1
gap 1
and 1
a 1
stretch 1
and 1
was 1
just 1
going 1
to 1
unhitch 1
and 1
start 1
when 1
I 1
heard 1
a 1
sound 1
away 1
over 1
the 1
water 1
I 1
listened 1
Pretty 1
soon 1
I 1
made 1
it 1
out 1
It 1
was 1
that 1
dull 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
regular 1
sound 1
that 1
comes 1
from 1
oars 1
working 1
in 1
rowlocks 1
when 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
still 1
night 1
I 1
peeped 1
out 1
through 1
the 1
willow 1
branches 1
and 1
there 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
skiff 1
away 1
across 1
the 1
water 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
tell 1
how 1
many 1
was 1
in 1
it 1
It 1
kept 1
a 1
coming 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
abreast 1
of 1
me 1
I 1
see 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
but 1
one 1
man 1
in 1
it 1
Think 1
s 1
I 1
maybe 1
it 1
s 1
pap 1
though 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
expecting 1
him 1
He 1
dropped 1
below 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
current 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
he 1
came 1
a 1
swinging 1
up 1
shore 1
in 1
the 1
easy 1
water 1
and 1
he 1
went 1
by 1
so 1
close 1
I 1
could 1
a 1
reached 1
out 1
the 1
gun 1
and 1
touched 1
him 1
Well 1
it 1
was 1
pap 1
sure 1
enough 1
and 1
sober 1
too 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
laid 1
his 1
oars 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
lose 1
no 1
time 1
The 1
next 1
minute 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
spinning 1
down 1
stream 1
soft 1
but 1
quick 1
in 1
the 1
shade 1
of 1
the 1
bank 1
I 1
made 1
two 1
mile 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
and 1
then 1
struck 1
out 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
or 1
more 1
towards 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
because 1
pretty 1
soon 1
I 1
would 1
be 1
passing 1
the 1
ferry 1
landing 1
and 1
people 1
might 1
see 1
me 1
and 1
hail 1
me 1
I 1
got 1
out 1
amongst 1
the 1
driftwood 1
and 1
then 1
laid 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
let 1
her 1
float 1
I 1
laid 1
there 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
rest 1
and 1
a 1
smoke 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
pipe 1
looking 1
away 1
into 1
the 1
sky 1
not 1
a 1
cloud 1
in 1
it 1
The 1
sky 1
looks 1
ever 1
so 1
deep 1
when 1
you 1
lay 1
down 1
on 1
your 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
moonshine 1
I 1
never 1
knowed 1
it 1
before 1
And 1
how 1
far 1
a 1
body 1
can 1
hear 1
on 1
the 1
water 1
such 1
nights 1
I 1
heard 1
people 1
talking 1
at 1
the 1
ferry 1
landing 1
I 1
heard 1
what 1
they 1
said 1
too 1
every 1
word 1
of 1
it 1
One 1
man 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
getting 1
towards 1
the 1
long 1
days 1
and 1
the 1
short 1
nights 1
now 1
T 1
other 1
one 1
said 1
this 1
warn 1
t 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
short 1
ones 1
he 1
reckoned 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
laughed 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
over 1
again 1
and 1
they 1
laughed 1
again 1
then 1
they 1
waked 1
up 1
another 1
fellow 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
and 1
laughed 1
but 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
laugh 1
he 1
ripped 1
out 1
something 1
brisk 1
and 1
said 1
let 1
him 1
alone 1
The 1
first 1
fellow 1
said 1
he 1
lowed 1
to 1
tell 1
it 1
to 1
his 1
old 1
woman 1
she 1
would 1
think 1
it 1
was 1
pretty 1
good 1
but 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
warn 1
t 1
nothing 1
to 1
some 1
things 1
he 1
had 1
said 1
in 1
his 1
time 1
I 1
heard 1
one 1
man 1
say 1
it 1
was 1
nearly 1
three 1
o 1
clock 1
and 1
he 1
hoped 1
daylight 1
wouldn 1
t 1
wait 1
more 1
than 1
about 1
a 1
week 1
longer 1
After 1
that 1
the 1
talk 1
got 1
further 1
and 1
further 1
away 1
and 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
make 1
out 1
the 1
words 1
any 1
more 1
but 1
I 1
could 1
hear 1
the 1
mumble 1
and 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
laugh 1
too 1
but 1
it 1
seemed 1
a 1
long 1
ways 1
off 1
I 1
was 1
away 1
below 1
the 1
ferry 1
now 1
I 1
rose 1
up 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
Jackson 1
s 1
Island 1
about 1
two 1
mile 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
down 1
stream 1
heavy 1
timbered 1
and 1
standing 1
up 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
big 1
and 1
dark 1
and 1
solid 1
like 1
a 1
steamboat 1
without 1
any 1
lights 1
There 1
warn 1
t 1
any 1
signs 1
of 1
the 1
bar 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
under 1
water 1
now 1
It 1
didn 1
t 1
take 1
me 1
long 1
to 1
get 1
there 1
I 1
shot 1
past 1
the 1
head 1
at 1
a 1
ripping 1
rate 1
the 1
current 1
was 1
so 1
swift 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
dead 1
water 1
and 1
landed 1
on 1
the 1
side 1
towards 1
the 1
Illinois 1
shore 1
I 1
run 1
the 1
canoe 1
into 1
a 1
deep 1
dent 1
in 1
the 1
bank 1
that 1
I 1
knowed 1
about 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
part 1
the 1
willow 1
branches 1
to 1
get 1
in 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
made 1
fast 1
nobody 1
could 1
a 1
seen 1
the 1
canoe 1
from 1
the 1
outside 1
I 1
went 1
up 1
and 1
set 1
down 1
on 1
a 1
log 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
and 1
looked 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
big 1
river 1
and 1
the 1
black 1
driftwood 1
and 1
away 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
town 1
three 1
mile 1
away 1
where 1
there 1
was 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
lights 1
twinkling 1
A 1
monstrous 1
big 1
lumber 1
raft 1
was 1
about 1
a 1
mile 1
up 1
stream 1
coming 1
along 1
down 1
with 1
a 1
lantern 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
it 1
I 1
watched 1
it 1
come 1
creeping 1
down 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
most 1
abreast 1
of 1
where 1
I 1
stood 1
I 1
heard 1
a 1
man 1
say 1
Stern 1
oars 1
there 1
heave 1
her 1
head 1
to 1
stabboard 1
I 1
heard 1
that 1
just 1
as 1
plain 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
by 1
my 1
side 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
gray 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
now 1
so 1
I 1
stepped 1
into 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
laid 1
down 1
for 1
a 1
nap 1
before 1
breakfast 1
CHAPTER 1
VIII 1
THE 1
sun 1
was 1
up 1
so 1
high 1
when 1
I 1
waked 1
that 1
I 1
judged 1
it 1
was 1
after 1
eight 1
o 1
clock 1
I 1
laid 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
grass 1
and 1
the 1
cool 1
shade 1
thinking 1
about 1
things 1
and 1
feeling 1
rested 1
and 1
ruther 1
comfortable 1
and 1
satisfied 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
sun 1
out 1
at 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
holes 1
but 1
mostly 1
it 1
was 1
big 1
trees 1
all 1
about 1
and 1
gloomy 1
in 1
there 1
amongst 1
them 1
There 1
was 1
freckled 1
places 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
where 1
the 1
light 1
sifted 1
down 1
through 1
the 1
leaves 1
and 1
the 1
freckled 1
places 1
swapped 1
about 1
a 1
little 1
showing 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
breeze 1
up 1
there 1
A 1
couple 1
of 1
squirrels 1
set 1
on 1
a 1
limb 1
and 1
jabbered 1
at 1
me 1
very 1
friendly 1
I 1
was 1
powerful 1
lazy 1
and 1
comfortable 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
and 1
cook 1
breakfast 1
Well 1
I 1
was 1
dozing 1
off 1
again 1
when 1
I 1
thinks 1
I 1
hears 1
a 1
deep 1
sound 1
of 1
boom 1
away 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
I 1
rouses 1
up 1
and 1
rests 1
on 1
my 1
elbow 1
and 1
listens 1
pretty 1
soon 1
I 1
hears 1
it 1
again 1
I 1
hopped 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
and 1
looked 1
out 1
at 1
a 1
hole 1
in 1
the 1
leaves 1
and 1
I 1
see 1
a 1
bunch 1
of 1
smoke 1
laying 1
on 1
the 1
water 1
a 1
long 1
ways 1
up 1
about 1
abreast 1
the 1
ferry 1
And 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
full 1
of 1
people 1
floating 1
along 1
down 1
I 1
knowed 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
matter 1
now 1
Boom 1
I 1
see 1
the 1
white 1
smoke 1
squirt 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
s 1
side 1
You 1
see 1
they 1
was 1
firing 1
cannon 1
over 1
the 1
water 1
trying 1
to 1
make 1
my 1
carcass 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
I 1
was 1
pretty 1
hungry 1
but 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
start 1
a 1
fire 1
because 1
they 1
might 1
see 1
the 1
smoke 1
So 1
I 1
set 1
there 1
and 1
watched 1
the 1
cannon 1
smoke 1
and 1
listened 1
to 1
the 1
boom 1
The 1
river 1
was 1
a 1
mile 1
wide 1
there 1
and 1
it 1
always 1
looks 1
pretty 1
on 1
a 1
summer 1
morning 1
so 1
I 1
was 1
having 1
a 1
good 1
enough 1
time 1
seeing 1
them 1
hunt 1
for 1
my 1
remainders 1
if 1
I 1
only 1
had 1
a 1
bite 1
to 1
eat 1
Well 1
then 1
I 1
happened 1
to 1
think 1
how 1
they 1
always 1
put 1
quicksilver 1
in 1
loaves 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
float 1
them 1
off 1
because 1
they 1
always 1
go 1
right 1
to 1
the 1
drownded 1
carcass 1
and 1
stop 1
there 1
So 1
says 1
I 2
ll 1
keep 1
a 1
lookout 1
and 1
if 1
any 1
of 1
them 1
s 1
floating 1
around 1
after 1
me 1
I 1
ll 1
give 1
them 1
a 1
show 1
I 1
changed 1
to 1
the 1
Illinois 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
luck 1
I 1
could 1
have 1
and 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
disappointed 1
A 1
big 1
double 1
loaf 1
come 1
along 1
and 1
I 1
most 1
got 1
it 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
stick 1
but 1
my 1
foot 1
slipped 1
and 1
she 1
floated 1
out 1
further 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
was 1
where 1
the 1
current 1
set 1
in 1
the 1
closest 1
to 1
the 1
shore 1
I 1
knowed 1
enough 1
for 1
that 1
But 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
along 1
comes 1
another 1
one 1
and 1
this 1
time 1
I 1
won 1
I 1
took 1
out 1
the 1
plug 1
and 1
shook 1
out 1
the 1
little 1
dab 1
of 1
quicksilver 1
and 1
set 1
my 1
teeth 1
in 1
It 1
was 1
baker 1
s 1
bread 1
what 1
the 1
quality 1
eat 1
none 1
of 1
your 1
low 1
down 1
corn 1
pone 1
I 1
got 1
a 1
good 1
place 1
amongst 1
the 1
leaves 1
and 1
set 1
there 1
on 1
a 1
log 1
munching 1
the 1
bread 1
and 1
watching 1
the 1
ferry 1
boat 1
and 1
very 1
well 1
satisfied 1
And 1
then 1
something 1
struck 1
me 1
I 1
says 1
now 1
I 1
reckon 1
the 1
widow 1
or 1
the 1
parson 1
or 1
somebody 1
prayed 1
that 1
this 1
bread 1
would 1
find 1
me 1
and 1
here 1
it 1
has 1
gone 1
and 1
done 1
it 1
So 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
doubt 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
something 1
in 1
that 1
thing 1
that 1
is 1
there 1
s 1
something 1
in 1
it 1
when 1
a 1
body 1
like 1
the 1
widow 1
or 1
the 1
parson 1
prays 1
but 1
it 1
don 1
t 1
work 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
reckon 1
it 1
don 1
t 1
work 1
for 1
only 1
just 1
the 1
right 1
kind 1
I 1
lit 1
a 1
pipe 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
long 1
smoke 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
watching 1
The 1
ferryboat 1
was 1
floating 1
with 1
the 1
current 1
and 1
I 1
allowed 1
I 1
d 1
have 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
see 1
who 1
was 1
aboard 1
when 1
she 1
come 1
along 1
because 1
she 1
would 1
come 1
in 1
close 1
where 1
the 1
bread 1
did 1
When 1
she 1
d 1
got 1
pretty 1
well 1
along 1
down 1
towards 1
me 1
I 1
put 1
out 1
my 1
pipe 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
where 1
I 1
fished 1
out 1
the 1
bread 1
and 1
laid 1
down 1
behind 1
a 1
log 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
open 1
place 1
Where 1
the 1
log 1
forked 1
I 1
could 1
peep 1
through 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
she 1
come 1
along 1
and 1
she 1
drifted 1
in 1
so 1
close 1
that 1
they 1
could 1
a 1
run 1
out 1
a 1
plank 1
and 1
walked 1
ashore 1
Most 1
everybody 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
boat 1
Pap 1
and 1
Judge 1
Thatcher 1
and 1
Bessie 1
Thatcher 1
and 1
Jo 1
Harper 1
and 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
and 1
his 1
old 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
and 1
Sid 1
and 1
Mary 1
and 1
plenty 1
more 1
Everybody 1
was 1
talking 1
about 1
the 1
murder 1
but 1
the 1
captain 1
broke 1
in 1
and 1
says 1
Look 1
sharp 1
now 1
the 1
current 1
sets 1
in 1
the 1
closest 1
here 1
and 1
maybe 1
he 1
s 1
washed 1
ashore 1
and 1
got 1
tangled 1
amongst 1
the 1
brush 1
at 1
the 1
water 1
s 1
edge 1
I 1
hope 1
so 1
anyway 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
hope 1
so 1
They 1
all 1
crowded 1
up 1
and 1
leaned 1
over 1
the 1
rails 1
nearly 1
in 1
my 1
face 1
and 1
kept 1
still 1
watching 1
with 1
all 1
their 1
might 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
them 1
first 1
rate 1
but 1
they 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
me 1
Then 1
the 1
captain 1
sung 1
out 1
Stand 1
away 1
and 1
the 1
cannon 1
let 1
off 1
such 1
a 1
blast 1
right 1
before 1
me 1
that 1
it 1
made 1
me 1
deef 1
with 1
the 1
noise 1
and 1
pretty 1
near 1
blind 1
with 1
the 1
smoke 1
and 1
I 1
judged 1
I 1
was 1
gone 1
If 1
they 1
d 1
a 1
had 1
some 1
bullets 1
in 1
I 1
reckon 1
they 1
d 1
a 1
got 1
the 1
corpse 1
they 1
was 1
after 1
Well 1
I 1
see 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
hurt 1
thanks 1
to 1
goodness 1
The 1
boat 1
floated 1
on 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
around 1
the 1
shoulder 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
I 1
could 1
hear 1
the 1
booming 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
further 1
and 1
further 1
off 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
after 1
an 1
hour 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
hear 1
it 1
no 1
more 1
The 1
island 1
was 1
three 1
mile 1
long 1
I 1
judged 1
they 1
had 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
foot 1
and 1
was 1
giving 1
it 1
up 1
But 1
they 1
didn 1
t 1
yet 1
a 1
while 1
They 1
turned 1
around 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
and 1
started 1
up 1
the 1
channel 1
on 1
the 1
Missouri 1
side 1
under 1
steam 1
and 1
booming 1
once 1
in 1
a 1
while 1
as 1
they 1
went 1
I 1
crossed 1
over 1
to 1
that 1
side 1
and 1
watched 1
them 1
When 1
they 1
got 1
abreast 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
they 1
quit 1
shooting 1
and 1
dropped 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
Missouri 1
shore 1
and 1
went 1
home 1
to 1
the 1
town 1
I 1
knowed 1
I 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
now 1
Nobody 1
else 1
would 1
come 1
a 1
hunting 1
after 1
me 1
I 1
got 1
my 1
traps 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
made 1
me 1
a 1
nice 1
camp 1
in 1
the 1
thick 1
woods 1
I 1
made 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
tent 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
blankets 1
to 1
put 1
my 1
things 1
under 1
so 1
the 1
rain 1
couldn 1
t 1
get 1
at 1
them 1
I 1
catched 1
a 1
catfish 1
and 1
haggled 1
him 1
open 1
with 1
my 1
saw 1
and 1
towards 1
sundown 1
I 1
started 1
my 1
camp 1
fire 1
and 1
had 1
supper 1
Then 1
I 1
set 1
out 1
a 1
line 1
to 1
catch 1
some 1
fish 1
for 1
breakfast 1
When 1
it 1
was 1
dark 1
I 1
set 1
by 1
my 1
camp 1
fire 1
smoking 1
and 1
feeling 1
pretty 1
well 1
satisfied 1
but 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
it 1
got 1
sort 1
of 1
lonesome 1
and 1
so 1
I 1
went 1
and 1
set 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
and 1
listened 1
to 1
the 1
current 1
swashing 1
along 1
and 1
counted 1
the 1
stars 1
and 1
drift 1
logs 1
and 1
rafts 1
that 1
come 1
down 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
better 1
way 1
to 1
put 1
in 1
time 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
lonesome 1
you 1
can 1
t 1
stay 1
so 1
you 1
soon 1
get 1
over 1
it 1
And 1
so 1
for 1
three 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
No 1
difference 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
But 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
I 1
went 1
exploring 1
around 1
down 1
through 1
the 1
island 1
I 1
was 1
boss 1
of 1
it 2
all 1
belonged 1
to 1
me 1
so 1
to 1
say 1
and 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
but 1
mainly 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
put 1
in 1
the 1
time 1
I 1
found 1
plenty 1
strawberries 1
ripe 1
and 1
prime 1
and 1
green 1
summer 1
grapes 1
and 1
green 1
razberries 1
and 1
the 1
green 1
blackberries 1
was 1
just 1
beginning 1
to 1
show 1
They 1
would 1
all 1
come 1
handy 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
I 1
judged 1
Well 1
I 1
went 1
fooling 1
along 1
in 1
the 1
deep 1
woods 1
till 1
I 1
judged 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
I 1
had 1
my 1
gun 1
along 1
but 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
shot 1
nothing 1
it 1
was 1
for 1
protection 1
thought 1
I 1
would 1
kill 1
some 1
game 1
nigh 1
home 1
About 1
this 1
time 1
I 1
mighty 1
near 1
stepped 1
on 1
a 1
good 1
sized 1
snake 1
and 1
it 1
went 1
sliding 1
off 1
through 1
the 1
grass 1
and 1
flowers 1
and 1
I 1
after 1
it 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
shot 1
at 1
it 1
I 1
clipped 1
along 1
and 1
all 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
I 1
bounded 1
right 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
ashes 1
of 1
a 1
camp 1
fire 1
that 1
was 1
still 1
smoking 1
My 1
heart 1
jumped 1
up 1
amongst 1
my 1
lungs 1
I 1
never 1
waited 1
for 1
to 1
look 1
further 1
but 1
uncocked 1
my 1
gun 1
and 1
went 1
sneaking 1
back 1
on 1
my 1
tiptoes 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
ever 1
I 1
could 1
Every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
stopped 1
a 1
second 1
amongst 1
the 1
thick 1
leaves 1
and 1
listened 1
but 1
my 1
breath 1
come 1
so 1
hard 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
hear 1
nothing 1
else 1
I 1
slunk 1
along 1
another 1
piece 1
further 1
then 1
listened 1
again 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
If 1
I 1
see 1
a 1
stump 1
I 1
took 1
it 1
for 1
a 1
man 1
if 1
I 1
trod 1
on 1
a 1
stick 1
and 1
broke 1
it 2
made 1
me 1
feel 1
like 1
a 1
person 1
had 1
cut 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
breaths 1
in 1
two 1
and 1
I 1
only 1
got 1
half 1
and 1
the 1
short 1
half 1
too 1
When 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
camp 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
feeling 1
very 1
brash 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
much 1
sand 1
in 1
my 1
craw 1
but 1
I 1
says 1
this 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
be 1
fooling 1
around 1
So 1
I 1
got 1
all 1
my 1
traps 1
into 1
my 1
canoe 1
again 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
have 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
and 1
I 1
put 1
out 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
scattered 1
the 1
ashes 1
around 1
to 1
look 1
like 1
an 1
old 1
last 1
year 1
s 1
camp 1
and 1
then 1
clumb 1
a 1
tree 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
was 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
tree 1
two 1
hours 1
but 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
see 1
nothing 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
hear 1
nothing 1
I 1
only 1
thought 1
I 1
heard 1
and 1
seen 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
a 1
thousand 1
things 1
Well 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
stay 1
up 1
there 1
forever 1
so 1
at 1
last 1
I 1
got 1
down 1
but 1
I 1
kept 1
in 1
the 1
thick 1
woods 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
lookout 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
All 1
I 1
could 1
get 1
to 1
eat 1
was 1
berries 1
and 1
what 1
was 1
left 1
over 1
from 1
breakfast 1
By 1
the 1
time 1
it 1
was 1
night 1
I 1
was 1
pretty 1
hungry 1
So 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
good 1
and 1
dark 1
I 1
slid 1
out 1
from 1
shore 1
before 1
moonrise 1
and 1
paddled 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
Illinois 1
bank 1
about 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
I 1
went 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
cooked 1
a 1
supper 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
about 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
I 1
would 1
stay 1
there 1
all 1
night 1
when 1
I 1
hear 1
a 1
plunkety 1
plunk 1
plunkety 1
plunk 1
and 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
horses 1
coming 1
and 1
next 1
I 1
hear 1
people 1
s 1
voices 1
I 1
got 1
everything 1
into 1
the 1
canoe 1
as 1
quick 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
creeping 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
I 1
could 1
find 1
out 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
got 1
far 1
when 1
I 1
hear 1
a 1
man 1
say 1
We 1
better 1
camp 1
here 1
if 1
we 1
can 1
find 1
a 1
good 1
place 1
the 1
horses 1
is 1
about 1
beat 1
out 1
Let 1
s 1
look 1
around 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
wait 1
but 1
shoved 1
out 1
and 1
paddled 1
away 1
easy 1
I 1
tied 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
place 1
and 1
reckoned 1
I 1
would 1
sleep 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
sleep 1
much 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
somehow 1
for 1
thinking 1
And 1
every 1
time 1
I 1
waked 1
up 1
I 1
thought 1
somebody 1
had 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
neck 1
So 1
the 1
sleep 1
didn 1
t 1
do 1
me 1
no 1
good 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
I 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
live 1
this 1
way 1
I 1
m 1
a 1
going 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
who 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
s 1
here 1
on 1
the 1
island 1
with 1
me 1
I 1
ll 1
find 1
it 1
out 1
or 1
bust 1
Well 1
I 1
felt 1
better 1
right 1
off 1
So 1
I 1
took 1
my 1
paddle 1
and 1
slid 1
out 1
from 1
shore 1
just 1
a 1
step 1
or 1
two 1
and 1
then 1
let 1
the 1
canoe 1
drop 1
along 1
down 1
amongst 1
the 1
shadows 1
The 1
moon 1
was 1
shining 1
and 1
outside 1
of 1
the 1
shadows 1
it 1
made 1
it 1
most 1
as 1
light 1
as 1
day 1
I 1
poked 1
along 1
well 1
on 1
to 1
an 1
hour 1
everything 1
still 1
as 1
rocks 1
and 1
sound 1
asleep 1
Well 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
I 1
was 1
most 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
A 1
little 1
ripply 1
cool 1
breeze 1
begun 1
to 1
blow 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
saying 1
the 1
night 1
was 1
about 1
done 1
I 1
give 1
her 1
a 1
turn 1
with 1
the 1
paddle 1
and 1
brung 1
her 1
nose 1
to 1
shore 1
then 1
I 1
got 1
my 1
gun 1
and 1
slipped 1
out 1
and 1
into 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
I 1
sat 1
down 1
there 1
on 1
a 1
log 1
and 1
looked 1
out 1
through 1
the 1
leaves 1
I 1
see 1
the 1
moon 1
go 1
off 1
watch 1
and 1
the 1
darkness 1
begin 1
to 1
blanket 1
the 1
river 1
But 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
I 1
see 1
a 1
pale 1
streak 1
over 1
the 1
treetops 1
and 1
knowed 1
the 1
day 1
was 1
coming 1
So 1
I 1
took 1
my 1
gun 1
and 1
slipped 1
off 1
towards 1
where 1
I 1
had 1
run 1
across 1
that 1
camp 1
fire 1
stopping 1
every 1
minute 1
or 1
two 1
to 1
listen 1
But 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
no 1
luck 1
somehow 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
place 1
But 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
sure 1
enough 1
I 1
catched 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
fire 1
away 1
through 1
the 1
trees 1
I 1
went 1
for 1
it 1
cautious 1
and 1
slow 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
I 1
was 1
close 1
enough 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
look 1
and 1
there 1
laid 1
a 1
man 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
It 1
most 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
fan 1
tods 1
He 1
had 1
a 1
blanket 1
around 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
his 1
head 1
was 1
nearly 1
in 1
the 1
fire 1
I 1
set 1
there 1
behind 1
a 1
clump 1
of 1
bushes 1
in 1
about 1
six 1
foot 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
kept 1
my 1
eyes 1
on 1
him 1
steady 1
It 1
was 1
getting 1
gray 1
daylight 1
now 1
Pretty 1
soon 1
he 1
gapped 1
and 1
stretched 1
himself 1
and 1
hove 1
off 1
the 1
blanket 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
s 1
Jim 1
I 1
bet 1
I 1
was 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
I 1
says 1
Hello 1
Jim 1
and 1
skipped 1
out 1
He 1
bounced 1
up 1
and 1
stared 1
at 1
me 1
wild 1
Then 1
he 1
drops 1
down 1
on 1
his 1
knees 1
and 1
puts 1
his 1
hands 1
together 1
and 1
says 1

the 1
canoe 1

while 1
he 1
built 1

a 1
grassy 1
open 1
place 1
amongst 1

flying 1
a 1
yard 1
or 1
two 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
and 1
lighting 1
Jim 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
sign 1
it 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
rain 1
He 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
sign 1
when 1
young 1
chickens 1
flew 1
that 1
way 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
reckoned 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
when 1
young 1
birds 1
done 1
it 1
I 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
catch 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
but 1
Jim 1
wouldn 1
t 1
let 1
me 1
He 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
death 1
He 1
said 1
his 1
father 1
laid 1
mighty 1
sick 1
once 1
and 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
catched 1
a 1
bird 1
and 1
his 1
old 1
granny 1
said 1
his 1
father 1
would 1
die 1
and 1
he 1
did 1
And 1
Jim 1
said 1
you 1
mustn 1
t 1
count 1
the 1
things 1
you 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
cook 1
for 1
dinner 1
because 1
that 1
would 1
bring 1
bad 1
luck 1
The 1
same 1
if 1
you 1
shook 1
the 1
table 1
cloth 1
after 1
sundown 1
And 1
he 1
said 1
if 1
a 1
man 1
owned 1
a 1
beehive 1
and 1
that 1
man 1
died 1
the 1
bees 1
must 1
be 1
told 1
about 1
it 1
before 1
sun 1
up 1
next 1
morning 1
or 1
else 1
the 1
bees 1
would 1
all 1
weaken 1
down 1
and 1
quit 1
work 1
and 1
die 1
Jim 1
said 1
bees 1
wouldn 1
t 1
sting 1
idiots 1
but 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
believe 1
that 1
because 1
I 1
had 1
tried 1
them 1
lots 1
of 1
times 1
myself 1
and 1
they 1
wouldn 1
t 1
sting 1
me 1
I 1
had 1
heard 1
about 1
some 1
of 1
these 1
things 1
before 1
but 1
not 1
all 1
of 1

of 1

He 1

CHAPTER 1
IX 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
look 1
at 1
a 1
place 1
right 1
about 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
that 1
I 1
d 1
found 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
exploring 1
so 1
we 1
started 1
and 1
soon 1
got 1
to 1
it 1
because 1
the 1
island 1
was 1
only 1
three 1
miles 1
long 1
and 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
wide 1
This 1
place 1
was 1
a 1
tolerable 1
long 1
steep 1
hill 1
or 1
ridge 1
about 1
forty 1
foot 1
high 1
We 1
had 1
a 1
rough 1
time 1
getting 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
the 1
sides 1
was 1
so 1
steep 1
and 1
the 1
bushes 1
so 1
thick 1
We 1
tramped 1
and 1
clumb 1
around 1
all 1
over 1
it 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
found 1
a 1
good 1
big 1
cavern 1
in 1
the 1
rock 1
most 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
on 1
the 1
side 1
towards 1
Illinois 1
The 1
cavern 1
was 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
rooms 1
bunched 1
together 1
and 1
Jim 1
could 1
stand 1
up 1
straight 1
in 1
it 1
It 1
was 1
cool 1
in 1
there 1
Jim 1
was 1
for 1
putting 1
our 1
traps 1
in 1
there 1
right 1
away 1
but 1
I 1
said 1
we 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
climbing 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
there 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
Jim 1
said 1
if 1
we 1
had 1
the 1
canoe 1
hid 1
in 1
a 1
good 1
place 1
and 1
had 1
all 1
the 1
traps 1
in 1
the 1
cavern 1
we 1
could 1
rush 1
there 1
if 1
anybody 1
was 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
island 1
and 1
they 1
would 1
never 1
find 1
us 1
without 1
dogs 1
And 1
besides 1
he 1
said 1
them 1
little 1
birds 1
had 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
rain 1
and 1
did 1
I 1
want 1
the 1
things 1
to 1
get 1
wet 1
So 1
we 1
went 1
back 1
and 1
got 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
paddled 1
up 1
abreast 1
the 1
cavern 1
and 1
lugged 1
all 1
the 1
traps 1
up 1
there 1
Then 1
we 1
hunted 1
up 1
a 1
place 1
close 1
by 1
to 1
hide 1
the 1
canoe 1
in 1
amongst 1
the 1
thick 1
willows 1
We 1
took 1
some 1
fish 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
lines 1
and 1
set 1
them 1
again 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
get 1
ready 1
for 1
dinner 1
The 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
cavern 1
was 1
big 1
enough 1
to 1
roll 1
a 1
hogshead 1
in 1
and 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
the 1
floor 1
stuck 1
out 1
a 1
little 1
bit 1
and 1
was 1
flat 1
and 1
a 1
good 1
place 1
to 1
build 1
a 1
fire 1
on 1
So 1
we 1
built 1
it 1
there 1
and 1
cooked 1
dinner 1
We 1
spread 1
the 1
blankets 1
inside 1
for 1
a 1
carpet 1
and 1
eat 1
our 1
dinner 1
in 1
there 1
We 1
put 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
things 1
handy 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
cavern 1
Pretty 1
soon 1
it 1
darkened 1
up 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
thunder 1
and 1
lighten 1
so 1
the 1
birds 1
was 1
right 1
about 1
it 1
Directly 1
it 1
begun 1
to 1
rain 1
and 1
it 1
rained 1
like 1
all 1
fury 1
too 1
and 1
I 1
never 1
see 1
the 1
wind 1
blow 1
so 1
It 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
regular 1
summer 1
storms 1
It 1
would 1
get 1
so 1
dark 1
that 1
it 1
looked 1
all 1
blue 1
black 1
outside 1
and 1
lovely 1
and 1
the 1
rain 1
would 1
thrash 1
along 1
by 1
so 1
thick 1
that 1
the 1
trees 1
off 1
a 1
little 1
ways 1
looked 1
dim 1
and 1
spider 1
webby 1
and 1
here 1
would 1
come 1
a 1
blast 1
of 1
wind 1
that 1
would 1
bend 1
the 1
trees 1
down 1
and 1
turn 1
up 1
the 1
pale 1
underside 1
of 1
the 1
leaves 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
perfect 1
ripper 1
of 1
a 1
gust 1
would 1
follow 1
along 1
and 1
set 1
the 1
branches 1
to 1
tossing 1
their 1
arms 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
was 1
just 1
wild 1
and 1
next 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
about 1
the 1
bluest 1
and 1
blackest 1
FST 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
bright 1
as 1
glory 1
and 1
you 1
d 1
have 1
a 1
little 1
glimpse 1
of 1
tree 1
tops 1
a 1
plunging 1
about 1
away 1
off 1
yonder 1
in 1
the 1
storm 1
hundreds 1
of 1
yards 1
further 1
than 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
before 1
dark 1
as 1
sin 1
again 1
in 1
a 1
second 1
and 1
now 1
you 1
d 1
hear 1
the 1
thunder 1
let 1
go 1
with 1
an 1
awful 1
crash 1
and 1
then 1
go 1
rumbling 1
grumbling 1
tumbling 1
down 1
the 1
sky 1
towards 1
the 1
under 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
like 1
rolling 1
empty 1
barrels 1
down 1
stairs 1
where 1
it 1

long 1
stairs 1
and 1

The 1
river 1
went 1
on 1
raising 1
and 1
raising 1
for 1
ten 1
or 1
twelve 1
days 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
it 1
was 1
over 1
the 1
banks 1
The 1
water 1
was 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
foot 1
deep 1
on 1
the 1
island 1
in 1
the 1
low 1
places 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
Illinois 1
bottom 1
On 1
that 1
side 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
many 1
miles 1
wide 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
Missouri 1
side 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
old 1
distance 1
across 1
a 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
because 1
the 1
Missouri 1
shore 1
was 1
just 1
a 1
wall 1
of 1
high 1
bluffs 1
Daytimes 1
we 1
paddled 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
island 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
It 1
was 1
mighty 1
cool 1
and 1
shady 1
in 1
the 1
deep 1
woods 1
even 1
if 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
blazing 1
outside 1
We 1
went 1
winding 1
in 1
and 1
out 1
amongst 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
sometimes 1
the 1
vines 1
hung 1
so 1
thick 1
we 1
had 1
to 1
back 1
away 1
and 1
go 1
some 1
other 1
way 1
Well 1
on 1
every 1
old 1
broken 1
down 1
tree 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
rabbits 1
and 1
snakes 1
and 1
such 1
things 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
island 1
had 1
been 1
overflowed 1
a 1
day 1
or 1
two 1
they 1
got 1
so 1
tame 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
being 1
hungry 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
paddle 1
right 1
up 1
and 1
put 1
your 1
hand 1
on 1
them 1
if 1
you 1
wanted 1
to 1
but 1
not 1
the 1
snakes 1
and 1
turtles 1
they 1
would 1
slide 1
off 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
The 1
ridge 1
our 1
cavern 1
was 1
in 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
them 1
We 1
could 1
a 1
had 1
pets 1
enough 1
if 1
we 1
d 1
wanted 1
them 1
One 1
night 1
we 1
catched 1
a 1
little 1
section 1
of 1
a 1
lumber 1
raft 1
nice 1
pine 1
planks 1
It 1
was 1
twelve 1
foot 1
wide 1
and 1
about 1
fifteen 1
or 1
sixteen 1
foot 1
long 1
and 1
the 1
top 1
stood 1
above 1
water 1
six 1
or 1
seven 1
inches 1
a 1
solid 1
level 1
floor 1
We 1
could 1
see 1
saw 1
logs 1
go 1
by 1
in 1
the 1
daylight 1
sometimes 1
but 1
we 1
let 1
them 1
go 1
we 1
didn 1
t 1
show 1
ourselves 1
in 1
daylight 1
Another 1
night 1
when 1
we 1
was 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
just 1
before 1
daylight 1
here 1
comes 1
a 1
frame 1
house 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
west 1
side 1
She 1
was 1
a 1
two 1
story 1
and 1
tilted 1
over 1
considerable 1
We 1
paddled 1
out 1
and 1
got 1
aboard 1
clumb 1
in 1
at 1
an 1
upstairs 1
window 1
But 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
dark 1
to 1
see 1
yet 1
so 1
we 1
made 1
the 1
canoe 1
fast 1
and 1
set 1
in 1
her 1
to 1
wait 1
for 1
daylight 1
The 1
light 1
begun 1
to 1
come 1
before 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
Then 1
we 1
looked 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
We 1
could 1
make 1
out 1
a 1
bed 1
and 1
a 1
table 1
and 1
two 1
old 1
chairs 1
and 1
lots 1
of 1
things 1
around 1
about 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
clothes 1
hanging 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
There 1
was 1
something 1
laying 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
in 1
the 1
far 1
corner 1
that 1
looked 1
like 1
a 1
man 1
So 1
Jim 1
says 1
Hello 1
you 1
But 1
it 1
didn 1
t 1
budge 1
So 1
I 1
hollered 1
again 1
and 1
then 1
Jim 1
says 1
De 1
man 1

t 1
asleep 1
he 1
s 1

You 1
hold 1
still 1
I 1
ll 1
go 1
en 1

He 1
went 1
and 1
bent 1
down 1
and 1
looked 1
and 1
says 1
It 1
s 1
a 1
dead 1
man 1
Yes 1

He 1

Come 1

Huck 1
but 1
doan 1
look 1
at 1
his 1
face 1
it 1
s 1
too 1
gashly 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
look 1
at 1
him 1
at 1
all 1
Jim 1
throwed 1
some 1
old 1
rags 1
over 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
needn 1
t 1
done 1
it 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
There 1
was 1
heaps 1
of 1
old 1
greasy 1
cards 1
scattered 1
around 1
over 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
old 1
whisky 1
bottles 1
and 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
masks 1
made 1
out 1
of 1
black 1
cloth 1
and 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
walls 1
was 1
the 1
ignorantest 1
kind 1
of 1
words 1
and 1
pictures 1
made 1
with 1
charcoal 1
There 1
was 1
two 1
old 1
dirty 1
calico 1
dresses 1
and 1
a 1
sun 1
bonnet 1
and 1
some 1
women 1
s 1
underclothes 1
hanging 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
some 1
men 1
s 1
clothing 1
too 1
We 1
put 1
the 1
lot 1
into 1
the 1
canoe 1
it 1
might 1
come 1
good 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
boy 1
s 1
old 1
speckled 1
straw 1
hat 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
I 1
took 1
that 1
too 1
And 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
bottle 1
that 1
had 2
milk 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
had 1
a 1
rag 1
stopper 1
for 1
a 1
baby 1
to 1
suck 1
We 1
would 1
a 1
took 1
the 1
bottle 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
broke 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
seedy 1
old 1
chest 1
and 1
an 1
old 1
hair 1
trunk 1
with 1
the 1
hinges 1
broke 1
They 1
stood 1
open 1
but 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
nothing 1
left 1
in 1
them 1
that 1
was 1
any 1
account 1
The 1
way 1
things 1
was 1
scattered 1
about 1
we 1
reckoned 1
the 1
people 1
left 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
and 1
warn 1
t 1
fixed 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
carry 1
off 1
most 1
of 1
their 1
stuff 1
We 1
got 1
an 1
old 1
tin 1
lantern 1
and 1
a 1
butcher 1
knife 1
without 1
any 1
handle 1
and 1
a 1
bran 1
new 1
Barlow 1
knife 1
worth 1
two 1
bits 1
in 1
any 1
store 1
and 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
tallow 1
candles 1
and 1
a 1
tin 1
candlestick 1
and 1
a 1
gourd 1
and 1
a 1
tin 1
cup 1
and 1
a 1
ratty 1
old 1
bedquilt 1
off 1
the 1
bed 1
and 1
a 1
reticule 1
with 1
needles 1
and 1
pins 1
and 1
beeswax 1
and 1
buttons 1
and 1
thread 1
and 1
all 1
such 1
truck 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
a 1
hatchet 1
and 1
some 1
nails 1
and 1
a 1
fishline 1
as 1
thick 1
as 1
my 1
little 1
finger 1
with 1
some 1
monstrous 1
hooks 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
a 1
roll 1
of 1
buckskin 1
and 1
a 1
leather 1
dog 1
collar 1
and 1
a 1
horseshoe 1
and 1
some 1
vials 1
of 1
medicine 1
that 1
didn 1
t 1
have 1
no 1
label 1
on 1
them 1
and 1
just 1
as 1
we 1
was 1
leaving 1
I 1
found 1
a 1
tolerable 1
good 1
curry 1
comb 1
and 1
Jim 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
ratty 1
old 1
fiddle 1
bow 1
and 1
a 1
wooden 1
leg 1
The 1
straps 1
was 1
broke 1
off 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
barring 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
enough 1
leg 1
though 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
long 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
not 1
long 1
enough 1
for 1
Jim 1
and 1
we 1
couldn 1
t 1
find 1
the 1
other 1
one 1
though 1
we 1
hunted 1
all 1
around 1
And 1
so 1
take 1
it 1
all 1
around 1
we 1
made 1
a 1
good 1
haul 1
When 1
we 1
was 1
ready 1
to 1
shove 1
off 1
we 1
was 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
below 1
the 1
island 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
pretty 1
broad 1
day 1
so 1
I 1
made 1
Jim 1
lay 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
cover 1
up 1
with 1
the 1
quilt 1
because 1
if 1
he 1
set 1
up 1
people 1
could 1
tell 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
nigger 1
a 1
good 1
ways 1
off 1
I 1
paddled 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
Illinois 1
shore 1
and 1
drifted 1
down 1
most 1
a 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
doing 1
it 1
I 1
crept 1
up 1
the 1
dead 1
water 1
under 1
the 1
bank 1
and 1
hadn 1
t 1
no 1
accidents 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
see 1
nobody 1
We 1
got 1
home 1
all 1
safe 1
CHAPTER 1
X 1
AFTER 1
breakfast 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
talk 1
about 1
the 1
dead 1
man 1
and 1
guess 1
out 1
how 1
he 1
come 1
to 1
be 1
killed 1
but 1
Jim 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
He 1
said 1
it 1
would 1
fetch 1
bad 1
luck 1
and 1
besides 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
might 1
come 1
and 1
ha 1
nt 1
us 1
he 1
said 1
a 1
man 1
that 1
warn 1
t 1
buried 1
was 1
more 1
likely 1
to 1
go 1
a 1
ha 1
nting 1
around 1
than 1
one 1
that 1
was 1
planted 1
and 1
comfortable 1
That 1
sounded 1
pretty 1
reasonable 1
so 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
say 1
no 1
more 1
but 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
keep 1
from 1
studying 1
over 1
it 1
and 1
wishing 1
I 1
knowed 1
who 1
shot 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
what 1
they 1
done 1
it 1
for 1
We 1
rummaged 1
the 1
clothes 1
we 1
d 1
got 1
and 1
found 1
eight 1
dollars 1
in 1
silver 1
sewed 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
lining 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
blanket 1
overcoat 1
Jim 1
said 1
he 1
reckoned 1
the 1
people 1
in 1
that 1
house 1
stole 1
the 1
coat 1
because 1
if 1
they 1
d 1
a 1
knowed 1
the 1
money 1
was 1
there 1
they 1
wouldn 1
t 1
a 1
left 1
it 1
I 1
said 1
I 1
reckoned 1
they 1
killed 1
him 1
too 1
but 1
Jim 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
talk 1
about 1
that 1
I 1
says 1
Now 1
you 1
think 1
it 1
s 1
bad 1
luck 1
but 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
say 1
when 1
I 1
fetched 1
in 1
the 1
snake 1
skin 1
that 1
I 1
found 1
on 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
ridge 1
day 1
before 1
yesterday 1
You 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
worst 1
bad 1
luck 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
touch 1
a 1
snake 1
skin 1
with 1
my 1
hands 1
Well 1
here 1
s 1
your 1
bad 1
luck 1
We 1
ve 1
raked 1
in 1
all 1
this 1
truck 1
and 1
eight 1
dollars 1
besides 1
I 1
wish 1
we 1
could 1
have 1
some 1
bad 1
luck 1
like 1
this 1
every 1
day 1
Jim 1
Never 1
you 1
mind 1
honey 1
never 1
you 1
mind 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
git 1
too 1
peart 1
It 1
s 1
a 1
comin 1
Mind 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
comin 1
It 1
did 1
come 1
too 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
Tuesday 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
that 1
talk 1
Well 1
after 1
dinner 1
Friday 1
we 1
was 1
laying 1
around 1
in 1
the 1
grass 1
at 1
the 1
upper 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
ridge 1
and 1
got 1
out 1
of 1
tobacco 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
cavern 1
to 1
get 1
some 1
and 1
found 1
a 1
rattlesnake 1
in 1
there 1
I 1
killed 1
him 1
and 1
curled 1
him 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
Jim 1
s 1
blanket 1
ever 1
so 1
natural 1
thinking 1
there 1
d 1
be 1
some 1
fun 1
when 1
Jim 1
found 1
him 1
there 1
Well 1
by 1
night 1
I 1
forgot 1
all 1
about 1
the 1
snake 1
and 1
when 1
Jim 1
flung 1
himself 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
blanket 1
while 1
I 1
struck 1
a 1
light 1
the 1
snake 1
s 1
mate 1
was 1
there 1
and 1
bit 1
him 1
He 1
jumped 1
up 1
yelling 1
and 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
the 1
light 1
showed 1
was 1
the 1
varmint 1
curled 1
up 1
and 1
ready 1
for 1
another 1
spring 1
I 1
laid 1
him 1
out 1
in 1
a 1
second 1
with 1
a 1
stick 1
and 1
Jim 1
grabbed 1
pap 1
s 1
whisky 1
jug 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
pour 1
it 1
down 1
He 1
was 1
barefooted 1
and 1
the 1
snake 1
bit 1
him 1
right 1
on 1
the 1
heel 1
That 1
all 1
comes 1
of 1
my 1
being 1
such 1
a 1
fool 1
as 1
to 1
not 1
remember 1
that 1
wherever 1
you 1
leave 1
a 1
dead 1
snake 1
its 1
mate 1
always 1
comes 1
there 1
and 1
curls 1
around 1
it 1
Jim 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
chop 1
off 1
the 1
snake 1
s 1
head 1
and 1
throw 1
it 1
away 1
and 1
then 1
skin 1
the 1
body 1
and 1
roast 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
it 1
I 1
done 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
eat 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
would 1
help 1
cure 1
him 1
He 1
made 1
me 1
take 1
off 1
the 1
rattles 1
and 1
tie 1
them 1
around 1
his 1
wrist 1
too 1
He 1
said 1
that 2
would 1
help 1
Then 1
I 1
slid 1
out 1
quiet 1
and 1
throwed 1
the 1
snakes 1
clear 1
away 1
amongst 1
the 1
bushes 1
for 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
going 1
to 1
let 1
Jim 1
find 1
out 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
my 1
fault 1
not 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
help 1
it 1
Jim 1
sucked 1
and 1
sucked 1
at 1
the 1
jug 1
and 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
got 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
pitched 1
around 1
and 1
yelled 1
but 1
every 1
time 1
he 1
come 1
to 1
himself 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
sucking 1
at 1
the 1
jug 1
again 1
His 1
foot 1
swelled 1
up 1
pretty 1
big 1
and 1
so 1
did 1
his 1
leg 1
but 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
drunk 1
begun 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
so 1
I 1
judged 1
he 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
but 1
I 1
d 1
druther 1
been 1
bit 1
with 1
a 1
snake 1
than 1
pap 1
s 1
whisky 1
Jim 1
was 1
laid 1
up 1
for 1
four 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
Then 1
the 1
swelling 1
was 1
all 1
gone 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
around 1
again 1
I 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
ever 1
take 1
a 1
holt 1
of 1
a 1
snake 1
skin 1
again 1
with 1
my 1
hands 1
now 1
that 1
I 1
see 1
what 1
had 1
come 1
of 1
it 1
Jim 1
said 1
he 1
reckoned 1
I 1
would 1
believe 1
him 1
next 1
time 1
And 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
handling 1
a 1
snake 1
skin 1
was 1
such 1
awful 1
bad 1
luck 1
that 1
maybe 1
we 1
hadn 1
t 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
it 1
yet 1
He 1
said 1
he 1
druther 1
see 1
the 1
new 1
moon 1
over 1
his 1
left 1
shoulder 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
a 1
thousand 1
times 1
than 1
take 1
up 1
a 1
snake 1
skin 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
Well 1
I 1
was 1
getting 1
to 1
feel 1
that 1
way 1
myself 1
though 1
I 1
ve 1
always 1
reckoned 1
that 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
new 1
moon 1
over 1
your 1
left 1
shoulder 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
carelessest 1
and 1
foolishest 1
things 1
a 1
body 1
can 1
do 1
Old 1
Hank 1
Bunker 1
done 1
it 1
once 1
and 1
bragged 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
in 1
less 1
than 1
two 1
years 1
he 1
got 1
drunk 1
and 1
fell 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
shot 1
tower 1
and 1
spread 1
himself 1
out 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
just 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
layer 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
say 1
and 1
they 1
slid 1
him 1
edgeways 1
between 1
two 1
barn 1
doors 1
for 1
a 1
coffin 1
and 1
buried 1
him 1
so 2
they 1
say 1
but 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
see 1
it 1
Pap 1
told 1
me 1
But 1
anyway 1
it 1
all 1
come 1
of 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
moon 1
that 1
way 1
like 1
a 1
fool 1
Well 1
the 1
days 1
went 1
along 1
and 1
the 1
river 1
went 1
down 1
between 1
its 1
banks 1
again 1
and 1
about 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
we 1
done 1
was 1
to 1
bait 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
big 1
hooks 1
with 1
a 1
skinned 1
rabbit 1
and 1
set 1
it 1
and 1
catch 1
a 1
catfish 1
that 1
was 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
a 1
man 1
being 1
six 1
foot 1
two 1
inches 1
long 1
and 1
weighed 1
over 1
two 1
hundred 1
pounds 1
We 1
couldn 1
t 1
handle 1
him 1
of 1
course 1
he 1
would 1
a 1
flung 1
us 1
into 1
Illinois 1
We 1
just 1
set 1
there 1
and 1
watched 1
him 1
rip 1
and 1
tear 1
around 1
till 1
he 1
drownded 1
We 1
found 1
a 1
brass 1
button 1
in 1
his 1
stomach 1
and 1
a 1
round 1
ball 1
and 1
lots 1
of 1
rubbage 1
We 1
split 1
the 1
ball 1
open 1
with 1
the 1
hatchet 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
spool 1
in 1
it 1
Jim 1
said 1
he 1
d 1
had 1
it 1
there 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
to 1
coat 1
it 1
over 1
so 1
and 1
make 1
a 1
ball 1
of 1
it 1
It 1
was 1
as 1
big 1
a 1
fish 1
as 1
was 1
ever 1
catched 1
in 1
the 1
Mississippi 1
I 1
reckon 1
Jim 1
said 1
he 1
hadn 1
t 1
ever 1
seen 1
a 1
bigger 1
one 1
He 1
would 1
a 1
been 1
worth 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
over 1
at 1
the 1
village 1
They 1
peddle 1
out 1
such 1
a 1
fish 1
as 1
that 1
by 1
the 1
pound 1
in 1
the 1
market 1
house 1
there 1
everybody 1
buys 1
some 1
of 1
him 1
his 1
meat 1
s 1
as 1
white 1
as 1
snow 1
and 1
makes 1
a 1
good 1
fry 1
Next 1
morning 1
I 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
getting 1
slow 1
and 1
dull 1
and 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
stirring 1
up 1
some 1
way 1
I 1
said 1
I 1
reckoned 1
I 1
would 1
slip 1
over 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
find 1
out 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
Jim 1
liked 1
that 1
notion 1
but 1
he 1
said 1
I 1
must 1
go 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
and 1
look 1
sharp 1
Then 1
he 1
studied 1
it 1
over 1
and 1
said 1
couldn 1
t 1
I 1
put 1
on 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
old 1
things 1
and 1
dress 1
up 1
like 1
a 1
girl 1
That 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
notion 1
too 1
So 1
we 1
shortened 1
up 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
calico 1
gowns 1
and 1
I 1
turned 1
up 1
my 1
trouser 1
legs 1
to 1
my 1
knees 1
and 1
got 1
into 1
it 1
Jim 1
hitched 1
it 1
behind 1
with 1
the 1
hooks 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
fair 1
fit 1
I 1
put 1
on 1
the 1
sun 1
bonnet 1
and 1
tied 1
it 1
under 1
my 1
chin 1
and 1
then 1
for 1
a 1
body 1
to 1
look 1
in 1
and 1
see 1
my 1
face 1
was 1
like 1
looking 1
down 1
a 1
joint 1
of 1
stove 1
pipe 1
Jim 1
said 1
nobody 1
would 1
know 1
me 1
even 1
in 1
the 1
daytime 1
hardly 1
I 1
practiced 1
around 1
all 1
day 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
hang 1
of 1
the 1
things 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
I 1
could 1
do 1
pretty 1
well 1
in 1
them 1
only 1
Jim 1
said 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
walk 1
like 1
a 1
girl 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
I 1
must 1
quit 1
pulling 1
up 1
my 1
gown 1
to 1
get 1
at 1
my 1
britches 1
pocket 1
I 1
took 1
notice 1
and 1
done 1
better 1
I 1
started 1
up 1
the 1
Illinois 1
shore 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
just 1
after 1
dark 1
I 1
started 1
across 1
to 1
the 1
town 1
from 1
a 1
little 1
below 1
the 1
ferry 1
landing 1
and 1
the 1
drift 1
of 1
the 1
current 1
fetched 1
me 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
I 1
tied 1
up 1
and 1
started 1
along 1
the 1
bank 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
light 1
burning 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
shanty 1
that 1
hadn 1
t 1
been 1
lived 1
in 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
and 1
I 1
wondered 1
who 1
had 1
took 1
up 1
quarters 1
there 1
I 1
slipped 1
up 1
and 1
peeped 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
woman 1
about 1
forty 1
year 1
old 1
in 1
there 1
knitting 1
by 1
a 1
candle 1
that 1
was 1
on 1
a 1
pine 1
table 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
her 1
face 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
stranger 1
for 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
start 1
a 1
face 1
in 1
that 1
town 1
that 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
Now 1
this 1
was 1
lucky 1
because 1
I 1
was 1
weakening 1
I 1
was 1
getting 1
afraid 1
I 1
had 1
come 1
people 1
might 1
know 1
my 1
voice 1
and 1
find 1
me 1
out 1
But 1
if 1
this 1
woman 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
little 1
town 1
two 1
days 1
she 1
could 1
tell 1
me 1
all 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
so 1
I 1
knocked 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
forget 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
girl 1
CHAPTER 1

She 1

She 1

shiny 1
eyes 1

a 1
while 1
I 1
reckon 1
and 1
go 1
on 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
afeared 1
of 1
the 1
dark 1
She 1
said 1
she 1
wouldn 1
t 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
by 1
myself 1
but 1
her 1
husband 1
would 1
be 1
in 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
maybe 1
in 1
a 1
hour 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
and 1
she 1
d 1
send 1
him 1
along 1
with 1
me 1
Then 1
she 1
got 1
to 1
talking 1
about 1
her 1
husband 1
and 1
about 1
her 1
relations 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
her 1
relations 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
about 1
how 1
much 1
better 1
off 1
they 1
used 1
to 1
was 1
and 1
how 1
they 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
but 1
they 1
d 1
made 1
a 1
mistake 1
coming 1
to 1
our 1
town 1
instead 1
of 1
letting 1
well 1
alone 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
till 1
I 1
was 1
afeard 1
I 1
had 1
made 1
a 1
mistake 1
coming 1
to 1
her 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
but 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
she 1
dropped 1
on 1
to 1
pap 1
and 1
the 1
murder 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
was 1
pretty 1
willing 1
to 1
let 1
her 1
clatter 1
right 1
along 1
She 1
told 1
about 1
me 1
and 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
finding 1
the 1
six 1
thousand 1
dollars 1
only 1
she 1
got 1
it 1
ten 1
and 1
all 1
about 1
pap 1
and 1
what 1
a 1
hard 1
lot 1
he 1
was 1
and 1
what 1
a 1
hard 1
lot 1
I 1
was 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
she 1
got 1
down 1
to 1
where 1
I 1
was 1
murdered 1
I 1
says 1
Who 1
done 1
it 1
We 1
ve 1
heard 1
considerable 1
about 1
these 1
goings 1
on 1
down 1
in 1
Hookerville 1
but 1
we 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
who 1
twas 1
that 1
killed 1
Huck 1
Finn 1
Well 1
I 1
reckon 1
there 1
s 1
a 1
right 1
smart 1
chance 1
of 1
people 1
here 1
that 1
d 1
like 1
to 1
know 1
who 1
killed 1
him 1
Some 1
think 1
old 1
Finn 1
done 1
it 1
himself 1
No 1
is 1
that 1
so 1
Most 1
everybody 1
thought 1
it 1
at 1
first 1
He 1
ll 1
never 1
know 1
how 1
nigh 1
he 1
come 1
to 1
getting 1
lynched 1
But 1
before 1
night 1
they 1
changed 1
around 1
and 1
judged 1
it 1
was 1
done 1
by 1
a 1
runaway 1
nigger 1
named 1
Jim 1
Why 1
he 1
I 1
stopped 1
I 1
reckoned 1
I 1
better 1
keep 1
still 1
She 1
run 1
on 1
and 1
never 1
noticed 1
I 1
had 1
put 1
in 1
at 1
all 1
The 1
nigger 1
run 1
off 1
the 1
very 1
night 1
Huck 1
Finn 1
was 1
killed 1
So 1
there 1
s 1
a 1
reward 1
out 1
for 1
him 1
three 1
hundred 1
dollars 1
And 1
there 1
s 1
a 1
reward 1
out 1
for 1
old 1
Finn 1
too 1
two 1
hundred 1
dollars 1
You 1
see 1
he 1
come 1
to 1
town 1
the 1
morning 1
after 1
the 1
murder 1
and 1
told 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
was 1
out 1
with 1
em 1
on 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
hunt 1
and 1
right 1
away 1
after 1
he 1
up 1
and 1
left 1
Before 1
night 1
they 1
wanted 1
to 1
lynch 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
gone 1
you 1
see 1
Well 1
next 1
day 1
they 1
found 1
out 1
the 1
nigger 1
was 1
gone 1
they 1
found 1
out 1
he 1
hadn 1
t 1
ben 1
seen 1
sence 1
ten 1
o 1
clock 1
the 1
night 1
the 1
murder 1
was 1
done 1
So 1
then 1
they 1
put 1
it 1
on 1
him 1
you 1
see 1
and 1
while 1
they 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
it 1
next 1
day 1
back 1
comes 1
old 1
Finn 1
and 1
went 1
boo 1
hooing 1
to 1
Judge 1
Thatcher 1
to 1
get 1
money 1
to 1
hunt 1
for 1
the 1
nigger 1
all 1
over 1
Illinois 1
with 1
The 1
judge 1
gave 1
him 1
some 1
and 1
that 1
evening 1
he 1
got 1
drunk 1
and 1
was 1
around 1
till 1
after 1
midnight 1
with 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
mighty 1
hard 1
looking 1
strangers 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
off 1
with 1
them 1
Well 1
he 1
hain 1
t 1
come 1
back 1
sence 1
and 1
they 1
ain 1
t 1
looking 1
for 1
him 1
back 1
till 1
this 1
thing 1
blows 1
over 1
a 1
little 1
for 1
people 1
thinks 1
now 1
that 1
he 1
killed 1
his 1
boy 1
and 1
fixed 1
things 1
so 1
folks 1
would 1
think 1
robbers 1
done 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
d 1
get 1
Huck 1
s 1
money 1
without 1
having 1
to 1
bother 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
with 1
a 1
lawsuit 1
People 1
do 1
say 1
he 1
warn 1
t 1
any 1
too 1
good 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
Oh 1
he 1
s 1
sly 1
I 1
reckon 1
If 1
he 1
don 1
t 1
come 1
back 1
for 1
a 1
year 1
he 1
ll 1
be 1
all 1
right 1
You 1
can 1
t 1
prove 1
anything 1
on 1
him 1
you 1
know 1
everything 1
will 1
be 1
quieted 1
down 1
then 1
and 1
he 1
ll 1
walk 1
in 1
Huck 1
s 1
money 1
as 1
easy 1
as 1
nothing 1
Yes 1
I 1
reckon 1
so 1
m 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
see 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
it 1
Has 1
everybody 1
quit 1
thinking 1
the 1
nigger 1
done 1
it 1
Oh 1
no 1
not 1
everybody 1
A 1
good 1
many 1
thinks 1
he 1
done 1
it 1
But 1
they 1
ll 1
get 1
the 1
nigger 1
pretty 1
soon 1
now 1
and 1
maybe 1
they 1
can 1
scare 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
him 1
Why 1
are 1
they 1
after 1
him 1
yet 1
Well 1
you 1
re 1
innocent 1
ain 1
t 1
you 1
Does 1
three 1
hundred 1
dollars 1
lay 1
around 1
every 1
day 1
for 1
people 1
to 1
pick 1
up 1
Some 1
folks 1
think 1
the 1
nigger 1
ain 1
t 1
far 1
from 1
here 1
I 1
m 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
but 1
I 1
hain 1
t 1
talked 1
it 1
around 1
A 1
few 1
days 1
ago 1
I 1
was 1
talking 1
with 1
an 1
old 1
couple 1
that 1
lives 1
next 1
door 1
in 1
the 1
log 1
shanty 1
and 1
they 1
happened 1
to 1
say 1
hardly 1
anybody 1
ever 1
goes 1
to 1
that 1
island 1
over 1
yonder 1
that 1
they 1
call 1
Jackson 1
s 1
Island 1
Don 1
t 1
anybody 1
live 1
there 1
says 1
I 1
No 1
nobody 1
says 1
they 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
say 1
any 1
more 1
but 1
I 1
done 1
some 1
thinking 1
I 1
was 1
pretty 1
near 1
certain 1
I 1
d 1
seen 1
smoke 1
over 1
there 1
about 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
a 1
day 1
or 1
two 1
before 1
that 1
so 1
I 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
like 1
as 1
not 1
that 1
nigger 1
s 1
hiding 1
over 1
there 1
anyway 1
says 1
I 1
it 1
s 1
worth 1
the 1
trouble 1
to 1
give 1
the 1
place 1
a 1
hunt 1
I 1
hain 1
t 1
seen 1
any 1
smoke 1
sence 1
so 1
I 1
reckon 1
maybe 1
he 1
s 1
gone 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
him 1
but 1
husband 1
s 1
going 1
over 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
and 1
another 1
man 1
He 1
was 1
gone 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
but 1
he 1
got 1
back 1
to 1
day 1
and 1
I 1
told 1
him 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
got 1
here 1
two 1
hours 1
ago 1
I 1
had 1
got 1
so 1
uneasy 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
set 1
still 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
something 1
with 1
my 1
hands 1
so 1
I 1
took 1
up 1
a 1
needle 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
threading 1
it 1
My 1
hands 1
shook 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
making 1
a 1
bad 1
job 1
of 1
it 1
When 1
the 1
woman 1
stopped 1
talking 1
I 1
looked 1
up 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
looking 1
at 1
me 1
pretty 1
curious 1
and 1
smiling 1
a 1
little 1
I 1
put 1
down 1
the 1
needle 1
and 1
thread 1
and 1
let 1
on 1
to 1
be 1
interested 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
too 1
and 1
says 1
Three 1
hundred 1
dollars 1
is 1
a 1
power 1
of 1
money 1
I 1
wish 1
my 1
mother 1
could 1
get 1
it 1
Is 1
your 1
husband 1
going 1
over 1
there 1
to 1
night 1
Oh 1
yes 1
He 1
went 1
up 1
town 1
with 1
the 1
man 1
I 1
was 1
telling 1
you 1
of 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
boat 1
and 1
see 1
if 1
they 1
could 1
borrow 1
another 1
gun 1
They 1
ll 1
go 1
over 1
after 1
midnight 1
Couldn 1
t 1
they 1
see 1
better 1
if 1
they 1
was 1
to 1
wait 1
till 1
daytime 1
Yes 1
And 1
couldn 1
t 1
the 1
nigger 1
see 1
better 1
too 1
After 1
midnight 1
he 1
ll 1
likely 1
be 1
asleep 1
and 1
they 1
can 1
slip 1
around 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
hunt 1
up 1
his 1
camp 1
fire 1
all 1
the 1
better 1
for 1
the 1
dark 1
if 1
he 1
s 1
got 1
one 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
think 1
of 1
that 1
The 1
woman 1
kept 1
looking 1
at 1
me 1
pretty 1
curious 1
and 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
feel 1
a 1
bit 1
comfortable 1
Pretty 1
soon 1
she 1
says 1
What 1
did 1
you 1
say 1
your 1
name 1
was 1
honey 1
M 1
Mary 1
Williams 1
Somehow 1
it 1
didn 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
Mary 1
before 1
so 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
look 1
up 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
Sarah 1
so 1
I 1
felt 1
sort 1
of 1
cornered 1
and 1
was 1
afeared 1
maybe 1
I 1
was 1
looking 1
it 1
too 1
I 1
wished 1
the 1
woman 1
would 1
say 1
something 1
more 1
the 1
longer 1
she 1
set 1
still 1
the 1
uneasier 1
I 1
was 1
But 1
now 1
she 1
says 1
Honey 1
I 1
thought 1
you 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
Sarah 1
when 1
you 1
first 1
come 1
in 1
Oh 1
yes 1
m 1
I 1
did 1
Sarah 1
Mary 1
Williams 1
Sarah 1
s 1
my 1
first 1
name 1
Some 1
calls 1
me 1
Sarah 1
some 1
calls 1
me 1
Mary 1
Oh 1
that 1
s 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
it 1
Yes 1
m 1
I 1
was 1
feeling 1
better 1
then 1
but 1
I 1
wished 1
I 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
there 1
anyway 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
look 1
up 1
yet 1
Well 1
the 1
woman 1
fell 1
to 1
talking 1
about 1
how 1
hard 1
times 1
was 1
and 1
how 1
poor 1
they 1
had 1
to 1
live 1
and 1
how 1
the 1
rats 1
was 1
as 1
free 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
owned 1
the 1
place 1
and 1
so 1
forth 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
got 1
easy 1
again 1
She 1
was 1
right 1
about 1
the 1
rats 1
You 1
d 1
see 1
one 1
stick 1
his 1
nose 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
hole 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
every 1
little 1
while 1
She 1
said 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
have 1
things 1
handy 1
to 1
throw 1
at 1
them 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
alone 1
or 1
they 1
wouldn 1
t 1
give 1
her 1
no 1
peace 1
She 1
showed 1
me 1
a 1
bar 1
of 1
lead 1
twisted 1
up 1
into 1
a 1
knot 1
and 1
said 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
shot 1
with 1
it 1
generly 1
but 1
she 1
d 1
wrenched 1
her 1
arm 1
a 1
day 1
or 1
two 1
ago 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
whether 1
she 1
could 1
throw 1
true 1
now 1
But 1
she 1
watched 1
for 1
a 1
chance 1
and 1
directly 1
banged 1
away 1
at 1
a 1
rat 1
but 1
she 1
missed 1
him 1
wide 1
and 1
said 1
Ouch 1
it 1
hurt 1
her 1
arm 1
so 1
Then 1
she 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
try 1
for 1
the 1
next 1
one 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
be 1
getting 1
away 1
before 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
got 1
back 1
but 1
of 1
course 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
let 1
on 1
I 1
got 1
the 1
thing 1
and 1
the 1
first 1
rat 1
that 1
showed 1
his 1
nose 1
I 1
let 1
drive 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
d 1
a 1
stayed 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
he 1
d 1
a 1
been 1
a 1
tolerable 1
sick 1
rat 1
She 1
said 1
that 1
was 1
first 1
rate 1
and 1
she 1
reckoned 1
I 1
would 1
hive 1
the 1
next 1
one 1
She 1
went 1
and 1
got 1
the 1
lump 1
of 1
lead 1
and 1
fetched 1
it 1
back 1
and 1
brought 1
along 1
a 1
hank 1
of 1
yarn 1
which 1
she 1
wanted 1
me 1
to 1
help 1
her 1
with 1
I 1
held 1
up 1
my 1
two 1
hands 1
and 1
she 1
put 1
the 1
hank 1
over 1
them 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
talking 1
about 1
her 1
and 1
her 1
husband 1
s 1
matters 1
But 1
she 1
broke 1
off 1
to 1
say 1
Keep 1
your 1
eye 1
on 1
the 1
rats 1
You 1
better 1
have 1
the 1
lead 1
in 1
your 1
lap 1
handy 1
So 1
she 1
dropped 1
the 1
lump 1
into 1
my 1
lap 1
just 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
and 1
I 1
clapped 1
my 1
legs 1
together 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
she 1
went 1
on 1
talking 1
But 1
only 1
about 1
a 1
minute 1
Then 1
she 1
took 1
off 1
the 1
hank 1
and 1
looked 1
me 1
straight 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
and 1
very 1
pleasant 1
and 1
says 1
Come 1
now 1
what 1
s 1
your 1
real 1
name 1
Wh 1
what 1
mum 1
What 1
s 1
your 1
real 1
name 1
Is 1
it 1
Bill 1
or 1
Tom 1
or 1
Bob 1
or 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
shook 1
like 1
a 1
leaf 1
and 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1

breast 1
and 1
tell 1
her 1
everything 1
but 1
she 1
musn 1
t 1
go 1
back 1
on 1
her 1
promise 1
Then 1
I 1
told 1
her 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
mother 1
was 1
dead 1
and 1
the 1
law 1
had 1
bound 1
me 1
out 1
to 1
a 1
mean 1
old 1
farmer 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
thirty 1
mile 1
back 1
from 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
he 1
treated 1
me 1
so 1
bad 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
stand 1
it 1
no 1
longer 1
he 1
went 1
away 1
to 1
be 1
gone 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
days 1
and 1
so 1
I 1
took 1
my 1
chance 1
and 1
stole 1
some 1
of 1
his 1
daughter 1
s 1
old 1
clothes 1
and 1
cleared 1
out 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
three 1
nights 1
coming 1
the 1
thirty 1
miles 1
I 1
traveled 1
nights 1
and 1
hid 1
daytimes 1
and 1
slept 1
and 1
the 1
bag 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
meat 1
I 1
carried 1
from 1
home 1
lasted 1
me 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
plenty 1
I 1
said 1
I 1
believed 1
my 1
uncle 1
Abner 1
Moore 1
would 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
me 1
and 1
so 1
that 1
was 1
why 1
I 1
struck 1
out 1
for 1

as 1
I 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
turn 1
into 1
the 1
woods 1
for 1
my 1
regular 1
sleep 1
He 1
told 1

roads 1
forked 1

must 1
take 1
the 1
right 1
hand 1
and 1
five 1
mile 1

He 1
was 1
drunk 1
I 1
reckon 1
He 1
told 1
you 1
just 1
exactly 1
wrong 1
Well 1
he 1
did 1
act 1
like 1

was 1
drunk 1

calico 1
You 1
do 1
a 1
girl 1
tolerable 1
poor 1
but 1
you 1
might 1
fool 1
men 1
maybe 1
Bless 1

child 1
when 1
you 1
set 1
out 1
to 1
thread 1
a 1
needle 1
don 1
t 1
hold 1
the 1
thread 1
still 1
and 1
fetch 1
the 1
needle 1
up 1
to 1
it 1
hold 1
the 1
needle 1
still 1
and 1
poke 1
the 1
thread 1
at 1
it 1
that 1
s 1
the 1
way 1
a 1
woman 1
most 1
always 1
does 1
but 1
a 1
man 1
always 1
does 1
t 1
other 1
way 1
And 1
when 1
you 1
throw 1
at 1
a 1
rat 1
or 1
anything 1
hitch 1
yourself 1
up 1
a 1
tiptoe 1
and 1
fetch 1
your 1
hand 1
up 1
over 1
your 1
head 1
as 1
awkward 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
and 1
miss 1
your 1
rat 1
about 1
six 1
or 1
seven 1
foot 1
Throw 1
stiff 1
armed 1
from 1
the 1
shoulder 1
like 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
pivot 1
there 1
for 1
it 1
to 1
turn 1
on 1
like 1
a 1
girl 1
not 1
from 1
the 1
wrist 1
and 1
elbow 1
with 1
your 1
arm 1
out 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
like 1
a 1
boy 1
And 1
mind 1
you 1
when 1
a 1
girl 1
tries 1
to 1
catch 1
anything 1
in 1
her 1
lap 1
she 1
throws 1
her 1
knees 1
apart 1
she 1
don 1
t 1
clap 1
them 1
together 1
the 1
way 1
you 1
did 1
when 1
you 1
catched 1
the 1
lump 1
of 1
lead 1
Why 1
I 1
spotted 1
you 1
for 1
a 1
boy 1
when 1
you 1
was 1
threading 1
the 1
needle 1
and 1
I 1
contrived 1
the 1
other 1
things 1
just 1
to 1
make 1
certain 1
Now 1
trot 1
along 1
to 1
your 1
uncle 1
Sarah 1
Mary 1
Williams 1
George 1
Elexander 1
Peters 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
get 1
into 1
trouble 1
you 1
send 1
word 1
to 1
Mrs 1
Judith 1
Loftus 1
which 1
is 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
ll 1
do 1
what 1
I 1
can 1
to 1
get 1
you 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
Keep 1
the 1
river 1
road 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
and 1
next 1
time 1
you 1
tramp 1
take 1
shoes 1
and 1
socks 1
with 1
you 1
The 1
river 1
road 1
s 1
a 1
rocky 1
one 1
and 1
your 1
feet 1
ll 1
be 1
in 1
a 1
condition 1
when 1
you 1
get 1
to 1
Goshen 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
went 1
up 1
the 1
bank 1
about 1
fifty 1
yards 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
doubled 1
on 1
my 1
tracks 1
and 1
slipped 1
back 1
to 1
where 1
my 1
canoe 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
piece 1
below 1
the 1
house 1
I 1
jumped 1
in 1
and 1
was 1
off 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
I 1
went 1
up 1
stream 1
far 1
enough 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
and 1
then 1
started 1
across 1
I 1
took 1
off 1
the 1
sun 1
bonnet 1
for 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
no 1
blinders 1
on 1
then 1
When 1
I 1
was 1
about 1
the 1
middle 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
clock 1
begin 1
to 1
strike 1
so 1
I 1
stops 1
and 1
listens 1
the 1
sound 1
come 1
faint 1
over 1
the 1
water 1
but 1
clear 1
eleven 1
When 1
I 1
struck 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
I 1
never 1
waited 1
to 1
blow 1
though 1
I 1
was 1
most 1
winded 1
but 1
I 1
shoved 1
right 1
into 1
the 1
timber 1
where 1
my 1
old 1
camp 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
and 1
started 1
a 1
good 1
fire 1
there 1
on 1
a 1
high 1
and 1
dry 1
spot 1
Then 1
I 1
jumped 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
dug 1
out 1
for 1
our 1
place 1
a 1
mile 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
below 1
as 1
hard 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
go 1
I 1
landed 1
and 1
slopped 1
through 1
the 1
timber 1
and 1
up 1
the 1
ridge 1
and 1
into 1
the 1
cavern 1
There 1
Jim 1
laid 1
sound 1
asleep 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
I 1
roused 1
him 1
out 1
and 1
says 1
Git 1
up 1
and 1
hump 1
yourself 1
Jim 1
There 1
ain 1
t 1
a 1
minute 1
to 1
lose 1
They 1
re 1
after 1
us 1
Jim 1
never 1
asked 1
no 1
questions 1
he 1
never 1
said 1
a 1
word 1
but 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
worked 1
for 1
the 1
next 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
showed 1
about 1
how 1
he 1
was 1
scared 1
By 1
that 1
time 1
everything 1
we 1
had 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
was 1
on 1
our 1
raft 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
ready 1
to 1
be 1
shoved 1
out 1
from 1
the 1
willow 1
cove 1
where 1
she 1
was 1
hid 1
We 1
put 1
out 1
the 1
camp 1
fire 1
at 1
the 1
cavern 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
show 1
a 1
candle 1
outside 1
after 1
that 1
I 1
took 1
the 1
canoe 1
out 1
from 1
the 1
shore 1
a 1
little 1
piece 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
look 1
but 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
boat 1
around 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
it 1
for 1
stars 1
and 1
shadows 1
ain 1
t 1
good 1
to 1
see 1
by 1
Then 1
we 1
got 1
out 1
the 1
raft 1
and 1
slipped 1
along 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
shade 1
past 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
dead 1
still 1
never 1
saying 1
a 1
word 1
CHAPTER 1
XII 1
IT 1
must 1
a 1
been 1
close 1
on 1
to 1
one 1
o 1
clock 1
when 1
we 1
got 1
below 1
the 1
island 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
the 1
raft 1
did 1
seem 1
to 1
go 1
mighty 1
slow 1
If 1
a 1
boat 1
was 1
to 1
come 1
along 1
we 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
take 1
to 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
break 1
for 1
the 1
Illinois 1
shore 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
well 1
a 1
boat 1
didn 1
t 1
come 1
for 1
we 1
hadn 1
t 1
ever 1
thought 1
to 1
put 1
the 1
gun 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
or 1
a 1
fishing 1
line 1
or 1
anything 1
to 1
eat 1
We 1
was 1
in 1
ruther 1
too 1
much 1
of 1
a 1
sweat 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
so 1
many 1
things 1
It 1
warn 1
t 1
good 1
judgment 1
to 1
put 1
everything 1
on 1
the 1
raft 1
If 1
the 1
men 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
island 1
I 1
just 1
expect 1
they 1
found 1
the 1
camp 1
fire 1
I 1
built 1
and 1
watched 1
it 1
all 1
night 1
for 1
Jim 1
to 1
come 1
Anyways 1
they 1
stayed 1
away 1
from 1
us 1
and 1
if 1
my 1
building 1
the 1
fire 1
never 1
fooled 1
them 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
fault 1
of 1
mine 1
I 1
played 1
it 1
as 1
low 1
down 1
on 1
them 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
When 1
the 1
first 1
streak 1
of 1
day 1
began 1
to 1
show 1
we 1
tied 1
up 1
to 1
a 1
towhead 1
in 1
a 1
big 1
bend 1
on 1
the 1
Illinois 1
side 1
and 1
hacked 1
off 1
cottonwood 1
branches 1
with 1
the 1
hatchet 1
and 1
covered 1
up 1
the 1
raft 1
with 1
them 1
so 1
she 1
looked 1
like 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
cave 1
in 2
the 1
bank 1
there 1
A 1
tow 1
head 1
is 1
a 1
sandbar 1
that 1
has 1
cottonwoods 1
on 1
it 1
as 1
thick 1
as 1
harrow 1
teeth 1
We 1
had 1
mountains 1
on 1
the 1
Missouri 1
shore 1
and 1
heavy 1
timber 1
on 1
the 1
Illinois 1
side 1
and 1
the 1
channel 1
was 1
down 1
the 1
Missouri 1
shore 1
at 1
that 1
place 1
so 1
we 1
warn 1
t 1
afraid 1
of 1
anybody 1
running 1
across 1
us 1
We 1
laid 1
there 1
all 1
day 1
and 1
watched 1
the 1
rafts 1
and 1
steamboats 1
spin 1
down 1
the 1
Missouri 1
shore 1
and 1
up 1
bound 1
steamboats 1
fight 1
the 1
big 1
river 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
I 1
told 1
Jim 1
all 1
about 1
the 1
time 1
I 1
had 1
jabbering 1
with 1
that 1
woman 1
and 1
Jim 1
said 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
smart 1
one 1
and 1
if 1
she 1
was 1
to 1
start 1
after 1
us 1
herself 1
she 1
wouldn 1
t 1
set 1
down 1
and 1
watch 1
a 1
camp 1
fire 1
no 1
sir 1
she 1
d 1
fetch 1
a 1
dog 1
Well 1
then 1
I 1
said 1
why 1
couldn 1
t 1
she 1
tell 1
her 1
husband 1
to 1
fetch 1
a 1
dog 1
Jim 1
said 1
he 1
bet 1
she 1
did 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
the 1
men 1
was 1
ready 1
to 1
start 1
and 1
he 1
believed 1
they 1
must 1
a 1
gone 1
up 1
town 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
dog 1
and 1
so 1
they 1
lost 1
all 1
that 1
time 1
or 1
else 1
we 1
wouldn 1
t 1
be 1
here 1
on 1
a 1
towhead 1
sixteen 1
or 1
seventeen 1
mile 1
below 1
the 1
village 1
no 1
indeedy 1
we 1
would 1
be 1
in 1
that 1
same 1
old 1
town 1
again 1
So 1
I 1
said 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
care 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
reason 1
they 1
didn 1
t 1
get 1
us 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
they 1
didn 1
t 1
When 1
it 1
was 1
beginning 1
to 1
come 1
on 1
dark 1
we 1
poked 1
our 1
heads 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
cottonwood 1
thicket 1
and 1
looked 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
and 1
across 1
nothing 1
in 1
sight 1
so 1
Jim 1
took 1
up 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
top 1
planks 1
of 1
the 1
raft 1
and 1
built 1
a 1
snug 1
wigwam 1
to 1
get 1
under 1
in 1
blazing 1
weather 1
and 1
rainy 1
and 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
things 1
dry 1
Jim 1
made 1
a 1
floor 1
for 1
the 1
wigwam 1
and 1
raised 1
it 1
a 1
foot 1
or 1
more 1
above 1
the 1
level 1
of 1
the 1
raft 1
so 1
now 1
the 1
blankets 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
traps 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
reach 1
of 1
steamboat 1
waves 1
Right 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
wigwam 1
we 1
made 1
a 1
layer 1
of 1
dirt 1
about 1
five 1
or 1
six 1
inches 1
deep 1
with 1
a 1
frame 1
around 1
it 1
for 1
to 1
hold 1
it 1
to 1
its 1
place 1
this 1
was 1
to 1
build 1
a 1
fire 1
on 1
in 1
sloppy 1
weather 1
or 1
chilly 1
the 1
wigwam 1
would 1
keep 1
it 1
from 1
being 1
seen 1
We 1
made 1
an 1
extra 1
steering 1
oar 1
too 1
because 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
others 1
might 1
get 1
broke 1
on 1
a 1
snag 1
or 1
something 1
We 1
fixed 1
up 1
a 1
short 1
forked 1
stick 1
to 1
hang 1
the 1
old 1
lantern 1
on 1
because 1
we 1
must 1
always 1
light 1
the 1
lantern 1
whenever 1
we 1
see 1
a 1
steamboat 1
coming 1
down 1
stream 1
to 1
keep 1
from 1
getting 1
run 1
over 1
but 1
we 1
wouldn 1
t 1
have 1
to 1
light 1
it 1
for 1
up 1
stream 1
boats 1
unless 1
we 1
see 1
we 1
was 1
in 1
what 1
they 1
call 1
a 1
crossing 1
for 1
the 1
river 1
was 1
pretty 1
high 1
yet 1
very 1
low 1
banks 1
being 1
still 1
a 1
little 1
under 1
water 1
so 1
up 1
bound 1
boats 1
didn 1
t 1
always 1
run 1
the 1
channel 1
but 1
hunted 1
easy 1
water 1
This 1
second 1
night 1
we 1
run 1
between 1
seven 1
and 1
eight 1
hours 1
with 1
a 1
current 1
that 1
was 1
making 1
over 1
four 1
mile 1
an 1
hour 1
We 1
catched 1
fish 1
and 1
talked 1
and 1
we 1
took 1
a 1
swim 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
keep 1
off 1
sleepiness 1
It 1
was 1
kind 1
of 1
solemn 1
drifting 1
down 1
the 1
big 1
still 1
river 1
laying 1
on 1
our 1
backs 1
looking 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
stars 1
and 1
we 1
didn 1
t 1
ever 1
feel 1
like 1
talking 1
loud 1
and 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
often 1
that 1
we 1
laughed 1
only 1
a 1
little 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
low 1
chuckle 1
We 1
had 1
mighty 1
good 1
weather 1
as 1
a 1
general 1
thing 1
and 1
nothing 1
ever 1
happened 1
to 1
us 1
at 1
all 1
that 1
night 1
nor 1
the 1
next 1
nor 1
the 1
next 1
Every 1
night 1
we 1
passed 1
towns 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
away 1
up 1
on 1
black 1
hillsides 1
nothing 1
but 1
just 1
a 1
shiny 1
bed 1
of 1
lights 1
not 1
a 1
house 1
could 1
you 1
see 1
The 1
fifth 1
night 1
we 1
passed 1
St 1
Louis 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
like 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
lit 1
up 1
In 1
St 1
Petersburg 1
they 1
used 1
to 1
say 1
there 1
was 1
twenty 1
or 1
thirty 1
thousand 1
people 1
in 1
St 1
Louis 1
but 1
I 1
never 1
believed 1
it 1
till 1
I 1
see 1
that 1
wonderful 1
spread 1
of 1
lights 1
at 1
two 1
o 1
clock 1
that 1
still 1
night 1
There 1
warn 1
t 1
a 1
sound 1
there 1
everybody 1
was 1
asleep 1
Every 1
night 1
now 1
I 1
used 1
to 1
slip 1
ashore 1
towards 1
ten 1
o 1
clock 1
at 1
some 1
little 1
village 1
and 1
buy 1
ten 1
or 1
fifteen 1
cents 1
worth 1
of 1
meal 1
or 1
bacon 1
or 1
other 1
stuff 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
sometimes 1
I 1
lifted 1
a 1
chicken 1
that 1
warn 1
t 1
roosting 1
comfortable 1
and 1
took 1
him 1
along 1
Pap 1
always 1
said 1
take 1
a 1
chicken 1
when 1
you 1
get 1
a 1
chance 1
because 1
if 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
him 1
yourself 1
you 1
can 1
easy 1
find 1
somebody 1
that 1
does 1
and 1
a 1
good 1
deed 1
ain 1
t 1
ever 1
forgot 1
I 1
never 1
see 1
pap 1
when 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
the 1
chicken 1
himself 1
but 1
that 1
is 1
what 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
say 1
anyway 1
Mornings 1
before 1
daylight 1
I 1
slipped 1
into 1
cornfields 1
and 1
borrowed 1
a 1
watermelon 1
or 1
a 1
mushmelon 1
or 1
a 1
punkin 1
or 1
some 1
new 1
corn 1
or 1
things 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
Pap 1
always 1
said 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
harm 1
to 1
borrow 1
things 1
if 1
you 1
was 1
meaning 1
to 1
pay 1
them 1
back 1
some 1
time 1
but 1
the 1
widow 1
said 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
anything 1
but 1
a 1
soft 1
name 1
for 1
stealing 1
and 1
no 1
decent 1
body 1
would 1
do 1
it 1
Jim 1
said 1
he 1
reckoned 1
the 1
widow 1
was 1
partly 1
right 1
and 1
pap 1
was 1
partly 1
right 1
so 1
the 1
best 1
way 1
would 1
be 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
pick 1
out 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
things 1
from 1
the 1
list 1
and 1
say 1
we 1
wouldn 1
t 1
borrow 1
them 1
any 1
more 1
then 1
he 1
reckoned 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
be 1
no 1
harm 1
to 1
borrow 1
the 1
others 1
So 1
we 1
talked 1
it 1
over 1
all 1
one 1
night 1
drifting 1
along 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
trying 1
to 1
make 1
up 1
our 1
minds 1
whether 1
to 1
drop 1
the 1
watermelons 1
or 1
the 1
cantelopes 1
or 1
the 1
mushmelons 1
or 1
what 1
But 1
towards 1
daylight 1
we 1
got 1
it 1
all 1
settled 1
satisfactory 1
and 1
concluded 1
to 1
drop 1
crabapples 1
and 1
p 1
simmons 1
We 1
warn 1
t 1
feeling 1
just 1
right 1
before 1
that 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
comfortable 1
now 1
I 1
was 1
glad 1
the 1
way 1
it 1
come 1
out 1
too 1
because 1
crabapples 1
ain 1
t 1
ever 1
good 1
and 1
the 1
p 1
simmons 1
wouldn 1
t 1
be 1
ripe 1
for 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
months 1
yet 1
We 1
shot 1
a 1
water 1
fowl 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
that 1
got 1
up 1
too 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
or 1
didn 1
t 1
go 1
to 1
bed 1
early 1
enough 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
Take 1
it 1
all 1
round 1
we 1
lived 1
pretty 1
high 1
The 1
fifth 1
night 1
below 1
St 1
Louis 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
big 1
storm 1
after 1
midnight 1
with 1
a 1
power 1
of 1
thunder 1
and 1
lightning 1
and 1
the 1
rain 1
poured 1
down 1
in 1
a 1
solid 1
sheet 1
We 1
stayed 1
in 1
the 1
wigwam 1
and 1
let 1
the 1
raft 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
itself 1
When 1
the 1
lightning 1
glared 1
out 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
a 1
big 1
straight 1
river 1
ahead 1
and 1
high 1
rocky 1
bluffs 1
on 1
both 1
sides 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
says 1
I 1
Hel 1
lo 1
Jim 1
looky 1
yonder 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
steamboat 1
that 1
had 1
killed 1
herself 1
on 1
a 1
rock 1
We 1
was 1
drifting 1
straight 1
down 1
for 1
her 1
The 1
lightning 1
showed 1
her 1
very 1
distinct 1
She 1
was 1
leaning 1
over 1
with 1
part 1
of 1
her 1
upper 1
deck 1
above 1
water 1
and 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
every 1
little 1
chimbly 1
guy 1
clean 1
and 1
clear 1
and 1
a 1
chair 1
by 1
the 1
big 1
bell 1
with 1
an 1
old 1
slouch 1
hat 1
hanging 1
on 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
it 1
when 1
the 1
flashes 1
come 1
Well 1
it 1
being 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
and 1
stormy 1
and 1
all 1
so 1
mysterious 1
like 1
I 1
felt 1
just 1
the 1
way 1
any 1
other 1
boy 1
would 1
a 1
felt 1
when 1
I 1
see 1
that 1
wreck 1
laying 1
there 1
so 1
mournful 1
and 1
lonesome 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
get 1
aboard 1
of 1
her 1
and 1
slink 1
around 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
see 1
what 1
there 1
was 1
there 1
So 1
I 1
says 1
Le 1
s 1
land 1
on 1
her 1
Jim 1
But 1
Jim 1
was 1
dead 1
against 1
it 1
at 1
first 1
He 1
says 1
I 1
doan 1
want 1
to 1
go 1

er 1

book 1
says 1
Like 1
as 1

Watchman 1

says 1

but 1
the 1
texas 1
and 1
the 1
pilot 1
house 1
and 1
do 1
you 1
reckon 1
anybody 1

going 1
to 1
resk 1
his 1
life 1
for 1
a 1
texas 1
and 1
a 1
pilot 1
house 1
such 1
a 1
night 1
as 1
this 1
when 1
it 1
s 1
likely 1
to 1
break 1
up 1
and 1
wash 1
off 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
any 1
minute 1
Jim 1
couldn 1
t 1
say 1
nothing 1
to 1
that 1
so 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
try 1
And 1
besides 1
I 1
says 1
we 1
might 1
borrow 1
something 1
worth 1
having 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
captain 1
s 1
stateroom 1
Seegars 1
I 1
bet 1
you 1
and 1
cost 1
five 1
cents 1
apiece 1
solid 1
cash 1
Steamboat 1
captains 1
is 1
always 1
rich 1
and 1
get 1
sixty 1
dollars 1
a 1
month 1
and 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
a 1
cent 1
what 1
a 1
thing 1
costs 1
you 1
know 1
long 1
as 1
they 1
want 1
it 1
Stick 1
a 1
candle 1
in 1
your 1
pocket 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
rest 1
Jim 1
till 1
we 1
give 1
her 1
a 1
rummaging 1
Do 1
you 1
reckon 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
would 1
ever 1
go 1
by 1
this 1
thing 1
Not 1
for 1
pie 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
He 1
d 1
call 1
it 1
an 1
adventure 1
that 1
s 1
what 1
he 1
d 1
call 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
d 1
land 1
on 1
that 1
wreck 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
last 1
act 1
And 1
wouldn 1
t 1
he 1
throw 1
style 1
into 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
he 1
spread 1
himself 1
nor 1
nothing 1
Why 1
you 1
d 1
think 1
it 1
was 1
Christopher 1
C 1
lumbus 1
discovering 1
Kingdom 1
Come 1
I 1
wish 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
was 1
here 1
Jim 1
he 1
grumbled 1
a 1
little 1
but 1
give 1
in 1
He 1
said 1
we 1
mustn 1
t 1
talk 1
any 1
more 1
than 1
we 1
could 1
help 1
and 1
then 1
talk 1
mighty 1
low 1
The 1
lightning 1
showed 1
us 1
the 1
wreck 1
again 1
just 1
in 1
time 1
and 1
we 1
fetched 1
the 1
stabboard 1
derrick 1
and 1
made 1
fast 1
there 1
The 1
deck 1
was 1
high 1
out 1
here 1
We 1
went 1
sneaking 1
down 1
the 1
slope 1
of 1
it 1
to 1
labboard 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
towards 1
the 1
texas 1
feeling 1
our 1
way 1
slow 1
with 1
our 1
feet 1
and 1
spreading 1
our 1
hands 1
out 1
to 1
fend 1
off 1
the 1
guys 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
dark 1
we 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
them 1
Pretty 1
soon 1
we 1
struck 1
the 1
forward 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
skylight 1
and 1
clumb 1
on 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
step 1
fetched 1
us 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
captain 1
s 1
door 1
which 1
was 1
open 1
and 1
by 1
Jimminy 1
away 1
down 1
through 1
the 1
texas 1
hall 1
we 1
see 1
a 1
light 1
and 1
all 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
second 1
we 1
seem 1
to 1
hear 1
low 1
voices 1
in 1
yonder 1
Jim 1
whispered 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
feeling 1
powerful 1
sick 1
and 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
come 1
along 1
I 1
says 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
start 1
for 1
the 1
raft 1
but 1
just 1
then 1
I 1
heard 1
a 1
voice 1
wail 1
out 1
and 1
say 1
Oh 1
please 1
don 1
t 1
boys 1
I 1
swear 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
ever 1
tell 1
Another 1
voice 1
said 1
pretty 1
loud 1
It 1
s 1
a 1
lie 1
Jim 1
Turner 1
You 1
ve 1
acted 1
this 1
way 1
before 1
You 1
always 1
want 1
more 1
n 1
your 1
share 1
of 1
the 1
truck 1
and 1
you 1
ve 1
always 1
got 1
it 1
too 1
because 1
you 1
ve 1
swore 1
t 1
if 1
you 1
didn 1
t 1
you 1
d 1
tell 1
But 1
this 1
time 1
you 1
ve 1
said 1
it 1
jest 1
one 1
time 1
too 1
many 1
You 1
re 1
the 1
meanest 1
treacherousest 1
hound 1
in 1
this 1
country 1
By 1
this 1
time 1
Jim 1
was 1
gone 1
for 1
the 1
raft 1
I 1
was 1
just 1
a 1
biling 1
with 1
curiosity 1
and 1
I 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
wouldn 1
t 1

and 1
so 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
either 1

going 1
to 1

going 1
on 1
here 1
So 1
I 1
dropped 1
on 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
knees 1
in 1
the 1
little 1
passage 1
and 1
crept 1

Then 1
in 1

man 1

on 1

floor 1
and 1

and 1

and 1
two 1
men 1

and 1
one 1
of 1
them 1

a 1
dim 1
lantern 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
one 1
had 1
a 1
pistol 1
This 1
one 1
kept 1
pointing 1

pistol 1
at 1

The 1

say 1
Oh 1

says 1
the 1
man 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
sort 1
of 1
blubbering 1
Packard 1
didn 1
t 1
take 1
no 1
notice 1
of 1
that 1
but 1
hung 1
up 1
his 1
lantern 1
on 1
a 1
nail 1
and 1
started 1
towards 1
where 1
I 1
was 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
and 1
motioned 1
Bill 1
to 1
come 1
I 1
crawfished 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
about 1
two 1
yards 1
but 1
the 1
boat 1
slanted 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
make 1
very 1
good 1
time 1
so 1
to 1
keep 1
from 1
getting 1
run 1
over 1
and 1
catched 1
I 1
crawled 1
into 1
a 1
stateroom 1
on 1
the 1
upper 1
side 1
The 1
man 1
came 1
a 1
pawing 1
along 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
and 1
when 1
Packard 1
got 1
to 1
my 1
stateroom 1
he 1
says 1
Here 1
come 1
in 1
here 1
And 1
in 1
he 1
come 1
and 1
Bill 1
after 1
him 1
But 1
before 1
they 1
got 1
in 1
I 1
was 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
upper 1
berth 1
cornered 1
and 1
sorry 1
I 1
come 1
Then 1
they 1
stood 1
there 1
with 1
their 1
hands 1
on 1
the 1
ledge 1
of 1
the 1
berth 1
and 1
talked 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
them 1
but 1
I 1
could 1
tell 1
where 1
they 1
was 1
by 1
the 1
whisky 1
they 1
d 1
been 1
having 1
I 1
was 1
glad 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
drink 1
whisky 1
but 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
made 1
much 1
difference 1
anyway 1
because 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
they 1
couldn 1
t 1
a 1
treed 1
me 1
because 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
breathe 1
I 1
was 1
too 1
scared 1
And 1
besides 1
a 1
body 1
couldn 1
t 1
breathe 1
and 1
hear 1
such 1
talk 1
They 1
talked 1
low 1
and 1
earnest 1
Bill 1
wanted 1
to 1
kill 1
Turner 1
He 1
says 1
He 1
s 1
said 1
he 1
ll 1
tell 1
and 1
he 1
will 1
If 1
we 1
was 1
to 1
give 1
both 1
our 1
shares 1
to 1
him 1
now 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
make 1
no 1
difference 1
after 1
the 1
row 1
and 1
the 1
way 1
we 1
ve 1
served 1
him 1
Shore 1
s 1
you 1
re 1
born 1
he 1
ll 1
turn 1
State 1
s 1
evidence 1
now 1
you 1
hear 1
me 1
I 1
m 1
for 1
putting 1
him 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
troubles 1
So 1
m 1
I 1
says 1
Packard 1
very 1
quiet 1
Blame 1
it 1
I 1
d 1
sorter 1
begun 1
to 1
think 1
you 1
wasn 1
t 1
Well 1
then 1
that 1
s 1
all 1
right 1
Le 1
s 1
go 1
and 1
do 1
it 1
Hold 1
on 1
a 1
minute 1
I 1
hain 1
t 1
had 1
my 1
say 1
yit 1
You 1
listen 1
to 1
me 1
Shooting 1
s 1
good 1
but 1
there 1
s 1
quieter 1
ways 1
if 1
the 1
thing 1
s 1
got 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
But 1
what 1
I 1
say 1
is 1
this 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
good 1
sense 1
to 1
go 1
court 1
n 1
around 1
after 1
a 1
halter 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
git 1
at 1
what 1
you 1
re 1
up 1
to 1
in 1
some 1
way 1
that 1
s 1
jist 1
as 1
good 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
don 1
t 1
bring 1
you 1
into 1
no 1
resks 1
Ain 1
t 1
that 1
so 1
You 1
bet 1
it 1
is 1
But 1
how 1
you 1
goin 1
to 1
manage 1
it 1
this 1
time 1
Well 1
my 1
idea 1
is 1
this 1
we 1
ll 1
rustle 1
around 1
and 1
gather 1
up 1
whatever 1
pickins 1
we 1
ve 1
overlooked 1
in 1
the 1
staterooms 1
and 1
shove 1
for 1
shore 1
and 1
hide 1
the 1
truck 1
Then 1
we 1
ll 1
wait 1
Now 1
I 1
say 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
a 1
goin 1
to 1
be 1
more 1
n 1
two 1
hours 1
befo 1
this 1
wrack 1
breaks 1
up 1
and 1
washes 1
off 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
See 1
He 1
ll 1
be 1
drownded 1
and 1
won 1
t 1
have 1
nobody 1
to 1
blame 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
his 1
own 1
self 1
I 1
reckon 1
that 1
s 1
a 1
considerble 1
sight 1
better 1
n 1
killin 1
of 1
him 1
I 1
m 1
unfavorable 1
to 1
killin 1
a 1
man 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
git 1
aroun 1
it 2
ain 1
t 1
good 1
sense 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
good 1
morals 1
Ain 1
t 1
I 1
right 1
Yes 1
I 1
reck 1
n 1
you 1
are 1
But 1
s 1
pose 1
she 1
don 1
t 1
break 1
up 1
and 1
wash 1
off 1
Well 1
we 1
can 1
wait 1
the 1
two 1
hours 1
anyway 1
and 1
see 1
can 1
t 1
we 1
All 1
right 1
then 1
come 1
along 1
So 1
they 1
started 1
and 1
I 1
lit 1
out 1
all 1
in 1
a 1
cold 1
sweat 1
and 1
scrambled 1
forward 1
It 1
was 1
dark 1
as 1
pitch 1
there 1
but 1
I 1
said 1
in 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
coarse 1
whisper 1
Jim 1
and 1
he 1
answered 1
up 1
right 1
at 1
my 1
elbow 1
with 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
a 1
moan 1
and 1
I 1
says 1
Quick 1
Jim 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
time 1
for 1
fooling 1
around 1
and 1
moaning 1
there 1

gang 1
of 1
murderers 1
in 1
yonder 1
and 1
if 1
we 1
don 1
t 1

up 1
their 1
boat 1
and 1
set 1
her 1
drifting 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
so 1
these 1
fellows 1
can 1
t 1
get 1
away 1
from 1

wreck 1
there 1
s 1
one 1
of 1
em 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
a 1
bad 1

But 1
if 1
we 1
find 1
their 1
boat 1
we 1
can 1
put 1
all 1
of 1
em 1
in 1

Quick 1

You 1

CHAPTER 1
XIII 1
WELL 1
I 1
catched 1
my 1
breath 1
and 1
most 1
fainted 1
Shut 1
up 1
on 1
a 1
wreck 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
gang 1
as 1
that 1
But 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
be 1
sentimentering 1
We 1
d 1
got 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
boat 1
now 1
had 1
to 1
have 1
it 1
for 1
ourselves 1
So 1
we 1
went 1
a 1
quaking 1
and 1
shaking 1
down 1
the 1
stabboard 1
side 1
and 1
slow 1
work 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
seemed 1
a 1
week 1
before 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
stern 1
No 1
sign 1
of 1
a 1
boat 1
Jim 1
said 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
believe 1
he 1
could 1
go 1
any 1
further 1
so 1
scared 1
he 1
hadn 1
t 1
hardly 1
any 1
strength 1
left 1
he 1
said 1
But 1
I 1
said 1
come 1
on 1
if 1
we 1
get 1
left 1
on 1
this 1
wreck 1
we 1
are 1
in 1
a 1
fix 1
sure 1
So 1
on 1
we 1
prowled 1
again 1
We 1
struck 1
for 1
the 1
stern 1
of 1
the 1
texas 1
and 1
found 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
scrabbled 1
along 1
forwards 1
on 1
the 1
skylight 1
hanging 1
on 1
from 1
shutter 1
to 1
shutter 1
for 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
skylight 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
When 1
we 1
got 1
pretty 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
cross 1
hall 1
door 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
skiff 1
sure 1
enough 1
I 1
could 1
just 1
barely 1
see 1
her 1
I 1
felt 1
ever 1
so 1
thankful 1
In 1
another 1
second 1
I 1
would 1
a 1
been 1
aboard 1
of 1
her 1
but 1
just 1
then 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
One 1
of 1
the 1
men 1
stuck 1
his 1
head 1
out 1
only 1
about 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
foot 1
from 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
was 1
gone 1
but 1
he 1
jerked 1
it 1
in 1
again 1
and 1
says 1
Heave 1
that 1
blame 1
lantern 1
out 1
o 1
sight 1
Bill 1
He 1
flung 1
a 1
bag 1
of 1
something 1
into 1
the 1
boat 1
and 1
then 1
got 1
in 1
himself 1
and 1
set 1
down 1
It 1
was 1
Packard 1
Then 1
Bill 1
he 1
come 1
out 1
and 1
got 1
in 1
Packard 1
says 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
voice 1
All 1
ready 1
shove 1
off 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
hardly 1
hang 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
shutters 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
weak 1
But 1
Bill 1
says 1
Hold 1
on 1
d 1
you 1
go 1
through 1
him 1
No 1
Didn 1
t 1
you 1
No 1
So 1
he 1
s 1
got 1
his 1
share 1
o 1
the 1
cash 1
yet 1
Well 1
then 1
come 1
along 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
take 1
truck 1
and 1
leave 1
money 1
Say 1
won 1
t 1
he 1
suspicion 1
what 1
we 1
re 1
up 1
to 1
Maybe 1
he 1
won 1
t 1
But 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
have 1
it 1
anyway 1
Come 1
along 1
So 1
they 1
got 1
out 1
and 1
went 1
in 1
The 1
door 1
slammed 1
to 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
careened 1
side 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
half 1
second 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
boat 1
and 1
Jim 1
come 1
tumbling 1
after 1
me 1
I 1
out 1
with 1
my 1
knife 1
and 1
cut 1
the 1
rope 1
and 1
away 1
we 1
went 1
We 1
didn 1
t 1
touch 1
an 1
oar 1
and 1
we 1
didn 1
t 1
speak 1
nor 1
whisper 1
nor 1
hardly 1
even 1
breathe 1
We 1
went 1
gliding 1
swift 1
along 1
dead 1
silent 1
past 1
the 1
tip 1
of 1
the 1
paddle 1
box 1
and 1
past 1
the 1
stern 1
then 1
in 1
a 1
second 1
or 1
two 1
more 1
we 1
was 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
below 1
the 1
wreck 1
and 1
the 1
darkness 1
soaked 1
her 1
up 1
every 1
last 1
sign 1
of 1
her 1
and 1
we 1
was 1
safe 1
and 1
knowed 1
it 1
When 1
we 1
was 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
hundred 1
yards 1
down 1
stream 1
we 1
see 1
the 1
lantern 1
show 1
like 1
a 1
little 1
spark 1
at 1
the 1
texas 1
door 1
for 1
a 1
second 1
and 1
we 1
knowed 1
by 1
that 2
the 1
rascals 1
had 1
missed 1
their 1
boat 1
and 1
was 1
beginning 1
to 1
understand 1
that 1
they 1
was 1
in 1
just 1
as 1
much 1
trouble 1
now 1
as 1
Jim 1
Turner 1
was 1
Then 1
Jim 1
manned 1
the 1
oars 1
and 1
we 1
took 1
out 1
after 1
our 1
raft 1
Now 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
that 1
I 1
begun 1
to 1
worry 1
about 1
the 1
men 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
had 1
time 1
to 1
before 1
I 1
begun 1
to 1
think 1
how 1
dreadful 1
it 1
was 1
even 1
for 1
murderers 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
fix 1
I 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
telling 1
but 1
I 1
might 1
come 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
murderer 1
myself 1
yet 1
and 1
then 1
how 1
would 1
I 1
like 1
it 1
So 1
says 1
I 1
to 1
Jim 1
The 1
first 1
light 1
we 1
see 1
we 1
ll 1
land 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
below 1
it 1
or 1
above 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
place 1
where 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
good 1
hiding 1
place 1
for 1
you 1
and 1
the 1
skiff 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
ll 1
go 1
and 1
fix 1
up 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
yarn 1
and 1
get 1
somebody 1
to 1
go 1
for 1
that 1
gang 1
and 1
get 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
scrape 1
so 1
they 1
can 1
be 1
hung 1
when 1
their 1
time 1
comes 1
But 1
that 1
idea 1
was 1
a 1
failure 1
for 1
pretty 1
soon 1
it 1
begun 1
to 1
storm 1
again 1
and 1
this 1
time 1
worse 1
than 1
ever 1
The 1
rain 1
poured 1
down 1
and 1
never 1
a 1
light 1
showed 1
everybody 1
in 1
bed 1
I 1
reckon 1
We 1
boomed 1
along 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
watching 1
for 1
lights 1
and 1
watching 1
for 1
our 1
raft 1
After 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
the 1
rain 1
let 1
up 1
but 1
the 1
clouds 1
stayed 1
and 1
the 1
lightning 1
kept 1
whimpering 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
a 1
flash 1
showed 1
us 1
a 1
black 1
thing 1
ahead 1
floating 1
and 1
we 1
made 1
for 1
it 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
raft 1
and 1
mighty 1
glad 1
was 1
we 1
to 1
get 1
aboard 1
of 1
it 1
again 1
We 1
seen 1
a 1
light 1
now 1
away 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
on 1
shore 1
So 1
I 1
said 1
I 1
would 1
go 1
for 1
it 1
The 1
skiff 1
was 1
half 1
full 1
of 1
plunder 1
which 1
that 1
gang 1
had 1
stole 1
there 1
on 1
the 1
wreck 1
We 1
hustled 1
it 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
raft 1
in 1
a 1
pile 1
and 1
I 1
told 1
Jim 1
to 1
float 1
along 1
down 1
and 1
show 1
a 1
light 1
when 1
he 1
judged 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
about 1
two 1
mile 1
and 1
keep 1
it 1
burning 1
till 1
I 1
come 1
then 1
I 1
manned 1
my 1
oars 1
and 1
shoved 1
for 1
the 1
light 1
As 1
I 1
got 1
down 1
towards 1
it 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
more 1
showed 1
up 1
on 1
a 1
hillside 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
village 1
I 1
closed 1
in 1
above 1
the 1
shore 1
light 1
and 1
laid 1
on 1
my 1
oars 1
and 1
floated 1
As 1
I 1
went 1
by 1
I 1
see 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
lantern 1
hanging 1
on 1
the 1
jackstaff 1
of 1
a 1
double 1
hull 1
ferryboat 1
I 1
skimmed 1
around 1
for 1
the 1
watchman 1
a 1
wondering 1
whereabouts 1
he 1
slept 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
I 1
found 1
him 1
roosting 1
on 1
the 1
bitts 1
forward 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
down 1
between 1
his 1
knees 1
I 1
gave 1
his 1
shoulder 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
little 1
shoves 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
cry 1
He 1
stirred 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1

startlish 1
way 1
but 1
when 1

Well 1

his 1
niece 1
all 1
safe 1
before 1

town 1
Hump 1
yourself 1
now 1
I 1
m 1
a 1
going 1
up 1
around 1
the 1
corner 1
here 1
to 1
roust 1
out 1
my 1
engineer 1
I 1
struck 1
for 1
the 1
light 1
but 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
turned 1
the 1
corner 1
I 1
went 1
back 1
and 1
got 1
into 1
my 1
skiff 1
and 1
bailed 1
her 1
out 1
and 1
then 1
pulled 1
up 1
shore 1
in 1
the 1
easy 1
water 1
about 1
six 1
hundred 1
yards 1
and 1
tucked 1
myself 1
in 1
among 1
some 1
woodboats 1
for 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
rest 1
easy 1
till 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
start 1
But 1
take 1
it 1
all 1
around 1
I 1
was 1
feeling 1
ruther 1
comfortable 1
on 1
accounts 1
of 1
taking 1
all 1
this 1
trouble 1
for 1
that 1
gang 1
for 1
not 1
many 1
would 1
a 1
done 1
it 1
I 1
wished 1
the 1
widow 1
knowed 1
about 1
it 1
I 1
judged 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
proud 1
of 1
me 1
for 1
helping 1
these 1
rapscallions 1
because 1
rapscallions 1
and 1
dead 1
beats 1
is 1
the 1
kind 1
the 1
widow 1
and 1
good 1
people 1
takes 1
the 1
most 1
interest 1
in 1
Well 1
before 1
long 1
here 1
comes 1
the 1
wreck 1
dim 1
and 1
dusky 1
sliding 1
along 1
down 1
A 1
kind 1
of 1
cold 1
shiver 1
went 1
through 1
me 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
struck 1
out 1
for 1
her 1
She 1
was 1
very 1
deep 1
and 1
I 1
see 1
in 1
a 1
minute 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
much 1
chance 1
for 1
anybody 1
being 1
alive 1
in 1
her 1
I 1
pulled 1
all 1
around 1
her 1
and 1
hollered 1
a 1
little 1
but 1
there 1
wasn 1
t 1
any 1
answer 1
all 1
dead 1
still 1
I 1
felt 1
a 1
little 1
bit 1
heavy 1
hearted 1
about 1
the 1
gang 1
but 1
not 1
much 1
for 1
I 1
reckoned 1
if 1
they 1
could 1
stand 1
it 1
I 1
could 1
Then 1
here 1
comes 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
so 1
I 1
shoved 1
for 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
on 1
a 1
long 1
down 1
stream 1
slant 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
judged 1
I 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
eye 1
reach 1
I 1
laid 1
on 1
my 1
oars 1
and 1
looked 1
back 1
and 1
see 1
her 1
go 1
and 1
smell 1
around 1
the 1
wreck 1
for 1
Miss 1
Hooker 1
s 1
remainders 1
because 1
the 1
captain 1
would 1
know 1
her 1
uncle 1
Hornback 1
would 1
want 1
them 1
and 1
then 1
pretty 1
soon 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
give 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
for 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
I 1
laid 1
into 1
my 1
work 1
and 1
went 1
a 1
booming 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
It 1
did 1
seem 1
a 1
powerful 1
long 1
time 1
before 1
Jim 1
s 1
light 1
showed 1
up 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
did 1
show 1
it 1
looked 1
like 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
thousand 1
mile 1
off 1
By 1
the 1
time 1
I 1
got 1
there 1
the 1
sky 1
was 1
beginning 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
little 1
gray 1
in 1
the 1
east 1
so 1
we 1
struck 1
for 1
an 1
island 1
and 1
hid 1
the 1
raft 1
and 1
sunk 1
the 1
skiff 1
and 1
turned 1
in 1
and 1
slept 1
like 1
dead 1
people 1
CHAPTER 1
XIV 1
BY 1
and 1
by 1
when 1
we 1
got 1
up 1
we 1
turned 1
over 1
the 1
truck 1
the 1
gang 1
had 1
stole 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
wreck 1
and 1
found 1
boots 1
and 1
blankets 1
and 1
clothes 1
and 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
other 1
things 1
and 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
books 1
and 1
a 1
spyglass 1
and 1
three 1
boxes 1
of 1
seegars 1
We 1
hadn 1
t 1
ever 1
been 1
this 1
rich 1
before 1
in 1
neither 1
of 1
our 1
lives 1
The 1
seegars 1
was 1
prime 1
We 1
laid 1
off 1
all 1
the 1
afternoon 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
talking 1
and 1
me 1
reading 1
the 1
books 1
and 1
having 1
a 1
general 1
good 1
time 1
I 1
told 1
Jim 1
all 1
about 1
what 1
happened 1
inside 1
the 1
wreck 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
and 1
I 1
said 1
these 1
kinds 1
of 1
things 1
was 1
adventures 1
but 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
no 1

the 1
line 1
around 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
right 1
on 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
cut 1
bank 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
stiff 1
current 1
and 1
the 1
raft 1
come 1
booming 1
down 1
so 1
lively 1
she 1
tore 1
it 1
out 1
by 1
the 1
roots 1
and 1
away 1
she 1
went 1
I 1
see 1
the 1
fog 1
closing 1
down 1
and 1
it 1
made 1
me 1
so 1
sick 1
and 1
scared 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
budge 1
for 1
most 1
a 1
half 1
a 1
minute 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
then 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
raft 1
in 1
sight 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
twenty 1
yards 1
I 1
jumped 1
into 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
run 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
stern 1
and 1
grabbed 1
the 1
paddle 1
and 1
set 1
her 1
back 1
a 1
stroke 1
But 1
she 1
didn 1
t 1
come 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
hurry 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
untied 1
her 1
I 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
untie 1
her 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
excited 1
my 1
hands 1
shook 1
so 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
hardly 1
do 1
anything 1
with 1
them 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
I 1
got 1
started 1
I 1
took 1
out 1
after 1
the 1
raft 1
hot 1
and 1
heavy 1
right 1
down 1
the 1
towhead 1
That 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
it 1
went 1
but 1
the 1
towhead 1
warn 1
t 1
sixty 1
yards 1
long 1
and 1
the 1
minute 1
I 1
flew 1
by 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
it 1
I 1
shot 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
solid 1
white 1
fog 1
and 1
hadn 1
t 1
no 1
more 1
idea 1
which 1
way 1
I 1
was 1
going 1
than 1
a 1
dead 1
man 1
Thinks 1
I 1
it 1
won 1
t 1
do 1
to 1
paddle 1
first 1
I 1
know 1
I 1
ll 1
run 1
into 1
the 1
bank 1
or 1
a 1
towhead 1
or 1
something 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
set 1
still 1
and 1
float 1
and 1
yet 1
it 1
s 1
mighty 1
fidgety 1
business 1
to 1
have 1
to 1
hold 1
your 1
hands 1
still 1
at 1
such 1
a 1
time 1
I 1
whooped 1
and 1
listened 1
Away 1
down 1
there 1
somewheres 1
I 1
hears 1
a 1
small 1
whoop 1
and 1
up 1
comes 1
my 1
spirits 1
I 1
went 1
tearing 1
after 1
it 1
listening 1
sharp 1
to 1
hear 1
it 1
again 1
The 1
next 1
time 1
it 1
come 1
I 1
see 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
heading 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
heading 1
away 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
of 1
it 1
And 1
the 1
next 1
time 1
I 1
was 1
heading 1
away 1
to 1
the 1
left 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
not 1
gaining 1
on 1
it 1
much 1
either 1
for 1
I 1
was 1
flying 1
around 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
that 1
and 1
t 1
other 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
going 1
straight 1
ahead 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
I 1
did 1
wish 1
the 1
fool 1
would 1
think 1
to 1
beat 1
a 1
tin 1
pan 1
and 1
beat 1
it 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
but 1
he 1
never 1
did 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
still 1
places 1
between 1
the 1
whoops 1
that 1
was 1
making 1
the 1
trouble 1
for 1
me 1
Well 1
I 1
fought 1
along 1
and 1
directly 1
I 1
hears 1
the 1
whoop 1
behind 1
me 1
I 1
was 1
tangled 1
good 1
now 1
That 1
was 1
somebody 1
else 1
s 1
whoop 1
or 1
else 1
I 1
was 1
turned 1
around 1
I 1
throwed 1
the 1
paddle 1
down 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
whoop 1
again 1
it 1
was 1
behind 1
me 1
yet 1
but 1
in 1
a 1
different 1
place 1
it 1
kept 1
coming 1
and 1
kept 1
changing 1
its 1
place 1
and 1
I 1
kept 1
answering 1
till 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
me 1
again 1
and 1
I 1
knowed 1
the 1
current 1
had 1
swung 1
the 1
canoe 1
s 1
head 1
down 1
stream 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
if 1
that 1
was 1
Jim 1
and 1
not 1
some 1
other 1
raftsman 1
hollering 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
tell 1
nothing 1
about 1
voices 1
in 1
a 1
fog 1
for 1
nothing 1
don 1
t 1
look 1
natural 1
nor 1
sound 1
natural 1
in 1
a 1
fog 1
The 1
whooping 1
went 1
on 1
and 1
in 1
about 1
a 1
minute 1
I 1
come 1
a 1
booming 1
down 1
on 1
a 1
cut 1
bank 1
with 1
smoky 1
ghosts 1
of 1
big 1
trees 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
current 1
throwed 1
me 1
off 1
to 1
the 1
left 1
and 1
shot 1
by 1
amongst 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
snags 1
that 1
fairly 1
roared 1
the 1
currrent 1
was 1
tearing 1
by 1
them 1
so 1
swift 1
In 1
another 1
second 1
or 1
two 1
it 1
was 1
solid 1
white 1
and 1
still 1
again 1
I 1
set 1
perfectly 1
still 1
then 1
listening 1
to 1
my 1
heart 1
thump 1
and 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
draw 1
a 1
breath 1
while 1
it 1
thumped 1
a 1
hundred 1
I 1
just 1
give 1
up 1
then 1
I 1
knowed 1
what 1
the 1
matter 1
was 1
That 1
cut 1
bank 1
was 1
an 1
island 1
and 1
Jim 1
had 1
gone 1
down 1
t 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
it 1
It 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
towhead 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
float 1
by 1
in 1
ten 1
minutes 1
It 1
had 1
the 1
big 1
timber 1
of 1
a 1
regular 1
island 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
five 1
or 1
six 1
miles 1
long 1
and 1
more 1
than 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
wide 1
I 1
kept 1
quiet 1
with 1
my 1
ears 1
cocked 1
about 1
fifteen 1
minutes 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
was 1
floating 1
along 1
of 1
course 1
four 1
or 1
five 1
miles 1
an 1
hour 1
but 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
ever 1
think 1
of 1
that 1
No 1
you 1
feel 1
like 1
you 1
are 1
laying 1
dead 1
still 1
on 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
if 1
a 1
little 1
glimpse 1
of 1
a 1
snag 1
slips 1
by 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
to 1
yourself 1
how 1
fast 1
you 1
re 1
going 1
but 1
you 1
catch 1
your 1
breath 1
and 1
think 1
my 1
how 1
that 1
snag 1
s 1
tearing 1
along 1
If 1
you 1
think 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
dismal 1
and 1
lonesome 1
out 1
in 1
a 1
fog 1
that 1
way 1
by 1
yourself 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
you 1
try 1
it 1
once 1
you 1
ll 1
see 1
Next 1
for 1
about 1
a 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
I 1
whoops 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
at 1
last 1
I 1
hears 1
the 1
answer 1
a 1
long 1
ways 1
off 1
and 1
tries 1
to 1
follow 1
it 1
but 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
do 1
it 1
and 1
directly 1
I 1
judged 1
I 1
d 1
got 1
into 1
a 1
nest 1
of 1
towheads 1
for 1
I 1
had 1
little 1
dim 1
glimpses 1
of 1
them 1
on 1
both 1
sides 1
of 1
me 1
sometimes 1
just 1
a 1
narrow 1
channel 1
between 1
and 1
some 1
that 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
I 1
knowed 1
was 1
there 1
because 1
I 1
d 1
hear 1
the 1
wash 1
of 1
the 1
current 1
against 1
the 1
old 1
dead 1
brush 1
and 1
trash 1
that 1
hung 1
over 1
the 1
banks 1
Well 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
long 1
loosing 1
the 1
whoops 1
down 1
amongst 1
the 1
towheads 1
and 1
I 1
only 1
tried 1
to 1
chase 1
them 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
anyway 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
worse 1
than 1
chasing 1
a 1
Jack 1
o 1
lantern 1
You 1
never 1
knowed 1
a 1
sound 1
dodge 1
around 1
so 1
and 1
swap 1
places 1
so 1
quick 1
and 1
so 1
much 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
claw 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
bank 1
pretty 1
lively 1
four 1
or 1
five 1
times 1
to 1
keep 1
from 1
knocking 1
the 1
islands 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
so 1
I 1
judged 1
the 1
raft 1
must 1
be 1
butting 1
into 1
the 1
bank 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
or 1
else 1
it 1
would 1
get 1
further 1
ahead 1
and 1
clear 1
out 1
of 1
hearing 1
it 1
was 1
floating 1
a 1
little 1
faster 1
than 1
what 1
I 1
was 1
Well 1
I 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
river 1
again 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
but 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
hear 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
a 1
whoop 1
nowheres 1
I 1
reckoned 1
Jim 1
had 1
fetched 1
up 1
on 1
a 1
snag 1
maybe 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
up 1
with 1
him 1
I 1
was 1
good 1
and 1
tired 1
so 1
I 1
laid 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
bother 1
no 1
more 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
sleep 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
sleepy 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
help 1
it 1
so 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
would 1
take 1
jest 1
one 1
little 1
cat 1
nap 1
But 1
I 1
reckon 1
it 1
was 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
cat 1
nap 1
for 1
when 1
I 1
waked 1
up 1
the 1
stars 1
was 1
shining 1
bright 1
the 1
fog 1
was 1
all 1
gone 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
spinning 1
down 1
a 1
big 1
bend 1
stern 1
first 1
First 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
where 1
I 1
was 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
was 1
dreaming 1
and 1
when 1
things 1
began 1
to 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
me 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
come 1
up 1
dim 1
out 1
of 1
last 1
week 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
monstrous 1
big 1
river 1
here 1
with 1
the 1
tallest 1
and 1
the 1
thickest 1
kind 1
of 1
timber 1
on 1
both 1
banks 1
just 1
a 1
solid 1
wall 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
by 1
the 1
stars 1
I 1
looked 1
away 1
down 1
stream 1
and 1
seen 1
a 1
black 1
speck 1
on 1
the 1
water 1
I 1
took 1
after 1
it 1
but 1
when 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
it 2
warn 1
t 1
nothing 1
but 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
sawlogs 1
made 1
fast 1
together 1
Then 1
I 1
see 1
another 1
speck 1
and 1
chased 1
that 1
then 1
another 1
and 1
this 1
time 1
I 1
was 1
right 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
raft 1
When 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
it 1
Jim 1
was 1
setting 1
there 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
down 1
between 1
his 1
knees 1
asleep 1
with 1
his 1
right 1
arm 1
hanging 1
over 1
the 1
steering 1
oar 1
The 1
other 1
oar 1
was 1
smashed 1
off 1
and 1
the 1
raft 1
was 1
littered 1
up 1
with 1
leaves 1
and 1
branches 1
and 1
dirt 1
So 1
she 1
d 1
had 1
a 1
rough 1
time 1
I 1
made 1
fast 1
and 1
laid 1
down 1
under 1
Jim 1
s 1
nose 1
on 1
the 1
raft 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
gap 1
and 1
stretch 1
my 1
fists 1
out 1
against 1
Jim 1
and 1
says 1
Hello 1

about 1
five 1
minutes 1

Then 1

like 1
dis 1
one 1
Oh 1
well 1
that 1
s 1
all 1
right 1
because 1
a 1
dream 1
does 1
tire 1
a 1
body 1
like 1
everything 1
sometimes 1
But 1
this 1
one 1
was 1
a 1
staving 1
dream 1
tell 1
me 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
Jim 1
So 1
Jim 1
went 1
to 1
work 1
and 1
told 1
me 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
right 1
through 1
just 1
as 1
it 1
happened 1
only 1
he 1
painted 1
it 1
up 1
considerable 1
Then 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
must 1
start 1
in 1
and 1
terpret 1
it 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
sent 1
for 1
a 1
warning 1
He 1
said 1
the 1
first 1
towhead 1
stood 1
for 1
a 1
man 1
that 1
would 1
try 1
to 1
do 1
us 1
some 1
good 1
but 1
the 1
current 1
was 1
another 1
man 1
that 1
would 1
get 1
us 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
The 1
whoops 1
was 1
warnings 1
that 1
would 1
come 1
to 1
us 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
and 1
if 1
we 1
didn 1
t 1
try 1
hard 1
to 1
make 1
out 1
to 1
understand 1
them 1
they 1
d 1
just 1
take 1
us 1
into 1
bad 1
luck 1
stead 1
of 1
keeping 1
us 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
The 1
lot 1
of 1
towheads 1
was 1
troubles 1
we 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
get 1
into 1
with 1
quarrelsome 1
people 1
and 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
mean 1
folks 1
but 1
if 1
we 1
minded 1
our 1
business 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
talk 1
back 1
and 1
aggravate 1
them 1
we 1
would 1
pull 1
through 1
and 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
fog 1
and 1
into 1
the 1
big 1
clear 1
river 1
which 1
was 1
the 1
free 1
States 1
and 1
wouldn 1
t 1
have 1
no 1
more 1
trouble 1
It 1
had 1
clouded 1
up 1
pretty 1
dark 1
just 1
after 1
I 1
got 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
raft 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
clearing 1
up 1
again 1
now 1
Oh 1
well 1
that 1
s 1
all 1
interpreted 1
well 1
enough 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
it 1
goes 1
Jim 1
I 1
says 1
but 1
what 1
does 1
these 1
things 1
stand 1
for 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
leaves 1
and 1
rubbish 1
on 1
the 1
raft 1
and 1
the 1
smashed 1
oar 1
You 1
could 1
see 1
them 1
first 1
rate 1
now 1
Jim 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
trash 1
and 1
then 1
looked 1
at 1
me 1
and 1
back 1
at 1
the 1
trash 1
again 1
He 1
had 1
got 1
the 1
dream 1
fixed 1
so 1
strong 1
in 1
his 1
head 1
that 1
he 1
couldn 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
shake 1
it 1
loose 1
and 1
get 1
the 1
facts 1
back 1
into 1
its 1
place 1
again 1
right 1
away 1
But 1
when 1
he 1
did 1
get 1
the 1
thing 1
straightened 1
around 1
he 1
looked 1
at 1
me 1
steady 1
without 1
ever 1
smiling 1
and 1
says 1
What 1
do 1
dey 1
stan 1
for 1
I 1
se 1

Then 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
slow 1
and 1
walked 1
to 1
the 1
wigwam 1
and 1
went 1
in 1
there 1
without 1
saying 1
anything 1
but 1
that 1
But 1
that 1
was 1
enough 1
It 1
made 1
me 1
feel 1
so 1
mean 1
I 1
could 1
almost 1
kissed 1
his 1
foot 1
to 1
get 1
him 1
to 1
take 1
it 1
back 1
It 1
was 1
fifteen 1
minutes 1
before 1
I 1
could 1
work 1
myself 1
up 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
humble 1
myself 1
to 1
a 1
nigger 1
but 1
I 1
done 1

and 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
ever 1
sorry 1
for 1
it 1
afterwards 1
neither 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
do 1
him 1
no 1
more 1
mean 1
tricks 1
and 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
done 1
that 1
one 1
if 1
I 1
d 1
a 1
knowed 1
it 1
would 1
make 1
him 1
feel 1
that 1
way 1
CHAPTER 1
XVI 1
WE 1
slept 1
most 1
all 1
day 1
and 1
started 1
out 1
at 1
night 1
a 1
little 1
ways 1
behind 1
a 1
monstrous 1
long 1
raft 1
that 1
was 1
as 1
long 1
going 1
by 1
as 1
a 1
procession 1
She 1
had 1
four 1
long 1
sweeps 1
at 1
each 1
end 1
so 1
we 1
judged 1
she 1
carried 1
as 1
many 1
as 1
thirty 1
men 1
likely 1
She 1
had 1
five 1
big 1
wigwams 1
aboard 1
wide 1
apart 1
and 1
an 1
open 1
camp 1
fire 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
and 1
a 1
tall 1
flag 1
pole 1
at 1
each 1
end 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
power 1
of 1
style 1
about 1
her 1
It 1
amounted 1
to 1
something 1
being 1
a 1
raftsman 1
on 1
such 1
a 1
craft 1
as 1
that 1
We 1
went 1
drifting 1
down 1
into 1
a 1
big 1
bend 1
and 1
the 1
night 1
clouded 1
up 1
and 1
got 1
hot 1
The 1
river 1
was 1
very 1
wide 1
and 1
was 1
walled 1
with 1
solid 1
timber 1
on 1
both 1
sides 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
a 1
break 1
in 1
it 1
hardly 1
ever 1
or 1
a 1
light 1
We 1
talked 1
about 1
Cairo 1
and 1
wondered 1
whether 1
we 1
would 1
know 1
it 1
when 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
it 1
I 1
said 1
likely 1
we 1
wouldn 1
t 1
because 1
I 1
had 1
heard 1
say 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
but 1
about 1
a 1
dozen 1
houses 1
there 1
and 1
if 1
they 1
didn 1
t 1
happen 1
to 1
have 1
them 1
lit 1
up 1
how 1
was 1
we 1
going 1
to 1
know 1
we 1
was 1
passing 1
a 1
town 1
Jim 1
said 1
if 1
the 1
two 1
big 1
rivers 1
joined 1
together 1
there 1
that 1
would 1
show 1
But 1
I 1
said 1
maybe 1
we 1
might 1
think 1
we 1
was 1
passing 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
an 1
island 1
and 1
coming 1
into 1
the 1
same 1
old 1
river 1
again 1
That 1
disturbed 1
Jim 1
and 1
me 1
too 1
So 1
the 1
question 1
was 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
I 1
said 1
paddle 1
ashore 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
a 1
light 1
showed 1
and 1
tell 1
them 1
pap 1
was 1
behind 1
coming 1
along 1
with 1
a 1
trading 1
scow 1
and 1
was 1
a 1
green 1
hand 1
at 1
the 1
business 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
how 1
far 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
Cairo 1
Jim 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
idea 1
so 1
we 1
took 1
a 1
smoke 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
waited 1
There 1
warn 1
t 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
now 1
but 1
to 1
look 1
out 1
sharp 1
for 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
not 1
pass 1
it 1
without 1
seeing 1
it 1
He 1
said 1
he 1
d 1
be 1
mighty 1
sure 1
to 1
see 1
it 1
because 1
he 1
d 1
be 1
a 1
free 1
man 1
the 1
minute 1
he 1
seen 1
it 1
but 1
if 1
he 1
missed 1
it 1
he 1
d 1
be 1
in 1
a 1
slave 1
country 1
again 1
and 1
no 1
more 1
show 1
for 1
freedom 1
Every 1
little 1
while 1
he 1
jumps 1
up 1
and 1
says 1
Dah 1
she 1
is 1
But 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
It 1
was 1
Jack 1
o 1
lanterns 1
or 1
lightning 1
bugs 1
so 1
he 1
set 1
down 1
again 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
watching 1
same 1
as 1
before 1
Jim 1
said 1
it 1
made 1
him 1
all 1
over 1
trembly 1
and 1
feverish 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
close 1
to 1
freedom 1
Well 1
I 1
can 1
tell 1
you 1
it 1
made 1
me 1
all 1
over 1
trembly 1
and 1
feverish 1
too 1
to 1
hear 1
him 1
because 1
I 1
begun 1
to 1
get 1
it 1
through 1
my 1
head 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
most 1
free 1
and 1
who 1
was 1
to 1
blame 1
for 1
it 1
Why 1
me 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
get 1
that 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
conscience 1
no 1
how 1
nor 1
no 1
way 1
It 1
got 1
to 1
troubling 1
me 1
so 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
rest 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
stay 1
still 1
in 1
one 1
place 1
It 1
hadn 1
t 1
ever 1
come 1
home 1
to 1
me 1
before 1
what 1
this 1
thing 1
was 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
doing 1
But 1
now 1
it 1
did 1
and 1
it 1
stayed 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
scorched 1
me 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
I 1
tried 1
to 1
make 1
out 1
to 1
myself 1
that 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
to 1
blame 1
because 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
run 1
Jim 1
off 1
from 1
his 1
rightful 1
owner 1
but 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
use 1
conscience 1
up 1
and 1
says 1
every 1
time 1
But 1
you 1
knowed 1
he 1
was 1
running 1
for 1
his 1
freedom 1
and 1
you 1
could 1
a 1
paddled 1
ashore 1
and 1
told 1
somebody 1
That 1
was 1
so 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
get 1
around 1
that 1
noway 1
That 1
was 1
where 1
it 1
pinched 1
Conscience 1
says 1
to 1
me 1
What 1
had 1
poor 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
done 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
her 1
nigger 1
go 1
off 1
right 1
under 1
your 1
eyes 1
and 1
never 1
say 1
one 1
single 1
word 1
What 1
did 1
that 1
poor 1
old 1
woman 1
do 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
treat 1
her 1
so 1
mean 1
Why 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
learn 1
you 1
your 1
book 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
learn 1
you 1
your 1
manners 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
be 1
good 1
to 1
you 1
every 1
way 1
she 1
knowed 1
how 1
That 1
s 1
what 1
she 1
done 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
feeling 1
so 1
mean 1
and 1
so 1
miserable 1
I 1
most 1
wished 1
I 1
was 1
dead 1
I 1
fidgeted 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
raft 1
abusing 1
myself 1
to 1
myself 1
and 1
Jim 1
was 1
fidgeting 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
past 1
me 1
We 1
neither 1
of 1
us 1
could 1
keep 1
still 1
Every 1
time 1
he 1
danced 1
around 1
and 1
says 1
Dah 1
s 1
Cairo 1
it 1
went 1
through 1
me 1
like 1
a 1
shot 1
and 1
I 1
thought 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
Cairo 1
I 1
reckoned 1
I 1
would 1
die 1
of 1
miserableness 1
Jim 1
talked 1
out 1
loud 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
while 1
I 1
was 1
talking 1
to 1
myself 1
He 1
was 1
saying 1
how 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
he 1
would 1
do 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
to 1
a 1
free 1
State 1
he 1
would 1
go 1
to 1
saving 1
up 1
money 1
and 1
never 1
spend 1
a 1
single 1
cent 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
enough 1
he 1
would 1
buy 1
his 1
wife 1
which 1
was 1
owned 1
on 1
a 1
farm 1
close 1
to 1
where 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
lived 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
would 1
both 1
work 1

get 1
an 1
Ab 1

It 1
most 1
froze 1
me 1
to 1
hear 1
such 1
talk 1
He 1
wouldn 1
t 1
ever 1
dared 1
to 1
talk 1
such 1
talk 1
in 1
his 1
life 1
before 1
Just 1
see 1
what 1
a 1
difference 1
it 1
made 1
in 1
him 1
the 1
minute 1
he 1
judged 1
he 1
was 1
about 1
free 1
It 1
was 1
according 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
saying 1
Give 1
a 1
nigger 1
an 1
inch 1
and 1
he 1
ll 1
take 1
an 1
ell 1
Thinks 1
I 1
this 1
is 1
what 1
comes 1
of 1
my 1
not 1
thinking 1
Here 1
was 1
this 1
nigger 1

I 1
had 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
helped 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
coming 1
right 1
out 1
flat 1
footed 1
and 1
saying 1
he 1
would 1
steal 1
his 1
children 2
that 1
belonged 1
to 1
a 1
man 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
even 1
know 1
a 1
man 1
that 1
hadn 1
t 1
ever 1
done 1
me 1
no 1
harm 1
I 1
was 1
sorry 1
to 1
hear 1
Jim 1
say 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
lowering 1
of 1
him 1
My 1
conscience 1

to 1
stirring 1

They 1

off 1
and 1
I 1
got 1
aboard 1

bundles 1
and 1
getting 1
all 1
ready 1
to 1
quit 1
rafting 1
That 1
night 1
about 1
ten 1
we 1
hove 1
in 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
lights 1
of 1
a 1
town 1
away 1
down 1
in 1
a 1
left 1
hand 1
bend 1
I 1
went 1
off 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
to 1
ask 1
about 1
it 1
Pretty 1
soon 1
I 1
found 1
a 1
man 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
river 1
with 1
a 1
skiff 1
setting 1
a 1
trot 1
line 1
I 1
ranged 1
up 1
and 1
says 1
Mister 1
is 1
that 1
town 1
Cairo 2
no 1
You 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
blame 1
fool 1
What 1
town 1
is 1
it 1
mister 1
If 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
know 1
go 1
and 1
find 1
out 1
If 1
you 1
stay 1
here 1
botherin 1
around 1
me 1
for 1
about 1
a 1
half 1
a 1
minute 1
longer 1
you 1
ll 1
get 1
something 1
you 1
won 1
t 1
want 1
I 1
paddled 1
to 1
the 1
raft 1
Jim 1
was 1
awful 1
disappointed 1
but 1
I 1
said 1
never 1
mind 1
Cairo 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
next 1
place 1
I 1
reckoned 1
We 1
passed 1
another 1
town 1
before 1
daylight 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
going 1
out 1
again 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
high 1
ground 1
so 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
go 1
No 1
high 1
ground 1
about 1
Cairo 1
Jim 1
said 1
I 1
had 1
forgot 1
it 1
We 1
laid 1
up 1
for 1
the 1
day 1
on 1
a 1
towhead 1
tolerable 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
left 1
hand 1
bank 1
I 1
begun 1
to 1
suspicion 1
something 1
So 1
did 1
Jim 1
I 1
says 1
Maybe 1
we 1
went 1
by 1
Cairo 1
in 1
the 1
fog 1
that 1
night 1
He 1
says 1
Doan 1
le 1
s 1
talk 1
about 1
it 1
Huck 1
Po 1
niggers 1
can 1
t 1
have 1
no 1
luck 1
I 1
awluz 1
spected 1
dat 1
rattlesnake 1
skin 1
warn 1
t 1
done 1
wid 1
its 1
work 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
d 1
never 1
seen 1
that 1
snake 1
skin 1
Jim 1
I 1
do 1
wish 1
I 1
d 1
never 1
laid 1
eyes 1
on 1
it 1
It 1
ain 1
t 1
yo 1
fault 1
Huck 1
you 1
didn 1
know 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
blame 1
yo 1
self 1
bout 1
it 1
When 1
it 1
was 1
daylight 1
here 1
was 1
the 1
clear 1
Ohio 1
water 1
inshore 1
sure 1
enough 1
and 1
outside 1
was 1
the 1
old 1
regular 1
Muddy 1
So 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
up 1
with 1
Cairo 1
We 1
talked 1
it 1
all 1
over 1
It 1
wouldn 1
t 1
do 1
to 1
take 1
to 1
the 1
shore 1
we 1
couldn 1
t 1
take 1
the 1
raft 1
up 1
the 1
stream 1
of 1
course 1
There 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
way 1
but 1
to 1
wait 1
for 1
dark 1
and 1
start 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
take 1
the 1
chances 1
So 1
we 1
slept 1
all 1
day 1
amongst 1
the 1
cottonwood 1
thicket 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
be 1
fresh 1
for 1
the 1
work 1
and 1
when 1
we 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
raft 1
about 1
dark 1
the 1
canoe 1
was 1
gone 1
We 1
didn 1
t 1
say 1
a 1
word 1
for 1
a 1
good 1
while 1
There 1
warn 1
t 1
anything 1
to 1
say 1
We 1
both 1
knowed 1
well 1
enough 1
it 1
was 1
some 1
more 1
work 1
of 1
the 1
rattlesnake 1
skin 1
so 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
use 1
to 1
talk 1
about 1
it 1
It 1
would 1
only 1
look 1
like 1
we 1
was 1
finding 1
fault 1
and 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
bound 1
to 1
fetch 1
more 1
bad 1
luck 1
and 1
keep 1
on 1
fetching 1
it 1
too 1
till 1
we 1
knowed 1
enough 1
to 1
keep 1
still 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
we 1
talked 1
about 1
what 1
we 1
better 1
do 1
and 1
found 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
way 1
but 1
just 1
to 1
go 1
along 1
down 1
with 1
the 1
raft 1
till 1
we 1
got 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
buy 1
a 1
canoe 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
in 1
We 1
warn 1
t 1
going 1
to 1
borrow 1
it 1
when 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
anybody 1
around 1
the 1
way 1
pap 1
would 1
do 1
for 1
that 1
might 1
set 1
people 1
after 1
us 1
So 1
we 1
shoved 1
out 1
after 1
dark 1
on 1
the 1
raft 1
Anybody 1
that 1
don 1
t 1
believe 1
yet 1
that 1
it 1
s 1
foolishness 1
to 1
handle 1
a 1
snake 1
skin 1
after 1
all 1
that 2
snake 1
skin 1
done 1
for 1
us 1
will 1
believe 1
it 1
now 1
if 1
they 1
read 1
on 1
and 1
see 1
what 1
more 1
it 1
done 1
for 1
us 1
The 1
place 1
to 1
buy 1
canoes 1
is 1
off 1
of 1
rafts 1
laying 1
up 1
at 1
shore 1
But 1
we 1
didn 1
t 1
see 1
no 1
rafts 1
laying 1
up 1
so 1
we 1
went 1
along 1
during 1
three 1
hours 1
and 1
more 1
Well 1
the 1
night 1
got 1
gray 1
and 1
ruther 1
thick 1
which 1
is 1
the 1
next 1
meanest 1
thing 1
to 1
fog 1
You 1
can 1
t 1
tell 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
you 1
can 1
t 1
see 1
no 1
distance 1
It 1
got 1
to 1
be 1
very 1
late 1
and 1
still 1
and 1
then 1
along 1
comes 1
a 1
steamboat 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
We 1
lit 1
the 1
lantern 1
and 1
judged 1
she 1
would 1
see 1
it 1
Up 1
stream 1
boats 1
didn 1
t 1
generly 1
come 1
close 1
to 1
us 1
they 1
go 1
out 1
and 1
follow 1
the 1
bars 1
and 1
hunt 1
for 1
easy 1
water 1
under 1
the 1
reefs 1
but 1
nights 1
like 1
this 1
they 1
bull 1
right 1
up 1
the 1
channel 1
against 1
the 1
whole 1
river 1
We 1
could 1
hear 1
her 1
pounding 1
along 1
but 1
we 1
didn 1
t 1
see 1
her 1
good 1
till 1
she 1
was 1
close 1
She 1
aimed 1
right 1
for 1
us 1
Often 1
they 1
do 1
that 1
and 1
try 1
to 1
see 1
how 1
close 1
they 1
can 1
come 1
without 1
touching 1
sometimes 1
the 1
wheel 1
bites 1
off 1
a 1
sweep 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
pilot 1
sticks 1
his 1
head 1
out 1
and 1
laughs 1
and 1
thinks 1
he 1
s 1
mighty 1
smart 1
Well 1
here 1
she 1
comes 1
and 1
we 1
said 1
she 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
shave 1
us 1
but 1
she 1
didn 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
sheering 1
off 1
a 1
bit 1
She 1
was 1
a 1
big 1
one 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
coming 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
too 1
looking 1
like 1
a 1
black 1
cloud 1
with 1
rows 1
of 1
glow 1
worms 1
around 1
it 1
but 1
all 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
she 1
bulged 1
out 1
big 1
and 1
scary 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
row 1
of 1
wide 1
open 1
furnace 1
doors 1
shining 1
like 1
red 1
hot 1
teeth 1
and 1
her 1
monstrous 1
bows 1
and 1
guards 1
hanging 1
right 1
over 1
us 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
yell 1
at 1
us 1
and 1
a 1
jingling 1
of 1
bells 1
to 1
stop 1
the 1
engines 1
a 1
powwow 1
of 1
cussing 1
and 1
whistling 1
of 1
steam 1
and 1
as 1
Jim 1
went 1
overboard 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
I 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
she 1
come 1
smashing 1
straight 1
through 1
the 1
raft 1
I 1
dived 1
and 1
I 1
aimed 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
bottom 1
too 1
for 1
a 1
thirty 1
foot 1
wheel 1
had 1
got 1
to 1
go 1
over 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
wanted 1
it 1
to 1
have 1
plenty 1
of 1
room 1
I 1
could 1
always 1
stay 1
under 1
water 1
a 1
minute 1
this 1
time 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
stayed 1
under 1
a 1
minute 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
Then 1
I 1
bounced 1
for 1
the 1
top 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
for 1
I 1
was 1
nearly 1
busting 1
I 1
popped 1
out 1
to 1
my 1
armpits 1
and 1
blowed 1
the 1
water 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
nose 1
and 1
puffed 1
a 1
bit 1
Of 1
course 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
booming 1
current 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
that 1
boat 1
started 1
her 1
engines 1
again 1
ten 1
seconds 1
after 1
she 1
stopped 1
them 1
for 1
they 1
never 1
cared 1
much 1
for 1
raftsmen 1
so 1
now 1
she 1
was 1
churning 1
along 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
in 1
the 1
thick 1
weather 1
though 1
I 1
could 1
hear 1
her 1
I 1
sung 1
out 1
for 1
Jim 1
about 1
a 1
dozen 1
times 1
but 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
get 1
any 1
answer 1
so 1
I 1
grabbed 1
a 1
plank 1
that 1
touched 1
me 1
while 1
I 1
was 1
treading 1
water 1
and 1
struck 1
out 1
for 1
shore 1
shoving 1
it 1
ahead 1
of 1
me 1
But 1
I 1
made 1
out 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
drift 1
of 1
the 1
current 1
was 1
towards 1
the 1
left 1
hand 1
shore 1
which 1
meant 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
crossing 1
so 1
I 1
changed 1
off 1
and 1
went 1
that 1
way 1
It 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
long 1
slanting 1
two 1
mile 1
crossings 1
so 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
long 1
time 1
in 1
getting 1
over 1
I 1
made 1
a 1
safe 1
landing 1
and 1
clumb 1
up 1
the 1
bank 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
but 1
a 1
little 1
ways 1
but 1
I 1
went 1
poking 1
along 1
over 1
rough 1
ground 1
for 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
or 1
more 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
run 1
across 1
a 1
big 1
old 1
fashioned 1
double 1
log 1
house 1
before 1
I 1
noticed 1
it 1
I 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
rush 1
by 1
and 1
get 1
away 1
but 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
dogs 1
jumped 1
out 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
howling 1
and 1
barking 1
at 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
knowed 1
better 1
than 1
to 1
move 1
another 1
peg 1
CHAPTER 1
XVII 1
IN 1
about 1
a 1
minute 1
somebody 1
spoke 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
window 1
without 1
putting 1

head 1
out 1

Come 1

I 1
couldn 1
t 1
if 1
I 1
d 1
a 1
wanted 1
to 1
I 1
took 1
one 1
slow 1
step 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
and 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
a 1
sound 1
only 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
could 1
hear 1
my 1
heart 1
The 1
dogs 1
were 1
as 1
still 1
as 1
the 1
humans 1
but 1
they 1
followed 1
a 1
little 1
behind 1
me 1
When 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
three 1
log 1
doorsteps 1
I 1
heard 1
them 1
unlocking 1
and 1
unbarring 1
and 1
unbolting 1
I 1
put 1
my 1
hand 1
on 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
pushed 1
it 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
till 1
somebody 1
said 1
There 1
that 1
s 1
enough 1
put 1
your 1
head 1
in 1
I 1
done 1
it 1
but 1
I 1
judged 1
they 1
would 1
take 1
it 1
off 1
The 1
candle 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
there 1
they 1
all 1
was 1
looking 1
at 1
me 1
and 1
me 1
at 1
them 1
for 1
about 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
minute 1
Three 1
big 1
men 1
with 1
guns 1
pointed 1
at 1
me 1
which 1
made 1
me 1
wince 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
the 1
oldest 1
gray 1
and 1
about 1
sixty 1
the 1
other 1
two 1
thirty 1
or 1
more 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
fine 1
and 1
handsome 1
and 1
the 1
sweetest 1
old 1
gray 1
headed 1
lady 1
and 1
back 1
of 1
her 1
two 1
young 1
women 1
which 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
right 1
well 1
The 1
old 1
gentleman 1
says 1
There 1
I 1
reckon 1
it 1
s 1
all 1
right 1
Come 1
in 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
gentleman 1
he 1
locked 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
barred 1
it 1
and 1
bolted 1
it 1
and 1
told 1
the 1
young 1
men 1
to 1
come 1
in 1
with 1
their 1
guns 1
and 1
they 1
all 1
went 1
in 1
a 1
big 1
parlor 1
that 1
had 1
a 1
new 1
rag 1
carpet 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
got 1
together 1
in 1
a 1
corner 1
that 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
range 1
of 1
the 1
front 1
windows 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
none 1
on 1
the 1
side 1
They 1
held 1
the 1
candle 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
good 1
look 1
at 1
me 1
and 1
all 1
said 1
Why 1
he 1
ain 1
t 1
a 1
Shepherdson 1
no 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
any 1
Shepherdson 1
about 1
him 1
Then 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
said 1
he 1
hoped 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
mind 1
being 1
searched 1
for 1
arms 1
because 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
mean 1
no 1
harm 1
by 1
it 2
was 1
only 1
to 1
make 1
sure 1
So 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
pry 1
into 1
my 1
pockets 1
but 1
only 1
felt 1
outside 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
He 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
make 1
myself 1
easy 1
and 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
tell 1
all 1
about 1
myself 1
but 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
says 1
Why 1
bless 1
you 1
Saul 1
the 1
poor 1
thing 1

be 1

s 1
hungry 1
True 1
for 1

Rachel 1
I 1

So 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
says 1
Betsy 1

a 1
nigger 1
woman 1

or 1

or 1
along 1
there 1
though 1
he 1

bigger 1
than 1
me 1
He 1
hadn 1
t 1

anything 1
but 1
a 1
shirt 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
frowzy 1
headed 1
He 1
came 1
in 1
gaping 1
and 1
digging 1
one 1
fist 1
into 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
dragging 1
a 1
gun 1
along 1
with 1
the 1
other 1
one 1
He 1
says 1
Ain 1

pipes 1
except 1
the 1
nigger 1

two 1
young 1
women 1
They 1

The 1
young 1
women 1
had 1
quilts 1
around 1
them 1
and 1
their 1
hair 1
down 1
their 1
backs 1
They 1
all 1
asked 1
me 1
questions 1
and 1
I 1
told 1
them 1
how 1
pap 1
and 1
me 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
family 1
was 1
living 1
on 1
a 1
little 1
farm 1
down 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
Arkansaw 1
and 1
my 1
sister 1
Mary 1
Ann 1
run 1
off 1
and 1
got 1
married 1
and 1
never 1
was 1
heard 1

and 1
Bill 1
went 1
to 1
hunt 1
them 1
and 1
he 1
warn 1
t 1
heard 1
of 1
no 1
more 1
and 1
Tom 1
and 1
Mort 1
died 1
and 1
then 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
nobody 1
but 1
just 1
me 1
and 1
pap 1
left 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
just 1
trimmed 1
down 1
to 1
nothing 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
his 1
troubles 1
so 1
when 1
he 1
died 1
I 1
took 1
what 1
there 1
was 1
left 1
because 1
the 1
farm 1
didn 1
t 1
belong 1
to 1
us 1
and 1
started 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
deck 1
passage 1
and 1
fell 1
overboard 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
how 1
I 1
come 1
to 1
be 1
here 1
So 1
they 1
said 1
I 1
could 1
have 1
a 1
home 1
there 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
I 1
wanted 1
it 1
Then 1
it 1
was 1
most 1
daylight 1
and 1
everybody 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
and 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
with 1
Buck 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
waked 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
drat 1
it 1
all 1
I 1
had 1
forgot 1
what 1
my 1
name 1
was 1
So 1
I 1
laid 1
there 1
about 1
an 1
hour 1
trying 1
to 1
think 1
and 1
when 1
Buck 1
waked 1
up 1
I 1
says 1
Can 1
you 1
spell 1
Buck 1
Yes 1
he 1
says 1
I 1
bet 1

can 1
t 1
spell 1
my 1
name 1
says 1
I 2
bet 1
you 1
what 1
you 1
dare 1
I 1
can 1
says 1
he 1
All 1
right 1
says 1
I 1
go 1
ahead 1
G 1
e 1
o 1
r 1
g 1
e 1
J 1
a 1
x 1
o 1
n 1
there 1
now 1
he 1
says 1
Well 1
says 1
I 1
you 1
done 1
it 1
but 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
think 1
you 1
could 1
It 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
slouch 1
of 1
a 1
name 1
to 1
spell 1
right 1
off 1
without 1
studying 1
I 1
set 1
it 1
down 1
private 1
because 1
somebody 1
might 1
want 1
me 1
to 1
spell 1
it 1
next 1
and 1
so 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
be 1
handy 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
rattle 1
it 1
off 1
like 1
I 1
was 1
used 1
to 1
it 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
mighty 1
nice 1
family 1
and 1
a 1
mighty 1
nice 1
house 1
too 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
seen 1
no 1
house 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
before 1
that 1
was 1
so 1
nice 1
and 1
had 1
so 1
much 1
style 1
It 1
didn 1
t 1
have 1
an 1
iron 1
latch 1
on 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
nor 1
a 1
wooden 1
one 1
with 1
a 1
buckskin 1
string 1
but 1
a 1
brass 1
knob 1
to 1
turn 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
houses 1
in 1
town 1
There 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
bed 1
in 1
the 1
parlor 1
nor 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
a 1
bed 1
but 1
heaps 1
of 1
parlors 1
in 1
towns 1
has 1
beds 1
in 1
them 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
big 1
fireplace 1
that 1
was 1
bricked 1
on 1
the 1
bottom 1
and 1
the 1
bricks 1
was 1
kept 1
clean 1
and 1
red 1
by 1
pouring 1
water 1
on 1
them 1
and 1
scrubbing 1
them 1
with 1
another 1
brick 1
sometimes 1
they 1
wash 1
them 1
over 1
with 1
red 1
water 1
paint 1
that 1
they 1
call 1
Spanish 1
brown 1
same 1
as 1
they 1
do 1
in 1
town 1
They 1
had 1
big 1
brass 1
dog 1
irons 1
that 1
could 1
hold 1
up 1
a 1
saw 1
log 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
clock 1
on 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
mantelpiece 1
with 1
a 1
picture 1
of 1
a 1
town 1
painted 1
on 1
the 1
bottom 1
half 1
of 1
the 1
glass 1
front 1
and 1
a 1
round 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
it 1
for 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
pendulum 1
swinging 1
behind 1
it 1
It 1
was 1
beautiful 1
to 1
hear 1
that 1
clock 1
tick 1
and 1
sometimes 1
when 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
peddlers 1
had 1
been 1
along 1
and 1
scoured 1
her 1
up 1
and 1
got 1
her 1
in 1
good 1
shape 1
she 1
would 1
start 1
in 1
and 1
strike 1
a 1
hundred 1
and 1
fifty 1
before 1
she 1
got 1
tuckered 1
out 1
They 1
wouldn 1
t 1
took 1
any 1
money 1
for 1
her 1
Well 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
big 1
outlandish 1
parrot 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
clock 1
made 1
out 1
of 1
something 1
like 1
chalk 1
and 1
painted 1
up 1
gaudy 1
By 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
parrots 1
was 1
a 1
cat 1
made 1
of 1
crockery 1
and 1
a 1
crockery 1
dog 1
by 1
the 1
other 1
and 1
when 1
you 1
pressed 1
down 1
on 1
them 1
they 1
squeaked 1
but 1
didn 1
t 1
open 1
their 1
mouths 1
nor 1
look 1
different 1
nor 1
interested 1
They 1
squeaked 1
through 1
underneath 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
big 1
wild 1
turkey 1
wing 1
fans 1
spread 1
out 1
behind 1
those 1
things 1
On 1
the 1
table 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
was 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
lovely 1
crockery 1
basket 1
that 1
had 1
apples 1
and 1
oranges 1
and 1
peaches 1
and 1
grapes 1
piled 1
up 1
in 1
it 1
which 1
was 1
much 1
redder 1
and 1
yellower 1
and 1
prettier 1
than 1
real 1
ones 1
is 1
but 1
they 1
warn 1
t 1
real 1
because 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
where 1
pieces 1
had 1
got 1
chipped 1
off 1
and 1
showed 1
the 1
white 1
chalk 1
or 1
whatever 1
it 1
was 1
underneath 1
This 1
table 1
had 1
a 1
cover 1
made 1
out 1
of 1
beautiful 1
oilcloth 1
with 1
a 1
red 1
and 1
blue 1
spread 1
eagle 1
painted 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
a 1
painted 1
border 1
all 1
around 1
It 1
come 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
from 1
Philadelphia 1
they 1
said 1
There 1
was 1
some 1
books 1
too 1
piled 1
up 1
perfectly 1
exact 1
on 1
each 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
table 1
One 1
was 1
a 1
big 1
family 1
Bible 1
full 1
of 1
pictures 1
One 1
was 1
Pilgrim 1
s 1
Progress 1
about 1
a 1
man 1
that 1
left 1
his 1
family 1
it 1
didn 1
t 1
say 1
why 1
I 1
read 1
considerable 1
in 1
it 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
The 1
statements 1
was 1
interesting 1
but 1
tough 1
Another 1
was 1
Friendship 1
s 1
Offering 1
full 1
of 1
beautiful 1
stuff 1
and 1
poetry 1
but 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
read 1
the 1
poetry 1
Another 1
was 1
Henry 1
Clay 1
s 1
Speeches 1
and 1
another 1
was 1
Dr 1
Gunn 1
s 1
Family 1
Medicine 1
which 1
told 1
you 1
all 1
about 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
if 1
a 1
body 1
was 1
sick 1
or 1
dead 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
hymn 1
book 1
and 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
other 1
books 1
And 1
there 1
was 1
nice 1
split 1
bottom 1
chairs 1
and 1
perfectly 1
sound 1
too 1
not 1
bagged 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
and 1
busted 1
like 1
an 1
old 1
basket 1
They 1
had 1
pictures 1
hung 1
on 1
the 1
walls 1
mainly 1
Washingtons 1
and 1
Lafayettes 1
and 1
battles 1
and 1
Highland 1
Marys 1
and 1
one 1
called 1
Signing 1
the 1
Declaration 1
There 1
was 1
some 1
that 1
they 1
called 1
crayons 1
which 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
daughters 1
which 1
was 1
dead 1
made 1
her 1
own 1
self 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
only 1
fifteen 1
years 1
old 1
They 1
was 1
different 1
from 1
any 1
pictures 1
I 1
ever 1
see 1
before 1
blacker 1
mostly 1
than 1
is 1
common 1
One 1
was 1
a 1
woman 1
in 1
a 1
slim 1
black 1
dress 1
belted 1
small 1
under 1
the 1
armpits 1
with 1
bulges 1
like 1
a 1
cabbage 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
sleeves 1
and 1
a 1
large 1
black 1
scoop 1
shovel 1
bonnet 1
with 1
a 1
black 1
veil 1
and 1
white 1
slim 1
ankles 1
crossed 1
about 1
with 1
black 1
tape 1
and 1
very 1
wee 1
black 1
slippers 1
like 1
a 1
chisel 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
leaning 1
pensive 1
on 1
a 1
tombstone 1
on 1
her 1
right 1
elbow 1
under 1
a 1
weeping 1
willow 1
and 1
her 1
other 1
hand 1
hanging 1
down 1
her 1
side 1
holding 1
a 1
white 1
handkerchief 1
and 1
a 1
reticule 1
and 1
underneath 1
the 1
picture 1
it 1
said 1
Shall 1
I 1
Never 1
See 1
Thee 1
More 1
Alas 1
Another 1
one 1
was 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
with 1
her 1
hair 1
all 1
combed 1
up 1
straight 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
knotted 1
there 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
a 1
comb 1
like 1
a 1
chair 1
back 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
crying 1
into 1
a 1
handkerchief 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
dead 1
bird 1
laying 1
on 1
its 1
back 1
in 1
her 1
other 1
hand 1
with 1
its 1
heels 1
up 1
and 1
underneath 1
the 1
picture 1
it 1
said 1
I 1
Shall 1
Never 1
Hear 1
Thy 1
Sweet 1
Chirrup 1
More 1
Alas 1
There 1
was 1
one 1
where 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
was 1
at 1
a 1
window 1
looking 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
moon 1
and 1
tears 1
running 1
down 1
her 1
cheeks 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
an 1
open 1
letter 1
in 1
one 1
hand 1
with 1
black 1
sealing 1
wax 1
showing 1
on 1
one 1
edge 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
mashing 1
a 1
locket 1
with 1
a 1
chain 1
to 1
it 1
against 1
her 1
mouth 1
and 1
underneath 1
the 1
picture 1
it 1
said 1
And 1
Art 1
Thou 1
Gone 1
Yes 1
Thou 1
Art 1
Gone 1
Alas 1
These 1
was 1
all 1
nice 1
pictures 1
I 1
reckon 1
but 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
somehow 1
seem 1
to 1
take 1
to 1
them 1
because 1
if 1
ever 1
I 1
was 1
down 1
a 1
little 1
they 1
always 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
fan 1
tods 1
Everybody 1
was 1
sorry 1
she 1
died 1
because 1
she 1
had 1
laid 1
out 1
a 1
lot 1
more 1
of 1
these 1
pictures 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
a 1
body 1
could 1
see 1
by 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
what 1
they 1
had 1
lost 1
But 1
I 1
reckoned 1
that 1
with 1
her 1
disposition 1
she 1
was 1
having 1
a 1
better 1
time 1
in 1
the 1
graveyard 1
She 1
was 1
at 1
work 1
on 1
what 1
they 1
said 1
was 1
her 1
greatest 1
picture 1
when 1
she 1
took 1
sick 1
and 1
every 1
day 1
and 1
every 1
night 1
it 1
was 1
her 1
prayer 1
to 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
live 1
till 1
she 1
got 1
it 1
done 1
but 1
she 1
never 1
got 1
the 1
chance 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
picture 1
of 1
a 1
young 1
woman 1
in 1
a 1
long 1
white 1
gown 1
standing 1
on 1
the 1
rail 1
of 1
a 1
bridge 1
all 1
ready 1
to 1
jump 1
off 1
with 1
her 1
hair 1
all 1
down 1
her 1
back 1
and 1
looking 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
moon 1
with 1
the 1
tears 1
running 1
down 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
two 1
arms 1
folded 1
across 1
her 1
breast 1
and 1
two 1
arms 1
stretched 1
out 1
in 1
front 1
and 1
two 1
more 1
reaching 1
up 1
towards 1
the 1
moon 1
and 1
the 1
idea 1
was 1
to 1
see 1
which 1
pair 1
would 1
look 1
best 1
and 1
then 1
scratch 1
out 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
arms 1
but 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
saying 1
she 1
died 1
before 1
she 1
got 1
her 1
mind 1
made 1
up 1
and 1
now 1
they 1
kept 1
this 1
picture 1
over 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
in 1
her 1
room 1
and 1
every 1
time 1
her 1
birthday 1
come 1
they 1
hung 1
flowers 1
on 1
it 1
Other 1
times 1
it 1
was 1
hid 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
curtain 1
The 1
young 1
woman 1
in 1
the 1
picture 1
had 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
nice 1
sweet 1
face 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
so 1
many 1
arms 1
it 1
made 1
her 1
look 1
too 1
spidery 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
This 1
young 1
girl 1
kept 1
a 1
scrap 1
book 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
alive 1
and 1
used 1
to 1
paste 1
obituaries 1
and 1
accidents 1
and 1
cases 1
of 1
patient 1
suffering 1
in 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
Presbyterian 1
Observer 1
and 1
write 1
poetry 1
after 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
head 1
It 1
was 1
very 1
good 1
poetry 1
This 1
is 1
what 1
she 1
wrote 1
about 1
a 1
boy 1
by 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
Stephen 1
Dowling 1
Bots 1
that 1
fell 1
down 1
a 1
well 1
and 1
was 1
drownded 1
ODE 1
TO 1
STEPHEN 1
DOWLING 1
BOTS 1
DEC 1
D 1
And 1
did 1
young 1
Stephen 1
sicken 1
And 1
did 1
young 1
Stephen 1
die 1
And 1
did 1
the 1
sad 1
hearts 1
thicken 1
And 1
did 1
the 1
mourners 1
cry 1
No 1
such 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
fate 1
of 1
Young 1
Stephen 1
Dowling 1
Bots 1
Though 1
sad 1
hearts 1
round 1
him 1
thickened 1
Twas 1
not 1
from 1
sickness 1
shots 1
No 1
whooping 1
cough 1
did 1
rack 1
his 1
frame 1
Nor 1
measles 1
drear 1
with 1
spots 1
Not 1
these 1
impaired 1
the 1
sacred 1
name 1
Of 1
Stephen 1
Dowling 1
Bots 1
Despised 1
love 1
struck 1
not 1
with 1
woe 1
That 1
head 1
of 1
curly 1
knots 1
Nor 1
stomach 1
troubles 1
laid 1
him 1
low 1
Young 1
Stephen 1
Dowling 1
Bots 1
O 1
no 1
Then 1
list 1
with 1
tearful 1
eye 1
Whilst 1
I 1
his 1
fate 1
do 1
tell 1
His 1
soul 1
did 1
from 1
this 1
cold 1
world 1
fly 1
By 1
falling 1
down 1
a 1
well 1
They 1
got 1
him 1
out 1
and 1
emptied 1
him 1
Alas 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
late 1
His 1
spirit 1
was 1
gone 1
for 1
to 1
sport 1
aloft 1
In 1
the 1
realms 1
of 1
the 1
good 1
and 1
great 1
If 1
Emmeline 1
Grangerford 1
could 1
make 1
poetry 1
like 1
that 1
before 1
she 1
was 1
fourteen 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
telling 1
what 1
she 1
could 1
a 1
done 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
Buck 1
said 1
she 1
could 1
rattle 1
off 1
poetry 1
like 1
nothing 1
She 1
didn 1
t 1
ever 1
have 1
to 1
stop 1
to 1
think 1
He 1
said 1
she 1
would 1
slap 1
down 1
a 1
line 1
and 1
if 1
she 1
couldn 1
t 1
find 1
anything 1
to 1
rhyme 1
with 1
it 1
would 1
just 1
scratch 1
it 1
out 1
and 1
slap 1
down 1
another 1
one 1
and 1
go 1
ahead 1
She 1
warn 1
t 1
particular 1
she 1
could 1
write 1
about 1
anything 1
you 1
choose 1
to 1
give 1
her 1
to 1
write 1
about 1
just 1
so 1
it 1
was 1
sadful 1
Every 1
time 1
a 1
man 1
died 1
or 1
a 1
woman 1
died 1
or 1
a 1
child 1
died 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
on 1
hand 1
with 1
her 1
tribute 1
before 1
he 1
was 1
cold 1
She 1
called 1
them 1
tributes 1
The 1
neighbors 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
doctor 1
first 1
then 1
Emmeline 1
then 1
the 1
undertaker 1
the 1
undertaker 1
never 1
got 1
in 1
ahead 1
of 1
Emmeline 1
but 1
once 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
hung 1
fire 1
on 1
a 1
rhyme 1
for 1
the 1
dead 1
person 1
s 1
name 1
which 1
was 1
Whistler 1
She 1
warn 1
t 1
ever 1
the 1
same 1
after 1
that 1
she 1
never 1
complained 1
but 1
she 1
kinder 1
pined 1
away 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
live 1
long 1
Poor 1
thing 1
many 1
s 1
the 1
time 1
I 1
made 1
myself 1
go 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
room 1
that 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
hers 1
and 1
get 1
out 1
her 1
poor 1
old 1
scrap 1
book 1
and 1
read 1
in 1
it 1
when 1
her 1
pictures 1
had 1
been 1
aggravating 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
soured 1
on 1
her 1
a 1
little 1
I 1
liked 1
all 1
that 1
family 1
dead 1
ones 1
and 1
all 1
and 1
warn 1
t 1
going 1
to 1
let 1
anything 1
come 1
between 1
us 1
Poor 1
Emmeline 1
made 1
poetry 1
about 1
all 1
the 1
dead 1
people 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
alive 1
and 1
it 1
didn 1
t 1
seem 1
right 1
that 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
nobody 1
to 1
make 1
some 1
about 1
her 1
now 1
she 1
was 1
gone 1
so 1
I 1
tried 1
to 1
sweat 1
out 1
a 1
verse 1
or 1
two 1
myself 1
but 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
go 1
somehow 1
They 1
kept 1
Emmeline 1
s 1
room 1
trim 1
and 1
nice 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
things 1
fixed 1
in 1
it 1
just 1
the 1
way 1
she 1
liked 1
to 1
have 1
them 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
alive 1
and 1
nobody 1
ever 1
slept 1
there 1
The 1
old 1
lady 1
took 1
care 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
herself 1
though 1
there 1
was 1
plenty 1
of 1
niggers 1
and 1
she 1
sewed 1
there 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
and 1
read 1
her 1
Bible 1
there 1
mostly 1
Well 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
saying 1
about 1
the 1
parlor 1
there 1
was 1
beautiful 1
curtains 1
on 1
the 1
windows 1
white 1
with 1
pictures 1
painted 1
on 1
them 1
of 1
castles 1
with 1
vines 1
all 1
down 1
the 1
walls 1
and 1
cattle 1
coming 1
down 1
to 1
drink 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
old 1
piano 1
too 1
that 1
had 1
tin 1
pans 1
in 1
it 1
I 1
reckon 1
and 1
nothing 1
was 1
ever 1
so 1
lovely 1
as 1
to 1
hear 1
the 1
young 1
ladies 1
sing 1
The 1
Last 1
Link 1

Broken 1
and 1
play 1
The 1
Battle 1
of 1
Prague 1
on 1
it 1
The 1
walls 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
rooms 1
was 1
plastered 1
and 1
most 1
had 1
carpets 1
on 1
the 1
floors 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
house 1
was 1
whitewashed 1
on 1
the 1
outside 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
double 1
house 1
and 1
the 1
big 1
open 1
place 1
betwixt 1
them 1
was 1
roofed 1
and 1
floored 1
and 1
sometimes 1
the 1
table 1
was 1
set 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
cool 1
comfortable 1
place 1
Nothing 1
couldn 1
t 1
be 1
better 1
And 1
warn 1
t 1
the 1
cooking 1
good 1
and 1
just 1
bushels 1
of 1
it 1
too 1
CHAPTER 1
XVIII 1
COL 1
Grangerford 1
was 1
a 1
gentleman 1
you 1
see 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
gentleman 1
all 1
over 1
and 1
so 1
was 1
his 1
family 1
He 1
was 1
well 1
born 1
as 1
the 1
saying 1
is 1
and 1
that 1
s 1
worth 1
as 1
much 1
in 1
a 1
man 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
a 1
horse 1
so 1
the 1
Widow 1
Douglas 1
said 1
and 1
nobody 1
ever 1
denied 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
aristocracy 1
in 1
our 1
town 1
and 1
pap 1
he 1
always 1
said 1
it 1
too 1
though 1
he 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
more 1
quality 1
than 1
a 1
mudcat 1
himself 1
Col 1
Grangerford 1
was 1
very 1
tall 1
and 1
very 1
slim 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
darkish 1
paly 1
complexion 1
not 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
red 1
in 1
it 1
anywheres 1
he 1
was 1
clean 1
shaved 1
every 1
morning 1
all 1
over 1
his 1
thin 1
face 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
thinnest 1
kind 1
of 1
lips 1
and 1
the 1
thinnest 1
kind 1
of 1
nostrils 1
and 1
a 1
high 1
nose 1
and 1
heavy 1
eyebrows 1
and 1
the 1
blackest 1
kind 1
of 1
eyes 1
sunk 1
so 1
deep 1
back 1
that 1
they 1
seemed 1
like 1
they 1
was 1
looking 1
out 1
of 1
caverns 1
at 1
you 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
say 1
His 1
forehead 1
was 1
high 1
and 1
his 1
hair 1
was 1
black 1
and 1
straight 1
and 1
hung 1
to 1
his 1
shoulders 1
His 1
hands 1
was 1
long 1
and 1
thin 1
and 1
every 1
day 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
he 1
put 1
on 1
a 1
clean 1
shirt 1
and 1
a 1
full 1
suit 1
from 1
head 1
to 1
foot 1
made 1
out 1
of 1
linen 1
so 1
white 1
it 1
hurt 1
your 1
eyes 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
on 1
Sundays 1
he 1
wore 1
a 1
blue 1
tail 1
coat 1
with 1
brass 1
buttons 1
on 1
it 1
He 1
carried 1
a 1
mahogany 1
cane 1
with 1
a 1
silver 1
head 1
to 1
it 1
There 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
frivolishness 1
about 1
him 1
not 1
a 1
bit 1
and 1
he 1
warn 1
t 1
ever 1
loud 1
He 1
was 1
as 1
kind 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
be 1
you 1
could 1
feel 1
that 1
you 1
know 1
and 1
so 1
you 1
had 1
confidence 1
Sometimes 1
he 1
smiled 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
good 1
to 1
see 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
straightened 1
himself 1
up 1
like 1
a 1
liberty 1
pole 1
and 1
the 1
lightning 1
begun 1
to 1
flicker 1
out 1
from 1
under 1
his 1
eyebrows 1
you 1
wanted 1
to 1
climb 1
a 1
tree 1
first 1
and 1
find 1
out 1
what 1
the 1
matter 1
was 1
afterwards 1
He 1
didn 1
t 1
ever 1
have 1
to 1
tell 1
anybody 1
to 1
mind 1
their 1
manners 1
everybody 1
was 1
always 1
good 1
mannered 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
Everybody 1
loved 1
to 1
have 1
him 1
around 1
too 1
he 1
was 1
sunshine 1
most 1
always 1
I 1
mean 1
he 1
made 1
it 1
seem 1
like 1
good 1
weather 1
When 1
he 1
turned 1
into 1
a 1
cloudbank 1
it 1
was 1
awful 1
dark 1
for 1
half 1
a 1
minute 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
enough 1
there 1
wouldn 1
t 1
nothing 1
go 1
wrong 1
again 1
for 1
a 1
week 1
When 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
come 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
all 1
the 1
family 1
got 1
up 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
chairs 1
and 1
give 1
them 1
good 1
day 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
set 1
down 1
again 1
till 1
they 1
had 1
set 1
down 1
Then 1
Tom 1
and 1
Bob 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
sideboard 1
where 1
the 1
decanter 1
was 1
and 1
mixed 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
bitters 1
and 1
handed 1
it 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
held 1
it 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
waited 1
till 1
Tom 1
s 1
and 1
Bob 1
s 1
was 1
mixed 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
bowed 1
and 1
said 1
Our 1
duty 1
to 1
you 1
sir 1
and 1
madam 1
and 1
they 1
bowed 1
the 1
least 1
bit 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
said 1
thank 1
you 1
and 1
so 1
they 1
drank 1
all 1
three 1
and 1
Bob 1
and 1
Tom 1
poured 1
a 1
spoonful 1
of 1
water 1
on 1
the 1
sugar 1
and 1
the 1
mite 1
of 1
whisky 1
or 1
apple 1
brandy 1
in 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
their 1
tumblers 1
and 1
give 1
it 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
Buck 1
and 1
we 1
drank 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
people 1
too 1
Bob 1
was 1
the 1
oldest 1
and 1
Tom 1
next 1
tall 1
beautiful 1
men 1
with 1
very 1
broad 1
shoulders 1
and 1
brown 1
faces 1
and 1
long 1
black 1
hair 1
and 1
black 1
eyes 1
They 1
dressed 1
in 1
white 1
linen 1
from 1
head 1
to 1
foot 1
like 1
the 1
old 1
gentleman 1
and 1
wore 1
broad 1
Panama 1
hats 1
Then 1
there 1
was 1
Miss 1
Charlotte 1
she 1
was 1
twenty 1
five 1
and 1
tall 1
and 1
proud 1
and 1
grand 1
but 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
she 1
could 1
be 1
when 1
she 1
warn 1
t 1
stirred 1
up 1
but 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
look 1
that 1
would 1
make 1
you 1
wilt 1
in 1
your 1
tracks 1
like 1
her 1
father 1
She 1
was 1
beautiful 1
So 1
was 1
her 1
sister 1
Miss 1
Sophia 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
different 1
kind 1
She 1
was 1
gentle 1
and 1
sweet 1
like 1
a 1
dove 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
only 1
twenty 1
Each 1
person 1
had 1
their 1
own 1
nigger 1
to 1
wait 1
on 1
them 1
Buck 1
too 1
My 1
nigger 1
had 1
a 1
monstrous 1
easy 1
time 1
because 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
used 1
to 1
having 1
anybody 1
do 1
anything 1
for 1
me 1
but 1
Buck 1
s 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
jump 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
This 1
was 1
all 1
there 1
was 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
now 1
but 1
there 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
more 1
three 1
sons 1
they 1
got 1
killed 1
and 1
Emmeline 1
that 1
died 1
The 1
old 1
gentleman 1
owned 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
farms 1
and 1
over 1
a 1
hundred 1
niggers 1
Sometimes 1
a 1
stack 1
of 1
people 1
would 1
come 1
there 1
horseback 1
from 1
ten 1
or 1
fifteen 1
mile 1
around 1
and 1
stay 1
five 1
or 1
six 1
days 1
and 1
have 1
such 1
junketings 1
round 1
about 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
dances 1
and 1
picnics 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
daytimes 1
and 1
balls 1
at 1
the 1
house 1
nights 1
These 1
people 1
was 1
mostly 1
kinfolks 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
The 1
men 1
brought 1
their 1
guns 1
with 1
them 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
handsome 1
lot 1
of 1
quality 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
There 1
was 1
another 1
clan 1
of 1
aristocracy 1
around 1
there 1
five 1
or 1
six 1
families 1
mostly 1
of 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
Shepherdson 1
They 1
was 1
as 1
high 1
toned 1
and 1
well 1
born 1
and 1
rich 1
and 1
grand 1
as 1
the 1
tribe 1
of 1
Grangerfords 1
The 1
Shepherdsons 1
and 1
Grangerfords 1
used 1
the 1
same 1
steamboat 1
landing 1
which 1
was 1
about 1
two 1
mile 1
above 1
our 1
house 1
so 1
sometimes 1
when 1
I 1
went 1
up 1
there 1
with 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
our 1
folks 1
I 1
used 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
the 1
Shepherdsons 1
there 1
on 1
their 1
fine 1
horses 1
One 1
day 1
Buck 1
and 1
me 1
was 1
away 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
hunting 1
and 1
heard 1
a 1
horse 1
coming 1
We 1
was 1
crossing 1
the 1
road 1
Buck 1
says 1
Quick 1
Jump 1
for 1
the 1
woods 1
We 1
done 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
peeped 1
down 1
the 1
woods 1
through 1
the 1
leaves 1
Pretty 1
soon 1
a 1
splendid 1
young 1
man 1
come 1
galloping 1
down 1
the 1
road 1
setting 1
his 1
horse 1
easy 1
and 1
looking 1
like 1
a 1
soldier 1
He 1
had 1
his 1
gun 1
across 1
his 1
pommel 1
I 1
had 1
seen 1
him 1
before 1
It 1
was 1
young 1
Harney 1
Shepherdson 1
I 1
heard 1
Buck 1
s 1
gun 1
go 1
off 1
at 1
my 1
ear 1
and 1
Harney 1
s 1
hat 1
tumbled 1
off 1
from 1
his 1
head 1
He 1
grabbed 1
his 1
gun 1
and 1
rode 1
straight 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
we 1
was 1
hid 1
But 1
we 1
didn 1
t 1
wait 1
We 1
started 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
on 1
a 1
run 1
The 1
woods 1
warn 1
t 1
thick 1
so 1
I 1
looked 1
over 1
my 1
shoulder 1
to 1
dodge 1
the 1
bullet 1
and 1
twice 1
I 1
seen 1
Harney 1
cover 1
Buck 1
with 1
his 1
gun 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
rode 1
away 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
come 1
to 1
get 1
his 1
hat 1
I 1
reckon 1
but 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
We 1
never 1
stopped 1
running 1
till 1
we 1
got 1
home 1
The 1
old 1
gentleman 1
s 1
eyes 1
blazed 1
a 1
minute 1
twas 1
pleasure 1
mainly 1
I 1
judged 1
then 1
his 1
face 1
sort 1
of 1
smoothed 1
down 1
and 1
he 1
says 1
kind 1
of 1
gentle 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
that 1
shooting 1
from 1
behind 1
a 1
bush 1
Why 1
didn 1
t 1

step 1
into 1
the 1
road 1
my 1
boy 1
The 1
Shepherdsons 1
don 1

father 1
They 1
always 1
take 1
advantage 1
Miss 1
Charlotte 1
she 1
held 1
her 1
head 1
up 1
like 1
a 1
queen 1
while 1
Buck 1
was 1
telling 1
his 1
tale 1
and 1
her 1
nostrils 1
spread 1
and 1
her 1
eyes 1
snapped 1
The 1
two 1
young 1
men 1
looked 1
dark 1
but 1
never 1
said 1
nothing 1
Miss 1
Sophia 1
she 1
turned 1
pale 1
but 1
the 1
color 1
come 1
back 1
when 1
she 1
found 1
the 1
man 1
warn 1
t 1
hurt 1
Soon 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
get 1
Buck 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
corn 1
cribs 1
under 1
the 1
trees 1
by 1
ourselves 1
I 1
says 1

Buck 1
Well 1

Well 1

Why 1

Well 1
says 1
Buck 1
a 1
feud 1
is 1
this 1
way 1
A 1
man 1
has 1
a 1
quarrel 1
with 1
another 1
man 1
and 1
kills 1
him 1
then 1
that 1
other 1
man 1

brother 1
kills 1
him 1
then 1
the 1
other 1
brothers 1
on 1
both 1
sides 1

another 1
then 1
the 1
cousins 1

and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
everybody 1
s 1
killed 1

there 1
ain 1
t 1

But 1
it 1
s 1
kind 1
of 1
slow 1
and 1
takes 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
Has 1
this 1

Anybody 1

Bout 1
three 1
months 1

my 1
cousin 1
Bud 1
fourteen 1
year 1
old 1
was 1
riding 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
on 1
t 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
have 1
no 1
weapon 1
with 1
him 1
which 1
was 1
blame 1
foolishness 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
lonesome 1
place 1
he 1
hears 1
a 1
horse 1
a 1
coming 1
behind 1
him 1
and 1
sees 1
old 1
Baldy 1
Shepherdson 1
a 1
linkin 1
after 1
him 1
with 1
his 1
gun 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
his 1
white 1
hair 1
a 1
flying 1
in 1
the 1
wind 1
and 1
stead 1
of 1
jumping 1
off 1
and 1
taking 1
to 1
the 1
brush 1
Bud 1
lowed 1
he 1
could 1
out 1
run 1
him 1
so 1
they 1
had 1
it 1
nip 1
and 1
tuck 1
for 1
five 1
mile 1
or 1
more 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
a 1
gaining 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
so 1
at 1
last 1
Bud 1
seen 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
any 1
use 1
so 1
he 1
stopped 1
and 1
faced 1
around 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
bullet 1
holes 1
in 1
front 1
you 1
know 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
he 1
rode 1
up 1
and 1
shot 1
him 1
down 1
But 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
git 1
much 1
chance 1
to 1
enjoy 1
his 1
luck 1
for 1
inside 1
of 1
a 1
week 1
our 1
folks 1
laid 1
him 1
out 1
I 1
reckon 1
that 1
old 1
man 1
was 1
a 1
coward 1
Buck 1
I 1
reckon 1
he 1
warn 1
t 1
a 1
coward 1
Not 1
by 1
a 1
blame 1
sight 1
There 1
ain 1
t 1

coward 1
amongst 1
them 1
Shepherdsons 1
not 1
a 1
one 1
And 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
cowards 1
amongst 1
the 1
Grangerfords 1
either 1
Why 1
that 1
old 1
man 1
kep 1
up 1
his 1
end 1
in 1
a 1
fight 1
one 1
day 1
for 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
against 1
three 1
Grangerfords 1
and 1
come 1
out 1
winner 1
They 1
was 1
all 1
a 1
horseback 1
he 1
lit 1
off 1
of 1
his 1
horse 1
and 1
got 1
behind 1
a 1
little 1
woodpile 1
and 1
kep 1
his 1
horse 1
before 1
him 1
to 1
stop 1
the 1
bullets 1
but 1
the 1
Grangerfords 1
stayed 1
on 1
their 1
horses 1
and 1
capered 1
around 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
and 1
peppered 1
away 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
peppered 1
away 1
at 1
them 1
Him 1
and 1
his 1
horse 1
both 1
went 1
home 1
pretty 1
leaky 1
and 1
crippled 1
but 1
the 1
Grangerfords 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
fetched 1
home 1

one 1
of 1

amongst 1
them 1
Shepherdsons 1
becuz 1

kind 1
Next 1
Sunday 1
we 1
all 1
went 1
to 1
church 1
about 1
three 1
mile 1
everybody 1
a 1
horseback 1
The 1
men 1
took 1
their 1
guns 1
along 1
so 1
did 1
Buck 1
and 1
kept 1
them 1
between 1
their 1
knees 1
or 1
stood 1
them 1
handy 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
The 1
Shepherdsons 1
done 1
the 1
same 1
It 1
was 1
pretty 1
ornery 1
preaching 1
all 1
about 1
brotherly 1
love 1
and 1
such 1
like 1
tiresomeness 1
but 1
everybody 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
sermon 1
and 1
they 1
all 1
talked 1
it 1
over 1
going 1
home 1
and 1
had 1
such 1
a 1
powerful 1
lot 1
to 1
say 1
about 1
faith 1
and 1
good 1
works 1
and 1
free 1
grace 1
and 1
preforeordestination 1
and 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
all 1
that 1
it 1
did 1
seem 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
roughest 1
Sundays 1
I 1
had 1
run 1
across 1
yet 1
About 1
an 1
hour 1
after 1
dinner 1
everybody 1
was 1
dozing 1
around 1
some 1
in 1
their 1
chairs 1
and 1
some 1
in 1
their 1
rooms 1
and 1
it 1
got 1
to 1
be 1
pretty 1
dull 1
Buck 1
and 1
a 1
dog 1
was 1
stretched 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
grass 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
sound 1
asleep 1
I 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
our 1
room 1
and 1
judged 1
I 1
would 1
take 1
a 1
nap 1
myself 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
sweet 1
Miss 1
Sophia 1
standing 1
in 1
her 1
door 1
which 1
was 1
next 1
to 1
ours 1
and 1
she 1
took 1
me 1
in 1
her 1
room 1
and 1
shut 1
the 1
door 1
very 1
soft 1
and 1
asked 1
me 1
if 1
I 1
liked 1
her 1
and 1
I 1
said 1
I 1
did 1
and 1
she 1
asked 1
me 1
if 1
I 1
would 1
do 1
something 1
for 1
her 1
and 1
not 1
tell 1
anybody 1
and 1
I 1
said 1
I 1
would 1
Then 1
she 1
said 1
she 1
d 1
forgot 1
her 1
Testament 1
and 1
left 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
seat 1
at 1
church 1
between 1
two 1
other 1
books 1
and 1
would 1
I 1
slip 1
out 1
quiet 1
and 1
go 1
there 1
and 1
fetch 1
it 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
not 1
say 1
nothing 1
to 1
nobody 1
I 1
said 1
I 1
would 1
So 1
I 1
slid 1
out 1
and 1
slipped 1
off 1
up 1
the 1
road 1
and 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
anybody 1
at 1
the 1
church 1
except 1
maybe 1
a 1
hog 1
or 1
two 1
for 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
any 1
lock 1
on 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
hogs 1
likes 1
a 1
puncheon 1
floor 1
in 1
summer 1
time 1
because 1
it 1
s 1
cool 1
If 1
you 1
notice 1
most 1
folks 1
don 1
t 1
go 1
to 1
church 1
only 1
when 1
they 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
but 1
a 1
hog 1
is 1
different 1
Says 1
I 1
to 1
myself 1
something 1
s 1
up 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
natural 1
for 1
a 1
girl 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
sweat 1
about 1
a 1
Testament 1
So 1
I 1
give 1
it 1
a 1
shake 1
and 1
out 1
drops 1
a 1
little 1
piece 1
of 1
paper 1
with 1
HALF 1
PAST 1
TWO 1
wrote 1
on 1
it 1
with 1
a 1
pencil 1
I 1
ransacked 1
it 1
but 1
couldn 1
t 1
find 1
anything 1
else 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
make 1
anything 1
out 1
of 1
that 1
so 1
I 1
put 1
the 1
paper 1
in 1
the 1
book 1
again 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
got 1
home 1
and 1
upstairs 1
there 1
was 1
Miss 1
Sophia 1
in 1
her 1
door 1
waiting 1
for 1
me 1
She 1
pulled 1
me 1
in 1
and 1
shut 1
the 1
door 1
then 1
she 1
looked 1
in 1
the 1
Testament 1
till 1
she 1
found 1
the 1
paper 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
she 1
read 1
it 1
she 1
looked 1
glad 1
and 1
before 1
a 1
body 1
could 1
think 1
she 1
grabbed 1
me 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
squeeze 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
was 1
the 1
best 1
boy 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
not 1
to 1
tell 1
anybody 1
She 1
was 1
mighty 1
red 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
and 1
her 1
eyes 1
lighted 1
up 1
and 1
it 1
made 1
her 1
powerful 1
pretty 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
astonished 1
but 1
when 1
I 1
got 1
my 1
breath 1
I 1
asked 1
her 1
what 1
the 1
paper 1
was 1
about 1
and 1
she 1
asked 1
me 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
read 1
it 1
and 1
I 1
said 1
no 1
and 1
she 1
asked 1
me 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
read 1
writing 1
and 1
I 1
told 1
her 1
no 1
only 1
coarse 1
hand 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
said 1
the 1
paper 1
warn 1
t 1
anything 1
but 1
a 1
book 1
mark 1
to 1
keep 1
her 1
place 1
and 1
I 1
might 1
go 1
and 1
play 1
now 1
I 1
went 1
off 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
river 1
studying 1
over 1
this 1
thing 1
and 1
pretty 1
soon 1
I 1
noticed 1
that 1
my 1
nigger 1
was 1
following 1
along 1
behind 1
When 1
we 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
he 1
looked 1
back 1
and 1
around 1
a 1
second 1
and 1
then 1
comes 1
a 1
running 1
and 1
says 1
Mars 1
Jawge 1
if 1
you 1
ll 1
come 1
down 1
into 1
de 1
swamp 1
I 1
ll 1
show 1
you 1
a 1
whole 1
stack 1
o 1
water 1
moccasins 1
Thinks 1
I 1
that 1
s 1
mighty 1
curious 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
yesterday 1
He 1
oughter 1

moccasins 1
enough 1
to 1
go 1
around 1
hunting 1
for 1
them 1
What 1
is 1
he 1
up 1
to 1
anyway 1
So 1
I 1
says 1
All 1
right 1
trot 1
ahead 1
I 1
followed 1
a 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
then 1
he 1
struck 1
out 1
over 1
the 1
swamp 1
and 1
waded 1
ankle 1
deep 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
another 1
half 1
mile 1
We 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
little 1
flat 1
piece 1
of 1
land 1
which 1
was 1
dry 1
and 1
very 1
thick 1
with 1
trees 1
and 1
bushes 1
and 1
vines 1
and 1
he 1
says 1
You 1

Then 1
he 1
slopped 1
right 1
along 1
and 1
went 1
away 1
and 1
pretty 1
soon 1
the 1
trees 1
hid 1

I 1
poked 1
into 1

place 1

a 1
little 1
open 1
patch 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
a 1
bedroom 1
all 1
hung 1
around 1
with 1
vines 1
and 1

By 1
and 1
by 1
I 1
begin 1
to 1
hear 1
guns 1
a 1
good 1
ways 1
off 1
When 1
I 1
come 1
in 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
log 1
store 1
and 1
the 1
woodpile 1
where 1
the 1
steamboats 1
lands 1
I 1
worked 1
along 1
under 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
brush 1
till 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
a 1
good 1
place 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
clumb 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
forks 1
of 1
a 1
cottonwood 1
that 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
reach 1
and 1
watched 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
wood 1
rank 1
four 1
foot 1
high 1
a 1
little 1
ways 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
first 1
I 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
hide 1
behind 1
that 1
but 1
maybe 1
it 1
was 1
luckier 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
There 1
was 1
four 1
or 1
five 1
men 1
cavorting 1
around 1
on 1
their 1
horses 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
place 1
before 1
the 1
log 1
store 1
cussing 1
and 1
yelling 1
and 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
at 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
young 1
chaps 1
that 1
was 1
behind 1
the 1
wood 1
rank 1
alongside 1
of 1
the 1
steamboat 1
landing 1
but 1
they 1
couldn 1
t 1
come 1
it 1
Every 1
time 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
showed 1
himself 1
on 1
the 1
river 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
woodpile 1
he 1
got 1
shot 1
at 1
The 1
two 1
boys 1
was 1
squatting 1
back 1
to 1
back 1
behind 1
the 1
pile 1
so 1
they 1
could 1
watch 1
both 1
ways 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
men 1
stopped 1
cavorting 1
around 1
and 1
yelling 1
They 1
started 1
riding 1
towards 1
the 1
store 1
then 1
up 1
gets 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
boys 1
draws 1
a 1
steady 1
bead 1
over 1
the 1
wood 1
rank 1
and 1
drops 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
saddle 1
All 1
the 1
men 1
jumped 1
off 1
of 1
their 1
horses 1
and 1
grabbed 1
the 1
hurt 1
one 1
and 1
started 1
to 1
carry 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
store 1
and 1
that 1
minute 1
the 1
two 1
boys 1
started 1
on 1
the 1
run 1
They 1
got 1
half 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
tree 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
before 1
the 1
men 1
noticed 1
Then 1
the 1
men 1
see 1
them 1
and 1
jumped 1
on 1
their 1
horses 1
and 1
took 1
out 1
after 1
them 1
They 1
gained 1
on 1
the 1
boys 1
but 1
it 1
didn 1
t 1
do 1
no 1
good 1
the 1
boys 1
had 1
too 1
good 1
a 1
start 1
they 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
woodpile 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
my 1
tree 1
and 1
slipped 1
in 1
behind 1
it 1
and 1
so 1
they 1
had 1
the 1
bulge 1
on 1
the 1
men 1
again 1
One 1
of 1
the 1
boys 1
was 1
Buck 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
was 1
a 1
slim 1
young 1
chap 1
about 1
nineteen 1
years 1
old 1
The 1
men 1
ripped 1
around 1
awhile 1
and 1
then 1
rode 1
away 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
they 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
I 1
sung 1
out 1
to 1
Buck 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
He 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
make 1
of 1
my 1
voice 1
coming 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
at 1
first 1
He 1
was 1
awful 1
surprised 1
He 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
watch 1
out 1
sharp 1
and 1
let 1
him 1
know 1
when 1
the 1
men 1
come 1
in 1
sight 1
again 1
said 1
they 1
was 1
up 1
to 1
some 1
devilment 1
or 1
other 1
wouldn 1
t 1
be 1
gone 1
long 1
I 1
wished 1
I 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
that 1
tree 1
but 1
I 1
dasn 1
t 1
come 1
down 1
Buck 1
begun 1
to 1
cry 1
and 1
rip 1
and 1
lowed 1
that 1
him 1
and 1
his 1
cousin 1
Joe 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
other 1
young 1
chap 1
would 1
make 1
up 1
for 1
this 1
day 1
yet 1
He 1
said 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
his 1
two 1
brothers 1
was 1
killed 1
and 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
of 1
the 1
enemy 1
Said 1
the 1
Shepherdsons 1
laid 1
for 1
them 1
in 1
ambush 1
Buck 1
said 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
brothers 1
ought 1
to 1
waited 1
for 1
their 1
relations 1
the 1
Shepherdsons 1
was 1
too 1
strong 1
for 1
them 1
I 1
asked 1
him 1
what 1
was 1
become 1
of 1
young 1
Harney 1
and 1
Miss 1
Sophia 1
He 1
said 1
they 1
d 1
got 1
across 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
was 1
safe 1
I 1
was 1
glad 1
of 1
that 1
but 1
the 1
way 1
Buck 1
did 1
take 1
on 1
because 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
manage 1
to 1
kill 1
Harney 1
that 1
day 1
he 1
shot 1
at 1
him 1
I 1
hain 1
t 1
ever 1
heard 1
anything 1
like 1
it 1
All 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
bang 3
goes 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
guns 1
the 1
men 1
had 1
slipped 1
around 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
come 1
in 1
from 1
behind 1
without 1
their 1
horses 1
The 1
boys 1
jumped 1
for 1
the 1
river 1
both 1
of 1
them 1
hurt 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
swum 1
down 1
the 1
current 1
the 1
men 1
run 1
along 1
the 1
bank 1
shooting 1
at 1
them 1
and 1
singing 1
out 1
Kill 1
them 1
kill 1
them 1
It 1
made 1
me 1
so 1
sick 1
I 1
most 1
fell 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
a 1
going 1
to 1
tell 1
all 1
that 1
happened 1
it 1
would 1
make 1
me 1
sick 1
again 1
if 1
I 1
was 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
I 1
wished 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
ever 1
come 1
ashore 1
that 1
night 1
to 1
see 1
such 1
things 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
ever 1
going 1
to 1
get 1
shut 1
of 1
them 1
lots 1
of 1
times 1
I 1
dream 1
about 1
them 1
I 1
stayed 1
in 1
the 1
tree 1
till 1
it 1
begun 1
to 1
get 1
dark 1
afraid 1
to 1
come 1
down 1
Sometimes 1
I 1
heard 1
guns 1
away 1
off 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
twice 1
I 1
seen 1
little 1
gangs 1
of 1
men 1
gallop 1
past 1
the 1
log 1
store 1
with 1
guns 1
so 1
I 1
reckoned 1
the 1
trouble 1
was 1
still 1
a 1
going 1
on 1
I 1
was 1
mighty 1
downhearted 1
so 1
I 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
ever 1
go 1
anear 1
that 1
house 1
again 1
because 1
I 1
reckoned 1
I 1
was 1
to 1
blame 1
somehow 1
I 1
judged 1
that 2
piece 1
of 1
paper 1
meant 1
that 1
Miss 1
Sophia 1
was 1
to 1
meet 1
Harney 1
somewheres 1
at 1
half 1
past 1
two 1
and 1
run 1
off 1
and 1
I 1
judged 1
I 1
ought 1
to 1
told 1
her 1
father 1
about 1
that 1
paper 1
and 1
the 1
curious 1
way 1
she 1
acted 1
and 1
then 1
maybe 1
he 1
would 1
a 1
locked 1
her 1
up 1
and 1
this 1
awful 1
mess 1
wouldn 1
t 1
ever 1
happened 1
When 1
I 1
got 1
down 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
I 1
crept 1
along 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
bank 1
a 1
piece 1
and 1
found 1
the 1
two 1
bodies 1
laying 1
in 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
tugged 1
at 1
them 1
till 1
I 1
got 1
them 1
ashore 1
then 1
I 1
covered 1
up 1
their 1
faces 1
and 1
got 1
away 1
as 1
quick 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
I 1
cried 1
a 1
little 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
covering 1
up 1
Buck 1
s 1
face 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
mighty 1
good 1
to 1
me 1
It 1
was 1
just 1
dark 1
now 1
I 1
never 1
went 1
near 1
the 1
house 1
but 1
struck 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
made 1
for 1
the 1
swamp 1
Jim 1
warn 1
t 1
on 1
his 1
island 1
so 1
I 1
tramped 1
off 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
for 1
the 1
crick 1
and 1
crowded 1
through 1
the 1
willows 1
red 1
hot 1
to 1
jump 1
aboard 1
and 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
that 1
awful 1
country 1
The 1
raft 1
was 1
gone 1
My 1
souls 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
scared 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
get 1
my 1
breath 1
for 1
most 1
a 1
minute 1
Then 1
I 1
raised 1
a 1
yell 1
A 1
voice 1
not 1
twenty 1
five 1
foot 1
from 1
me 1
says 1
Good 1

Doan 1

It 1
was 1
Jim 1
s 1
voice 1
nothing 1
ever 1
sounded 1
so 1
good 1
before 1
I 1
run 1
along 1
the 1
bank 1
a 1
piece 1
and 1
got 1
aboard 1
and 1
Jim 1
he 1
grabbed 1
me 1
and 1
hugged 1
me 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
He 1
says 1

but 1
just 1
shove 1
off 1
for 1
the 1
big 1
water 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
ever 1
you 1
can 1
I 1
never 1
felt 1
easy 1
till 1
the 1
raft 1
was 1
two 1
mile 1
below 1
there 1
and 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
Mississippi 1
Then 1
we 1
hung 1
up 1
our 1
signal 1
lantern 1
and 1
judged 1
that 1
we 1
was 1
free 1
and 1
safe 1
once 1
more 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
had 1
a 1
bite 1
to 1
eat 1
since 1
yesterday 1
so 1
Jim 1
he 1
got 1
out 1
some 1
corn 1
dodgers 1
and 1
buttermilk 1
and 1
pork 1
and 1
cabbage 1
and 1
greens 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
so 1
good 1
when 1
it 1
s 1
cooked 1
right 1
and 1
whilst 1
I 1
eat 1
my 1
supper 1
we 1
talked 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
time 1
I 1
was 1
powerful 1
glad 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
feuds 1
and 1
so 1
was 1
Jim 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
swamp 1
We 1
said 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
home 1
like 1
a 1
raft 1
after 1
all 1
Other 1
places 1
do 1
seem 1
so 1
cramped 1
up 1
and 1
smothery 1
but 1
a 1
raft 1
don 1
t 1
You 1
feel 1
mighty 1
free 1
and 1
easy 1
and 1
comfortable 1
on 1
a 1
raft 1
CHAPTER 1
XIX 1
TWO 1
or 1
three 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
went 1
by 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
might 1
say 1
they 1
swum 1
by 1
they 1
slid 1
along 1
so 1
quiet 1
and 1
smooth 1
and 1
lovely 1
Here 1
is 1
the 1
way 1
we 1
put 1
in 1
the 1
time 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
monstrous 1
big 1
river 1
down 1
there 1
sometimes 1
a 1
mile 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
wide 1
we 1
run 1
nights 1
and 1
laid 1
up 1
and 1
hid 1
daytimes 1
soon 1
as 1
night 1
was 1
most 1
gone 1
we 1
stopped 1
navigating 1
and 1
tied 1
up 1
nearly 1
always 1
in 1
the 1
dead 1
water 1
under 1
a 1
towhead 1
and 1
then 1
cut 1
young 1
cottonwoods 1
and 1
willows 1
and 1
hid 1
the 1
raft 1
with 1
them 1
Then 1
we 1
set 1
out 1
the 1
lines 1
Next 1
we 1
slid 1
into 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
swim 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
freshen 1
up 1
and 1
cool 1
off 1
then 1
we 1
set 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
sandy 1
bottom 1
where 1
the 1
water 1
was 1
about 1
knee 1
deep 1
and 1
watched 1
the 1
daylight 1
come 1
Not 1
a 1
sound 1
anywheres 1
perfectly 1
still 1
just 1
like 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
was 1
asleep 1
only 1
sometimes 1
the 1
bullfrogs 1
a 1
cluttering 1
maybe 1
The 1
first 1
thing 1
to 1
see 1
looking 1
away 1
over 1
the 1
water 1
was 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
dull 1
line 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
woods 1
on 1
t 1
other 1
side 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
make 1
nothing 1
else 1
out 1
then 1
a 1
pale 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
then 1
more 1
paleness 1
spreading 1
around 1
then 1
the 1
river 1
softened 1
up 1
away 1
off 1
and 1
warn 1
t 1
black 1
any 1
more 1
but 1
gray 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
little 1
dark 1
spots 1
drifting 1
along 1
ever 1
so 1
far 1
away 1
trading 1
scows 1
and 1
such 1
things 1
and 1
long 1
black 1
streaks 1
rafts 1
sometimes 1
you 1
could 1
hear 1
a 1
sweep 1
screaking 1
or 1
jumbled 1
up 1
voices 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
still 1
and 1
sounds 1
come 1
so 1
far 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
a 1
streak 1
on 1
the 1
water 1
which 1
you 1
know 1
by 1
the 1
look 1
of 1
the 1
streak 1
that 1
there 1
s 1
a 1
snag 1
there 1
in 1
a 1
swift 1
current 1
which 1
breaks 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
makes 1
that 1
streak 1
look 1
that 1
way 1
and 1
you 1
see 1
the 1
mist 1
curl 1
up 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
the 1
east 1
reddens 1
up 1
and 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
you 1
make 1
out 1
a 1
log 1
cabin 1
in 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
away 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
on 1
t 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
being 1
a 1
woodyard 1
likely 1
and 1
piled 1
by 1
them 1
cheats 1
so 1
you 1
can 1
throw 1
a 1
dog 1
through 1
it 1
anywheres 1
then 1
the 1
nice 1
breeze 1
springs 1
up 1
and 1
comes 1
fanning 1
you 1
from 1
over 1
there 1
so 1
cool 1
and 1
fresh 1
and 1
sweet 1
to 1
smell 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
the 1
flowers 1
but 1
sometimes 1
not 1
that 1
way 1
because 1
they 1
ve 1
left 1
dead 1
fish 1
laying 1
around 1
gars 1
and 1
such 1
and 1
they 1
do 1
get 1
pretty 1
rank 1
and 1
next 1
you 1
ve 1
got 1
the 1
full 1
day 1
and 1
everything 1
smiling 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
the 1
song 1
birds 1
just 1
going 1
it 1
A 1
little 1
smoke 1
couldn 1
t 1
be 1
noticed 1
now 1
so 1
we 1
would 1
take 1
some 1
fish 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
lines 1
and 1
cook 1
up 1
a 1
hot 1
breakfast 1
And 1
afterwards 1
we 1
would 1
watch 1
the 1
lonesomeness 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
kind 1
of 1
lazy 1
along 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
lazy 1
off 1
to 1
sleep 1
Wake 1
up 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
look 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
done 1
it 1
and 1
maybe 1
see 1
a 1
steamboat 1
coughing 1
along 1
up 1
stream 1
so 1
far 1
off 1
towards 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
tell 1
nothing 1
about 1
her 1
only 1
whether 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
stern 1
wheel 1
or 1
side 1
wheel 1
then 1
for 1
about 1
an 1
hour 1
there 1
wouldn 1
t 1
be 1
nothing 1
to 1
hear 1
nor 1
nothing 1
to 1
see 1
just 1
solid 1
lonesomeness 1
Next 1
you 1
d 1
see 1
a 1
raft 1
sliding 1
by 1
away 1
off 1
yonder 1
and 1
maybe 1
a 1
galoot 1
on 1
it 1
chopping 1
because 1
they 1
re 1
most 1
always 1
doing 1
it 1
on 1
a 1
raft 1
you 1
d 1
see 1
the 1
axe 1
flash 1
and 1
come 1
down 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
hear 1
nothing 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
axe 1
go 1
up 1
again 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
it 1
s 1
above 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
head 1
then 1
you 1
hear 1
the 1
k 1
chunk 1
it 1
had 1
took 1
all 1
that 1
time 1
to 1
come 1
over 1
the 1
water 1
So 1
we 1
would 1
put 1
in 1
the 1
day 1
lazying 1
around 1
listening 1
to 1
the 1
stillness 1
Once 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
thick 1
fog 1
and 1
the 1
rafts 1
and 1
things 1
that 1
went 1
by 1
was 1
beating 1
tin 1
pans 1
so 1
the 1
steamboats 1
wouldn 1
t 1
run 1
over 1
them 1
A 1
scow 1
or 1
a 1
raft 1
went 1
by 1
so 1
close 1
we 1
could 1
hear 1
them 1
talking 1
and 1
cussing 1
and 1
laughing 1
heard 1
them 1
plain 1
but 1
we 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
them 1
it 1
made 1
you 1
feel 1
crawly 1
it 1
was 1
like 1
spirits 1
carrying 1
on 1
that 1
way 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
Jim 1
said 1
he 1
believed 1
it 1
was 1
spirits 1
but 1
I 1
says 1
No 1
spirits 1
wouldn 1
t 1
say 1
Dern 1
the 1
dern 1
fog 1
Soon 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
night 1
out 1
we 1
shoved 1
when 1
we 1
got 1
her 1
out 1
to 1
about 1
the 1
middle 1
we 1
let 1
her 1
alone 1
and 1
let 1
her 1
float 1
wherever 1
the 1
current 1
wanted 1
her 1
to 1
then 1
we 1
lit 1
the 1
pipes 1
and 1
dangled 1
our 1
legs 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
talked 1
about 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
things 1
we 1
was 1
always 1
naked 1
day 1
and 1
night 1
whenever 1
the 1
mosquitoes 1
would 1
let 1
us 1
the 1
new 1
clothes 1
Buck 1
s 1
folks 1
made 1
for 1
me 1
was 1
too 1
good 1
to 1
be 1
comfortable 1
and 1
besides 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
go 1
much 1
on 1
clothes 1
nohow 1
Sometimes 1
we 1
d 1
have 1
that 1
whole 1
river 1
all 1
to 1
ourselves 1
for 1
the 1
longest 1
time 1
Yonder 1
was 1
the 1
banks 1
and 1
the 1
islands 1
across 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
maybe 1
a 1
spark 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
candle 1
in 1
a 1
cabin 1
window 1
and 1
sometimes 1
on 1
the 1
water 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
a 1
spark 1
or 1
two 1
on 1
a 1
raft 1
or 1
a 1
scow 1
you 1
know 1
and 1
maybe 1
you 1
could 1
hear 1
a 1
fiddle 1
or 1
a 1
song 1
coming 1
over 1
from 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
crafts 1
It 1
s 1
lovely 1
to 1
live 1
on 1
a 1
raft 1
We 1
had 1
the 1
sky 1
up 1
there 1
all 1
speckled 1
with 1
stars 1
and 1
we 1
used 1
to 1
lay 1
on 1
our 1
backs 1
and 1
look 1
up 1
at 1
them 1
and 1
discuss 1
about 1
whether 1
they 1
was 1
made 1
or 1
only 1
just 1
happened 1
Jim 1
he 1
allowed 1
they 1
was 1
made 1
but 1
I 1
allowed 1
they 1
happened 1
I 1
judged 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
took 1
too 1
long 1
to 1
make 1
so 1
many 1
Jim 1
said 1
the 1
moon 1
could 1
a 1
laid 1
them 1
well 1
that 1
looked 1
kind 1
of 1
reasonable 1
so 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
say 1
nothing 1
against 1
it 1
because 1
I 1
ve 1
seen 1
a 1
frog 1
lay 1
most 1
as 1
many 1
so 1
of 1
course 1
it 1
could 1
be 1
done 1
We 1
used 1
to 1
watch 1
the 1
stars 1
that 1
fell 1
too 1
and 1
see 1
them 1
streak 1
down 1
Jim 1
allowed 1
they 1
d 1
got 1
spoiled 1
and 1
was 1
hove 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
nest 1
Once 1
or 1
twice 1
of 1
a 1
night 1
we 1
would 1
see 1
a 1
steamboat 1
slipping 1
along 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
and 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
would 1
belch 1
a 1
whole 1
world 1
of 1
sparks 1
up 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
chimbleys 1
and 1
they 1
would 1
rain 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
look 1
awful 1
pretty 1
then 1
she 1
would 1
turn 1
a 1
corner 1
and 1
her 1
lights 1
would 1
wink 1
out 1
and 1
her 1
powwow 1
shut 1
off 1
and 1
leave 1
the 1
river 1
still 1
again 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
her 1
waves 1
would 1
get 1
to 1
us 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
after 1
she 1
was 1
gone 1
and 1
joggle 1
the 1
raft 1
a 1
bit 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
you 1
wouldn 1
t 1
hear 1
nothing 1
for 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
tell 1
how 1
long 1
except 1
maybe 1
frogs 1
or 1
something 1
After 1
midnight 1
the 1
people 1
on 1
shore 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
and 1
then 1
for 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
hours 1
the 1
shores 1
was 1
black 1
no 1
more 1
sparks 1
in 1
the 1
cabin 1
windows 1
These 1
sparks 1
was 1
our 1
clock 1
the 1
first 1
one 1
that 1
showed 1
again 1
meant 1
morning 1
was 1
coming 1
so 1
we 1
hunted 1
a 1
place 1
to 1
hide 1
and 1
tie 1
up 1
right 1
away 1
One 1
morning 1
about 1
daybreak 1
I 1
found 1
a 1
canoe 1
and 1
crossed 1
over 1
a 1
chute 1
to 1
the 1
main 1
shore 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
two 1
hundred 1
yards 1
and 1
paddled 1
about 1
a 1
mile 1
up 1
a 1
crick 1
amongst 1
the 1
cypress 1
woods 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
get 1
some 1
berries 1
Just 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
passing 1
a 1
place 1
where 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
cowpath 1
crossed 1
the 1
crick 1
here 1
comes 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
men 1
tearing 1
up 1
the 1
path 1
as 1
tight 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
foot 1
it 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
goner 1
for 1
whenever 1
anybody 1
was 1
after 1
anybody 1
I 1
judged 1
it 1
was 1
me 1
or 1
maybe 1
Jim 1
I 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
dig 1
out 1
from 1
there 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
but 1
they 1
was 1
pretty 1
close 1
to 1
me 1
then 1
and 1
sung 1
out 1
and 1
begged 1
me 1
to 1
save 1
their 1
lives 1
said 1
they 1
hadn 1
t 1
been 1
doing 1
nothing 1
and 1
was 1
being 1
chased 1
for 1
it 1
said 1
there 1
was 1
men 1
and 1
dogs 1
a 1
coming 1
They 1
wanted 1
to 1
jump 1
right 1
in 1
but 1
I 1
says 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
do 1
it 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
hear 1
the 1
dogs 1
and 1
horses 1
yet 1
you 1
ve 1
got 1
time 1
to 1
crowd 1
through 1
the 1
brush 1
and 1
get 1
up 1
the 1
crick 1
a 1
little 1
ways 1
then 1
you 1
take 1
to 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
wade 1
down 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
get 1
in 1
that 1
ll 1
throw 1
the 1
dogs 1
off 1
the 1
scent 1
They 1
done 1
it 1
and 1
soon 1
as 1
they 1
was 1
aboard 1
I 1
lit 1
out 1
for 1
our 1
towhead 1
and 1
in 1
about 1
five 1
or 1
ten 1
minutes 1
we 1
heard 1
the 1
dogs 1
and 1
the 1
men 1
away 1
off 1
shouting 1
We 1
heard 1
them 1
come 1
along 1
towards 1
the 1
crick 1
but 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
them 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
stop 1
and 1
fool 1
around 1
a 1
while 1
then 1
as 1
we 1
got 1
further 1
and 1
further 1
away 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
we 1
couldn 1
t 1
hardly 1
hear 1
them 1
at 1
all 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
we 1
had 1
left 1
a 1
mile 1
of 1
woods 1
behind 1
us 1
and 1
struck 1
the 1
river 1
everything 1
was 1
quiet 1
and 1
we 1
paddled 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
towhead 1
and 1
hid 1
in 1
the 1
cottonwoods 1
and 1
was 1
safe 1
One 1
of 1
these 1
fellows 1
was 1
about 1
seventy 1
or 1
upwards 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
bald 1
head 1
and 1
very 1
gray 1
whiskers 1
He 1
had 1
an 1
old 1
battered 1
up 1
slouch 1
hat 1
on 1
and 1
a 1
greasy 1
blue 1
woollen 1
shirt 1
and 1
ragged 1
old 1
blue 1
jeans 1
britches 1
stuffed 1
into 1
his 1
boot 1
tops 1
and 1
home 1
knit 1
galluses 1
no 1
he 1
only 1
had 1
one 1
He 1
had 1
an 1
old 1
long 1
tailed 1
blue 1
jeans 1
coat 1
with 1
slick 1
brass 1
buttons 1
flung 1
over 1
his 1
arm 1
and 1
both 1
of 1
them 1
had 1
big 1
fat 1
ratty 1
looking 1
carpet 1
bags 1
The 1
other 1
fellow 1
was 1
about 1
thirty 1
and 1
dressed 1
about 1
as 1
ornery 1
After 1
breakfast 1
we 1
all 1
laid 1
off 1
and 1
talked 1
and 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
that 1
come 1
out 1
was 1
that 1
these 1
chaps 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
one 1
another 1
What 1
got 1
you 1
into 1
trouble 1
says 1
the 1
baldhead 1
to 1
t 1
other 1
chap 1
Well 1
I 1
d 1
been 1
selling 1
an 1
article 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
tartar 1
off 1
the 1
teeth 1
and 1
it 1
does 1
take 1
it 1
off 1
too 1
and 1
generly 1
the 1
enamel 1
along 1
with 1
it 1
but 1
I 1
stayed 1
about 1
one 1
night 1
longer 1
than 1
I 1
ought 1
to 1
and 1
was 1
just 1
in 1
the 1
act 1
of 1
sliding 1
out 1
when 1
I 1
ran 1
across 1
you 1
on 1
the 1
trail 1
this 1
side 1
of 1
town 1
and 1
you 1
told 1
me 1
they 1
were 1
coming 1
and 1
begged 1
me 1
to 1
help 1
you 1
to 1
get 1
off 1
So 1
I 1
told 1
you 1
I 1
was 1
expecting 1
trouble 1
myself 1
and 1
would 1
scatter 1
out 1
with 1
you 1
That 1
s 1
the 1
whole 1
yarn 1
what 1
s 1
yourn 1
Well 1
I 1
d 1
ben 1
a 1
running 1
a 1
little 1
temperance 1
revival 1
thar 1
bout 1
a 1
week 1
and 1
was 1
the 1

too 1
Then 1
the 1
baldhead 1
says 1
No 1
you 1

it 1
Yes 1
My 1
great 1
grandfather 1
eldest 1
son 1
of 1
the 1
Duke 1
of 1
Bridgewater 1
fled 1
to 1
this 1
country 1
about 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
last 1
century 1
to 1
breathe 1
the 1
pure 1
air 1
of 1
freedom 1
married 1
here 1
and 1
died 1
leaving 1
a 1
son 1
his 1
own 1
father 1
dying 1
about 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
The 1
second 1
son 1
of 1
the 1
late 1
duke 1
seized 1
the 1
titles 1
and 1
estates 1
the 1
infant 1
real 1
duke 1
was 1
ignored 1
I 1
am 1
the 1
lineal 1
descendant 1
of 1
that 1
infant 1
I 1
am 1
the 1
rightful 1
Duke 1
of 1
Bridgewater 1
and 1
here 1
am 1
I 1
forlorn 1
torn 1
from 1
my 1
high 1
estate 1
hunted 1
of 1
men 1
despised 1
by 1
the 1
cold 1
world 1
ragged 1
worn 1
heart 1
broken 1
and 1
degraded 1
to 1
the 1
companionship 1
of 1
felons 1
on 1
a 1
raft 1
Jim 1
pitied 1
him 1
ever 1
so 1
much 1
and 1
so 1
did 1
I 1
We 1
tried 1
to 1
comfort 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
much 1
use 1
he 1
couldn 1
t 1
be 1
much 1
comforted 1
said 1
if 1
we 1
was 1
a 1
mind 1
to 1
acknowledge 1
him 1
that 1
would 1
do 1
him 1
more 1
good 1
than 1
most 1
anything 1
else 1
so 1
we 1
said 1
we 1
would 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
tell 1
us 1
how 1
He 1
said 1
we 1
ought 1
to 1
bow 1
when 1
we 1
spoke 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
say 1
Your 1
Grace 1
or 1
My 1
Lord 1
or 1
Your 1
Lordship 1
and 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
mind 1
it 1
if 1
we 1
called 1
him 1
plain 1
Bridgewater 1
which 1
he 1
said 1
was 1
a 1
title 1
anyway 1
and 1
not 1
a 1
name 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
us 1
ought 1
to 1
wait 1
on 1
him 1
at 1
dinner 1
and 1
do 1
any 1
little 1
thing 1
for 1
him 1
he 1
wanted 1
done 1
Well 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
easy 1
so 1
we 1
done 1
it 1
All 1
through 1
dinner 1
Jim 1
stood 1
around 1
and 1
waited 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
says 1
Will 1

some 1
o 1
dis 1
or 1
some 1
o 1
dat 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
and 1
a 1
body 1
could 1
see 1
it 1
was 1
mighty 1
pleasing 1
to 1
him 1
But 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
got 1
pretty 1
silent 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
didn 1
t 1
have 1
much 1
to 1
say 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
look 1
pretty 1
comfortable 1
over 1
all 1
that 1
petting 1
that 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
around 1
that 1
duke 1
He 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
something 1
on 1
his 1
mind 1
So 1
along 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
he 1
says 1

the 1

of 1
sobbing 1
To 1

bitter 1
death 1
He 1
took 1
the 1

by 1

King 1

Well 1

So 1

before 1
with 1
the 1

and 1
tried 1
to 1

But 1

all 1
could 1
do 1
him 1
any 1
good 1
though 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
often 1
made 1
him 1
feel 1
easier 1
and 1
better 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
if 1
people 1
treated 1
him 1
according 1
to 1
his 1
rights 1
and 1
got 1
down 1
on 1
one 1
knee 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
always 1
called 1
him 1
Your 1
Majesty 1
and 1
waited 1
on 1

first 1
at 1
meals 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
set 1
down 1
in 1
his 1
presence 1
till 1

So 1
Jim 1

majestying 1
him 1
and 1
doing 1
this 1
and 1

long 1
to 1
make 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
that 1
these 1
liars 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
kings 1
nor 1
dukes 1
at 1
all 1
but 1
just 1
low 1
down 1
humbugs 1
and 1
frauds 1
But 1
I 1
never 1
said 1
nothing 1
never 1
let 1
on 1
kept 1
it 1
to 1
myself 1
it 1
s 1
the 1
best 1
way 1
then 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
have 1
no 1
quarrels 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
get 1
into 1
no 1
trouble 1
If 1
they 1
wanted 1
us 1
to 1
call 1
them 1
kings 1
and 1
dukes 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
no 1
objections 1
long 1
as 1
it 1
would 1
keep 1
peace 1
in 1
the 1
family 1
and 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
tell 1
Jim 1
so 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
tell 1
him 1
If 1
I 1
never 1
learnt 1
nothing 1
else 1
out 1
of 1
pap 1
I 1
learnt 1
that 1
the 1
best 1
way 1
to 1
get 1
along 1
with 1
his 1
kind 1
of 1
people 1
is 1
to 1
let 1
them 1
have 1
their 1
own 1
way 1
CHAPTER 1
XX 1
THEY 1
asked 1
us 1
considerable 1
many 1
questions 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
we 1
covered 1
up 1
the 1
raft 1
that 1
way 1
for 1
and 1
laid 1
by 1
in 1
the 1
daytime 1
instead 1
of 1
running 1
was 1
Jim 1
a 1
runaway 1
nigger 1
Says 1
I 1
Goodness 1
sakes 1
would 1
a 1
runaway 1
nigger 1
run 1
south 1
No 1
they 1
allowed 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
account 1
for 1
things 1
some 1
way 1
so 1
I 1
says 1
My 1
folks 1
was 1
living 1
in 1
Pike 1
County 1
in 1
Missouri 1
where 1
I 1
was 1
born 1
and 1
they 1
all 1
died 1
off 1
but 1
me 1
and 1
pa 1
and 1
my 1
brother 1
Ike 1
Pa 1
he 1
lowed 1
he 1
d 1
break 1
up 1
and 1
go 1
down 1
and 1
live 1
with 1
Uncle 1
Ben 1
who 1
s 1
got 1
a 1
little 1
one 1
horse 1
place 1
on 1
the 1
river 1
forty 1
four 1
mile 1
below 1
Orleans 1
Pa 1
was 1
pretty 1
poor 1
and 1
had 1
some 1
debts 1
so 1
when 1
he 1
d 1
squared 1
up 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
nothing 1
left 1
but 1
sixteen 1
dollars 1
and 1
our 1
nigger 1
Jim 1
That 1
warn 1
t 1
enough 1
to 1
take 1
us 1
fourteen 1
hundred 1
mile 1
deck 1
passage 1
nor 1
no 1
other 1
way 1
Well 1
when 1
the 1
river 1
rose 1
pa 1
had 1
a 1
streak 1
of 1
luck 1
one 1
day 1
he 1
ketched 1
this 1
piece 1
of 1
a 1
raft 1
so 1
we 1
reckoned 1
we 1
d 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
Orleans 1
on 1
it 1
Pa 1
s 1
luck 1
didn 1
t 1
hold 1
out 1
a 1
steamboat 1
run 1
over 1
the 1
forrard 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
raft 1
one 1
night 1
and 1
we 1
all 1
went 1
overboard 1
and 1
dove 1
under 1
the 1
wheel 1
Jim 1
and 1
me 1
come 1
up 1
all 1
right 1
but 1
pa 1
was 1
drunk 1
and 1
Ike 1
was 1
only 1
four 1
years 1
old 1
so 1
they 1
never 1
come 1
up 1
no 1
more 1
Well 1
for 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
or 1
two 1
we 1
had 1
considerable 1
trouble 1
because 1
people 1
was 1
always 1
coming 1
out 1
in 1
skiffs 1
and 1
trying 1
to 1
take 1
Jim 1
away 1
from 1
me 1
saying 1
they 1
believed 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
runaway 1
nigger 1
We 1
don 1
t 1
run 1
daytimes 1
no 1
more 1
now 1
nights 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
bother 1
us 1
The 1
duke 1
says 1
Leave 1
me 1
alone 1
to 1
cipher 1
out 1
a 1
way 1
so 1
we 1
can 1
run 1
in 1
the 1
daytime 1
if 1
we 1
want 1
to 1
I 1
ll 1
think 1
the 1
thing 1
over 1
I 1
ll 1
invent 1
a 1
plan 1
that 1
ll 1
fix 1
it 1
We 1
ll 1
let 1
it 1
alone 1
for 1
to 1
day 1
because 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
by 1
that 1
town 1
yonder 1
in 1
daylight 1
it 1
mightn 1
t 1
be 1
healthy 1
Towards 1
night 1
it 1
begun 1
to 1
darken 1
up 1
and 1
look 1
like 1
rain 1
the 1
heat 1
lightning 1
was 1
squirting 1
around 1
low 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
and 1
the 1
leaves 1
was 1
beginning 1
to 1
shiver 1
it 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
pretty 1
ugly 1
it 1
was 1
easy 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
So 1
the 1
duke 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
went 1
to 1
overhauling 1
our 1
wigwam 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
the 1
beds 1
was 1
like 1
My 1
bed 1
was 1
a 1
straw 1
tick 1
better 1
than 1
Jim 1
s 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
corn 1
shuck 1
tick 1
there 1
s 1
always 1
cobs 1
around 1
about 1
in 1
a 1
shuck 1
tick 1
and 1
they 1
poke 1
into 1
you 1
and 1
hurt 1
and 1
when 1
you 1
roll 1
over 1
the 1
dry 1
shucks 1
sound 1
like 1
you 1
was 1
rolling 1
over 1
in 1
a 1
pile 1
of 1
dead 1
leaves 1
it 1
makes 1
such 1
a 1
rustling 1
that 1
you 1
wake 1
up 1
Well 1
the 1
duke 1
allowed 1
he 1
would 1
take 1
my 1
bed 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
allowed 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
He 1
says 1
I 1
should 1
a 1
reckoned 1
the 1
difference 1
in 1
rank 1
would 1
a 1
sejested 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
a 1
corn 1
shuck 1
bed 1
warn 1
t 1
just 1
fitten 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
sleep 1
on 1
Your 1
Grace 1
ll 1
take 1
the 1
shuck 1
bed 1
yourself 1
Jim 1
and 1
me 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
sweat 1
again 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
being 1
afraid 1
there 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
some 1
more 1
trouble 1
amongst 1
them 1
so 1
we 1
was 1
pretty 1
glad 1
when 1
the 1
duke 1
says 1
Tis 1
my 1
fate 1
to 1
be 1
always 1
ground 1
into 1
the 1
mire 1
under 1
the 1
iron 1
heel 1
of 1
oppression 1
Misfortune 1
has 1
broken 1
my 1
once 1
haughty 1
spirit 1
I 1
yield 1
I 1
submit 1
tis 1
my 1
fate 1
I 1
am 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
let 1
me 1
suffer 1
can 1
bear 1
it 1
We 1
got 1
away 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
good 1
and 1
dark 1
The 1
king 1
told 1
us 1
to 1
stand 1
well 1
out 1
towards 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
not 1
show 1
a 1
light 1
till 1
we 1
got 1
a 1
long 1
ways 1
below 1
the 1
town 1
We 1
come 1
in 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
bunch 1
of 1
lights 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
town 1
you 1
know 1
and 1
slid 1
by 1
about 1
a 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
out 1
all 1
right 1
When 1
we 1
was 1
three 1
quarters 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
below 1
we 1
hoisted 1
up 1
our 1
signal 1
lantern 1
and 1
about 1
ten 1
o 1
clock 1
it 1
come 1
on 1
to 1
rain 1
and 1
blow 1
and 1
thunder 1
and 1
lighten 1
like 1
everything 1
so 1
the 1
king 1
told 1
us 1
to 1
both 1
stay 1
on 1
watch 1
till 1
the 1
weather 1
got 1
better 1
then 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
crawled 1
into 1
the 1
wigwam 1
and 1
turned 1
in 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
It 1
was 1
my 1
watch 1
below 1
till 1
twelve 1
but 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
a 1
turned 1
in 1
anyway 1
if 1
I 1
d 1
had 1
a 1
bed 1
because 1
a 1
body 1
don 1
t 1
see 1
such 1
a 1
storm 1
as 1
that 1
every 1
day 1
in 1
the 1
week 1
not 1
by 1
a 1
long 1
sight 1
My 1
souls 1
how 1
the 1
wind 1
did 1
scream 1
along 1
And 1
every 1
second 1
or 1
two 1
there 1
d 1
come 1
a 1
glare 1
that 1
lit 1
up 1
the 1
white 1
caps 1
for 1
a 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
around 1
and 1
you 1
d 1
see 1
the 1
islands 1
looking 1
dusty 1
through 1
the 1
rain 1
and 1
the 1
trees 1
thrashing 1
around 1
in 1
the 1
wind 1
then 1
comes 1
a 1
H 1
WHACK 1
bum 2
bumble 1
umble 1
um 1
bum 4
and 1
the 1
thunder 1
would 1
go 1
rumbling 1
and 1
grumbling 1
away 1
and 1
quit 1
and 1
then 1
RIP 1
comes 1
another 1
flash 1
and 1
another 1
sockdolager 1
The 1
waves 1
most 1
washed 1
me 1
off 1
the 1
raft 1
sometimes 1
but 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
any 1
clothes 1
on 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
mind 1
We 1
didn 1
t 1
have 1
no 1
trouble 1
about 1
snags 1
the 1
lightning 1
was 1
glaring 1
and 1
flittering 1
around 1
so 1
constant 1
that 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
them 1
plenty 1
soon 1
enough 1
to 1
throw 1
her 1
head 1
this 1
way 1
or 1
that 1
and 1
miss 1
them 1
I 1
had 1
the 1
middle 1
watch 1
you 1
know 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
pretty 1
sleepy 1
by 1
that 1
time 1
so 1
Jim 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
stand 1
the 1
first 1
half 1
of 1
it 1
for 1
me 1
he 1
was 1
always 1
mighty 1
good 1
that 1
way 1
Jim 1
was 1
I 1
crawled 1
into 1
the 1
wigwam 1
but 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
had 1
their 1
legs 1
sprawled 1
around 1
so 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
show 1
for 1
me 1
so 1
I 1
laid 1
outside 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
mind 1
the 1
rain 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
warm 1
and 1
the 1
waves 1
warn 1
t 1
running 1
so 1
high 1
now 1
About 1
two 1
they 1
come 1
up 1
again 1
though 1
and 1
Jim 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
call 1
me 1
but 1
he 1
changed 1
his 1
mind 1
because 1
he 1
reckoned 1
they 1
warn 1
t 1
high 1
enough 1
yet 1
to 1
do 1
any 1
harm 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
mistaken 1
about 1
that 1
for 1
pretty 1
soon 1
all 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
along 1
comes 1
a 1
regular 1
ripper 1
and 1
washed 1
me 1
overboard 1
It 1
most 1
killed 1
Jim 1
a 1
laughing 1
He 1
was 1
the 1
easiest 1
nigger 1
to 1
laugh 1
that 1
ever 1
was 1
anyway 1
I 1
took 1
the 1
watch 1
and 1
Jim 1
he 1
laid 1
down 1
and 1
snored 1
away 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
storm 1
let 1
up 1
for 1
good 1
and 1
all 1
and 1
the 1
first 1
cabin 1
light 1
that 1
showed 1
I 1
rousted 1
him 1
out 1
and 1
we 1
slid 1
the 1
raft 1
into 1
hiding 1
quarters 1
for 1
the 1
day 1
The 1
king 1
got 1
out 1
an 1
old 1
ratty 1
deck 1
of 1
cards 1
after 1
breakfast 1
and 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
played 1
seven 1
up 1
a 1
while 1
five 1
cents 1
a 1
game 1
Then 1
they 1
got 1
tired 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
allowed 1
they 1
would 1
lay 1
out 1
a 1
campaign 1
as 1
they 1
called 1
it 1
The 1
duke 1
went 1
down 1
into 1
his 1
carpet 1
bag 1
and 1
fetched 1
up 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
little 1
printed 1
bills 1
and 1
read 1
them 1
out 1
loud 1
One 1
bill 1
said 1
The 1
celebrated 1
Dr 1
Armand 1
de 1
Montalban 1
of 1
Paris 1
would 1
lecture 1
on 1
the 1
Science 1
of 1
Phrenology 1
at 1
such 1
and 1
such 1
a 1
place 1
on 1
the 1
blank 1
day 1
of 1
blank 1
at 1
ten 1
cents 1
admission 1
and 1
furnish 1
charts 1
of 1
character 1
at 1
twenty 1
five 1
cents 1
apiece 1
The 1
duke 1
said 1
that 1
was 1
him 1
In 1
another 1
bill 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
world 1
renowned 1
Shakespearian 1
tragedian 1
Garrick 1
the 1
Younger 1
of 1
Drury 1
Lane 1
London 1
In 1
other 1
bills 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
other 1
names 1
and 1
done 1
other 1
wonderful 1
things 1
like 1
finding 1
water 1
and 1
gold 1
with 1
a 1
divining 1
rod 1
dissipating 1
witch 1
spells 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
he 1
says 1
But 1
the 1
histrionic 1
muse 1
is 1
the 1
darling 1
Have 1
you 1
ever 1
trod 1
the 1
boards 1
Royalty 1
No 1

the 1
king 1
You 1
shall 1

before 1

re 1
three 1
days 1

Fallen 1
Grandeur 1
says 1
the 1
duke 1
The 1
first 1
good 1
town 1

come 1
to 1

ll 1
hire 1
a 1
hall 1
and 1

the 1
sword 1
fight 1
in 1
Richard 1
III 1
and 1
the 1
balcony 1
scene 1
in 1
Romeo 1
and 1
Juliet 1
How 1
does 1
that 1
strike 1
you 1
I 1
m 1

the 1
hub 1
for 1

So 1
the 1
duke 1
he 1
told 1
him 1
all 1
about 1
who 1
Romeo 1
was 1
and 1
who 1
Juliet 1
was 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
used 1
to 1
being 1
Romeo 1
so 1
the 1
king 1

Juliet 1
But 1

The 1

So 1

We 1

about 1
a 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
fairly 1
dripping 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
most 1
awful 1
hot 1
day 1
There 1
was 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
a 1
thousand 1
people 1
there 1
from 1
twenty 1
mile 1
around 1
The 1
woods 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
teams 1
and 1
wagons 1
hitched 1
everywheres 1
feeding 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
wagon 1
troughs 1
and 1
stomping 1
to 1
keep 1
off 1
the 1
flies 1
There 1
was 1
sheds 1
made 1
out 1
of 1
poles 1
and 1
roofed 1
over 1
with 1
branches 1
where 1
they 1

The 1

under 1
the 1
same 1
kinds 1
of 1
sheds 1
only 1

crowds 1
of 1
people 1
The 1
benches 1

of 1
outside 1
slabs 1
of 1
logs 1
with 1
holes 1
bored 1
in 1
the 1
round 1
side 1
to 1
drive 1
sticks 1
into 1
for 1
legs 1
They 1
didn 1
t 1
have 1
no 1
backs 1
The 1
preachers 1
had 1
high 1
platforms 1
to 1
stand 1
on 1
at 1
one 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
sheds 1
The 1
women 1

Some 1

children 1

Some 1

was 1
knitting 1
and 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
young 1
folks 1

courting 1
on 1
the 1
sly 1
The 1
first 1
shed 1
we 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
preacher 1
was 1
lining 1
out 1
a 1
hymn 1
He 1
lined 1
out 1
two 1
lines 1
everybody 1

of 1
them 1
and 1
they 1

a 1
rousing 1
way 1
then 1
he 1
lined 1
out 1
two 1
more 1

and 1
so 1
on 1
The 1
people 1
woke 1
up 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
and 1
sung 1
louder 1
and 1
louder 1
and 1
towards 1
the 1
end 1
some 1
begun 1
to 1
groan 1
and 1
some 1
begun 1
to 1
shout 1
Then 1
the 1
preacher 1
begun 1
to 1
preach 1
and 1
begun 1
in 1
earnest 1
too 1
and 1
went 1
weaving 1
first 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
platform 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
other 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
leaning 1

time 1
and 1
shouting 1
his 1
words 1
out 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
might 1
and 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
would 1
hold 1

and 1

Folks 1

and 1
next 1
he 1
went 1
a 1
charging 1
up 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
platform 1
and 1
the 1
preacher 1
he 1
begged 1
him 1
to 1

to 1
the 1
people 1
and 1
he 1

He 1
told 1

pirate 1

a 1
pirate 1
for 1
thirty 1
years 1
out 1
in 1

Indian 1
Ocean 1
and 1
his 1
crew 1
was 1
thinned 1
out 1
considerable 1
last 1
spring 1
in 1
a 1
fight 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
home 1

fresh 1
men 1
and 1

to 1

last 1
night 1
and 1
put 1
ashore 1
off 1

a 1
steamboat 1
without 1
a 1
cent 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
glad 1
of 1
it 2
was 1
the 1
blessedest 1
thing 1
that 1
ever 1
happened 1
to 1
him 1
because 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
changed 1
man 1
now 1
and 1
happy 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
in 1
his 1
life 1
and 1
poor 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
start 1
right 1
off 1
and 1
work 1
his 1
way 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
Indian 1
Ocean 1
and 1
put 1
in 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
trying 1
to 1
turn 1
the 1
pirates 1
into 1
the 1
true 1
path 1
for 1
he 1
could 1
do 1
it 1
better 1
than 1
anybody 1
else 1
being 1
acquainted 1
with 1
all 1
pirate 1
crews 1
in 1
that 1
ocean 1
and 1
though 1
it 1
would 1
take 1
him 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
to 1
get 1
there 1
without 1
money 1
he 1
would 1
get 1
there 1
anyway 1
and 1
every 1
time 1
he 1
convinced 1
a 1
pirate 1
he 1
would 1
say 1
to 1
him 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
thank 1
me 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
give 1
me 1
no 1
credit 1
it 1
all 1
belongs 1
to 1
them 1
dear 1
people 1
in 1
Pokeville 1
camp 1
meeting 1
natural 1
brothers 1
and 1
benefactors 1
of 1
the 1
race 1
and 1
that 1
dear 1
preacher 1
there 1
the 1
truest 1
friend 1
a 1
pirate 1
ever 1
had 1
And 1
then 1
he 1
busted 1
into 1
tears 1
and 1
so 1
did 1
everybody 1
Then 1
somebody 1
sings 1
out 1
Take 1
up 1
a 1
collection 1
for 1
him 1
take 1
up 1
a 1
collection 1
Well 1
a 1
half 1
a 1
dozen 1
made 1
a 1
jump 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
but 1
somebody 1
sings 1
out 1
Let 1
him 1
pass 1
the 1
hat 1
around 1
Then 1
everybody 1
said 1
it 1
the 1
preacher 1
too 1
So 1
the 1
king 1
went 1
all 1
through 1
the 1
crowd 1
with 1
his 1
hat 1
swabbing 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
blessing 1
the 1
people 1
and 1
praising 1
them 1
and 1
thanking 1
them 1
for 1
being 1
so 1
good 1
to 1
the 1
poor 1
pirates 1
away 1
off 1
there 1
and 1
every 1
little 1
while 1
the 1
prettiest 1
kind 1
of 1
girls 1
with 1
the 1
tears 1
running 1
down 1
their 1
cheeks 1
would 1
up 1
and 1
ask 1
him 1
would 1
he 1
let 1
them 1
kiss 1
him 1
for 1
to 1
remember 1
him 1
by 1
and 1
he 1
always 1
done 1
it 1
and 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
he 1
hugged 1
and 1
kissed 1
as 1
many 1
as 1
five 1
or 1
six 1
times 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
invited 1
to 1
stay 1
a 1
week 1
and 1
everybody 1
wanted 1
him 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
their 1
houses 1
and 1
said 1
they 1
d 1
think 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
honor 1
but 1
he 1
said 1
as 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
last 1
day 1
of 1
the 1
camp 1
meeting 1
he 1
couldn 1
t 1
do 1
no 1
good 1
and 1
besides 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
sweat 1
to 1
get 1
to 1
the 1
Indian 1
Ocean 1
right 1
off 1
and 1
go 1
to 1
work 1
on 1
the 1
pirates 1
When 1
we 1
got 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
raft 1
and 1
he 1
come 1
to 1
count 1
up 1
he 1
found 1
he 1
had 1
collected 1
eighty 1
seven 1
dollars 1
and 1
seventy 1
five 1
cents 1
And 1
then 1
he 1
had 1
fetched 1
away 1
a 1
three 1
gallon 1
jug 1
of 1
whisky 1
too 1
that 1
he 1
found 1
under 1
a 1
wagon 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
starting 1
home 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
The 1
king 1
said 1
take 1
it 1
all 1
around 1
it 1
laid 1
over 1
any 1
day 1
he 1
d 1
ever 1
put 1
in 2
the 1
missionarying 1
line 1
He 1
said 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
use 1
talking 1
heathens 1
don 1
t 1
amount 1
to 1
shucks 1
alongside 1
of 1
pirates 1
to 1
work 1
a 1
camp 1
meeting 1
with 1
The 1
duke 1
was 1
thinking 1
he 1
d 1
been 1
doing 1
pretty 1
well 1
till 1
the 1
king 1
come 1
to 1
show 1
up 1
but 1
after 1
that 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
think 1
so 2
much 1
He 1
had 1
set 1
up 1
and 1
printed 1
off 1
two 1
little 1
jobs 1
for 1
farmers 1
in 1
that 1
printing 1
office 1
horse 1
bills 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
money 1
four 1
dollars 1
And 1
he 1
had 1
got 1
in 1
ten 1
dollars 1
worth 1
of 1
advertisements 1
for 1
the 1
paper 1
which 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
put 1
in 1
for 1
four 1
dollars 1
if 1
they 1
would 1
pay 1
in 1
advance 1
so 1
they 1
done 1
it 1
The 1
price 1
of 1
the 1
paper 1
was 1
two 1
dollars 1
a 1
year 1
but 1
he 1
took 1
in 1
three 1
subscriptions 1
for 1
half 1
a 1
dollar 1
apiece 1
on 1
condition 1
of 1
them 1
paying 1
him 1
in 1
advance 1
they 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
pay 1
in 1
cordwood 1
and 1
onions 1
as 1
usual 1
but 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
had 1
just 1
bought 1
the 1
concern 1
and 1
knocked 1
down 1
the 1
price 1
as 1
low 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
afford 1
it 1
and 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
run 1
it 1
for 1
cash 1
He 1
set 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
piece 1
of 1
poetry 1
which 1
he 1
made 1
himself 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
head 1
three 1
verses 1
kind 1
of 1
sweet 1
and 1
saddish 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
it 1
was 1
Yes 1
crush 1
cold 1
world 1
this 1
breaking 1
heart 1
and 1
he 1
left 1
that 1
all 1
set 1
up 1
and 1
ready 1
to 1
print 1
in 1
the 1
paper 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
charge 1
nothing 1
for 1
it 1
Well 1
he 1
took 1
in 1
nine 1
dollars 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
d 1
done 1
a 1
pretty 1
square 1
day 1
s 1
work 1
for 1
it 1
Then 1
he 1
showed 1
us 1
another 1
little 1
job 1
he 1
d 1
printed 1
and 1
hadn 1
t 1
charged 1
for 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
for 1
us 1
It 1
had 1
a 1
picture 1
of 1
a 1
runaway 1
nigger 1
with 1
a 1
bundle 1
on 1
a 1
stick 1
over 1
his 1
shoulder 1
and 1
reward 1
under 1
it 1
The 1
reading 1
was 1
all 1
about 1
Jim 1
and 1
just 1
described 1
him 1
to 1
a 1
dot 1
It 1
said 1
he 1
run 1
away 1
from 1
St 1
Jacques 1
plantation 1
forty 1
mile 1
below 1
New 1
Orleans 1
last 1
winter 1
and 1
likely 1
went 1
north 1
and 1
whoever 1
would 1
catch 1
him 1
and 1
send 1
him 1
back 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
the 1
reward 1
and 1
expenses 1
Now 1
says 1
the 1
duke 1
after 1
to 1
night 1
we 1
can 1
run 1
in 1
the 1
daytime 1
if 1
we 1
want 1
to 1
Whenever 1
we 1
see 1
anybody 1
coming 1
we 1
can 1
tie 1
Jim 1
hand 1
and 1
foot 1
with 1
a 1
rope 1
and 1
lay 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
wigwam 1
and 1
show 1
this 1
handbill 1
and 1
say 1
we 1
captured 1
him 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
were 1
too 1
poor 1
to 1
travel 1
on 1
a 1
steamboat 1
so 1
we 1
got 1
this 1
little 1
raft 1
on 1
credit 1
from 1
our 1
friends 1
and 1
are 1
going 1
down 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
reward 1
Handcuffs 1
and 1
chains 1
would 1
look 1
still 1
better 1
on 1
Jim 1
but 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
go 1
well 1
with 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
us 1
being 1
so 1
poor 1
Too 1
much 1
like 1
jewelry 1
Ropes 1
are 1
the 1
correct 1
thing 1
we 1
must 1
preserve 1
the 1
unities 1
as 1
we 1
say 1
on 1
the 1
boards 1
We 1
all 1
said 1
the 1
duke 1
was 1
pretty 1
smart 1
and 1
there 1
couldn 1
t 1
be 1
no 1
trouble 1
about 1
running 1
daytimes 1
We 1
judged 1
we 1
could 1
make 1
miles 1
enough 1
that 1
night 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
reach 1
of 1
the 1
powwow 1
we 1
reckoned 1
the 1
duke 1
s 1
work 1
in 1
the 1
printing 1
office 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
make 1
in 1
that 1
little 1
town 1
then 1
we 1
could 1
boom 1
right 1
along 1
if 1
we 1
wanted 1
to 1
We 1
laid 1
low 1
and 1
kept 1
still 1
and 1
never 1
shoved 1
out 1
till 1
nearly 1
ten 1
o 1
clock 1
then 1
we 1
slid 1
by 1
pretty 1
wide 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
hoist 1
our 1
lantern 1
till 1
we 1
was 1
clear 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
of 1
it 1
When 1
Jim 1
called 1
me 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
watch 1
at 1
four 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
he 1
says 1

I 1
found 1
Jim 1
had 1
been 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
him 1
to 1
talk 1
French 1
so 1
he 1
could 1
hear 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
like 1
but 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
this 1
country 1
so 1
long 1
and 1
had 1
so 1
much 1
trouble 1
he 1
d 1

CHAPTER 1
XXI 1
IT 1
was 1
after 1
sun 1
up 1
now 1
but 1
we 1
went 1
right 1
on 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
tie 1
up 1
The 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
turned 1
out 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
looking 1
pretty 1
rusty 1
but 1
after 1
they 1
d 1
jumped 1
overboard 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
swim 1
it 1
chippered 1
them 1
up 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
After 1
breakfast 1
the 1
king 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
seat 1
on 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
raft 1
and 1
pulled 1
off 1
his 1
boots 1
and 1
rolled 1
up 1
his 1
britches 1
and 1
let 1
his 1
legs 1
dangle 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
be 1
comfortable 1
and 1
lit 1
his 1
pipe 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
getting 1
his 1
Romeo 1
and 1
Juliet 1
by 1
heart 1
When 1
he 1
had 1
got 1
it 1
pretty 1
good 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
begun 1
to 1
practice 1
it 1
together 1
The 1
duke 1
had 1
to 1
learn 1
him 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
again 1
how 1
to 1
say 1
every 1
speech 1
and 1
he 1
made 1
him 1
sigh 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
on 1
his 1
heart 1
and 1
after 1
a 1
while 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
done 1
it 1
pretty 1
well 1
only 1
he 1
says 1
you 1
mustn 1
t 1
bellow 1
out 1
Romeo 1
that 1
way 1
like 1
a 1
bull 1
you 1
must 1
say 1
it 1
soft 1
and 1
sick 1
and 1
languishy 1
so 1
R 1
o 2
meo 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
idea 1
for 1
Juliet 1
s 1
a 1
dear 1
sweet 1
mere 1
child 1
of 1
a 1
girl 1
you 1
know 1
and 1
she 1
doesn 1
t 1
bray 1
like 1
a 1
jackass 1
Well 1
next 1
they 1
got 1
out 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
long 1
swords 1
that 1
the 1
duke 1
made 1
out 1
of 1
oak 1
laths 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
practice 1
the 1
sword 1
fight 1
the 1
duke 1
called 1
himself 1
Richard 1
III 1
and 1
the 1
way 1
they 1
laid 1
on 1
and 1
pranced 1
around 1
the 1
raft 1
was 1
grand 1
to 1
see 1
But 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
king 1
tripped 1
and 1
fell 1
overboard 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
they 1
took 1
a 1
rest 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
talk 1
about 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
adventures 1
they 1
d 1
had 1
in 1
other 1
times 1
along 1
the 1
river 1
After 1
dinner 1
the 1
duke 1
says 1
Well 1
Capet 1
we 1
ll 1
want 1
to 1
make 1
this 1
a 1
first 1
class 1
show 1
you 1
know 1
so 1
I 1
guess 1
we 1
ll 1
add 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
to 1
it 1
We 1
want 1
a 1
little 1
something 1
to 1
answer 1
encores 1
with 1
anyway 1
What 1
s 1
onkores 1
Bilgewater 1
The 1
duke 1
told 1
him 1
and 1
then 1
says 1
I 1
ll 1
answer 1
by 1
doing 1
the 1
Highland 1
fling 1
or 1
the 1
sailor 1
s 1
hornpipe 1
and 1
you 1
well 1
let 1
me 1
see 1
oh 1
I 1
ve 1
got 1
it 1
you 1
can 1
do 1
Hamlet 1
s 1
soliloquy 1
Hamlet 1
s 1
which 1
Hamlet 1
s 1
soliloquy 1
you 1
know 1
the 1
most 1
celebrated 1
thing 1
in 1
Shakespeare 1
Ah 1
it 1
s 1
sublime 2
Always 1
fetches 1
the 1
house 1
I 1
haven 1
t 1
got 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
book 1
I 1
ve 1
only 1
got 1
one 1
volume 1
but 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
can 1
piece 1
it 1
out 1
from 1
memory 1
I 1
ll 1
just 1
walk 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
a 1
minute 1
and 1
see 1
if 1
I 1
can 1
call 1
it 1
back 1
from 1
recollection 1
s 1
vaults 1
So 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
marching 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
thinking 1
and 1
frowning 1
horrible 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 2
he 1
would 1
hoist 1
up 1
his 1
eyebrows 1
next 1
he 1
would 1
squeeze 1
his 1
hand 1
on 1
his 1
forehead 1
and 1
stagger 1
back 1
and 1
kind 1
of 1
moan 1
next 1
he 1
would 1
sigh 1
and 1
next 1
he 1
d 1
let 1
on 1
to 1
drop 1
a 1
tear 1
It 1
was 1
beautiful 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
he 1
got 1
it 1
He 1
told 1
us 1
to 1
give 1
attention 1
Then 1
he 1
strikes 1
a 1
most 1
noble 1
attitude 1
with 1
one 1
leg 1
shoved 1
forwards 1
and 1
his 1
arms 1
stretched 1
away 1
up 1
and 1
his 1
head 1
tilted 1
back 1
looking 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
sky 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
begins 1
to 1
rip 1
and 1
rave 1
and 1
grit 1
his 1
teeth 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
all 1
through 1
his 1
speech 1
he 1
howled 1
and 1
spread 1
around 1
and 1
swelled 1
up 1
his 1
chest 1
and 1
just 1
knocked 1
the 1
spots 1
out 1
of 1
any 1
acting 1
ever 1
I 1
see 1
before 1
This 1
is 1
the 1
speech 1
I 1
learned 1
it 1
easy 1
enough 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
learning 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
To 1
be 1
or 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
bare 1
bodkin 1
That 1
makes 1
calamity 1
of 1
so 1
long 1
life 1
For 1
who 1
would 1
fardels 1
bear 1
till 1
Birnam 1
Wood 1
do 1
come 1
to 1
Dunsinane 1
But 1
that 1
the 1
fear 1
of 1
something 1
after 1
death 1
Murders 1
the 1
innocent 1
sleep 1
Great 1
nature 1
s 1
second 1
course 1
And 1
makes 1
us 1
rather 1
sling 1
the 1
arrows 1
of 1
outrageous 1
fortune 1
Than 1
fly 1
to 1
others 1
that 1
we 1
know 1
not 1
of 1
There 1
s 1
the 1
respect 1
must 1
give 1
us 1
pause 1
Wake 1
Duncan 1
with 1
thy 1
knocking 1
I 1
would 1
thou 1
couldst 1
For 1
who 1
would 1
bear 1
the 1
whips 1
and 1
scorns 1
of 1
time 1
The 1
oppressor 1
s 1
wrong 1
the 1
proud 1
man 1
s 1
contumely 1
The 1
law 1
s 1
delay 1
and 1
the 1
quietus 1
which 1
his 1
pangs 1
might 1
take 1
In 1
the 1
dead 1
waste 1
and 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
when 1
churchyards 1
yawn 1
In 1
customary 1
suits 1
of 1
solemn 1
black 1
But 1
that 1
the 1
undiscovered 1
country 1
from 1
whose 1
bourne 1
no 1
traveler 1
returns 1
Breathes 1
forth 1
contagion 1
on 1
the 1
world 1
And 1
thus 1
the 1
native 1
hue 1
of 1
resolution 1
like 1
the 1
poor 1
cat 1
i 1
the 1
adage 1
Is 1
sicklied 1
o 1
er 1
with 1
care 1
And 1
all 1
the 1
clouds 1
that 1
lowered 1
o 1
er 1
our 1
housetops 1
With 1
this 1
regard 1
their 1
currents 1
turn 1
awry 1
And 1
lose 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
action 1
Tis 1
a 1
consummation 1
devoutly 1
to 1
be 1
wished 1
But 1
soft 1
you 1
the 1
fair 1
Ophelia 1
Ope 1
not 1
thy 1
ponderous 1
and 1
marble 1
jaws 1
But 1
get 1
thee 1
to 1
a 1
nunnery 1
mdash 1
go 1
Well 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
he 1
liked 1
that 1
speech 1
and 1
he 1
mighty 1
soon 1
got 1
it 1
so 1
he 1
could 1
do 1
it 1
first 1
rate 1
It 1
seemed 1
like 1
he 1
was 1
just 1
born 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
his 1
hand 1
in 1
and 1
was 1
excited 1
it 1
was 1
perfectly 1
lovely 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
would 1
rip 1
and 1
tear 1
and 1
rair 1
up 1
behind 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
getting 1
it 1
off 1
The 1
first 1
chance 1
we 1
got 1
the 1
duke 1
he 1
had 1
some 1
show 1
bills 1
printed 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
for 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
days 1
as 1
we 1
floated 1
along 1
the 1
raft 1
was 1
a 1
most 1
uncommon 1
lively 1
place 1
for 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
nothing 1
but 1
sword 1
fighting 1
and 1
rehearsing 1
as 1
the 1
duke 1
called 1
it 1
going 1
on 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
One 1
morning 1
when 1
we 1
was 1
pretty 1
well 1
down 1
the 1
State 1
of 1
Arkansaw 1
we 1
come 1
in 1
sight 1
of 1
a 1
little 1
one 1
horse 1
town 1
in 1
a 1
big 1
bend 1
so 1
we 1
tied 1
up 1
about 1
three 1
quarters 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
above 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
a 1
crick 1
which 1
was 1
shut 1
in 1
like 1
a 1
tunnel 1
by 1
the 1
cypress 1
trees 1
and 1
all 1
of 1
us 1
but 1
Jim 1
took 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
went 1
down 1
there 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
any 1
chance 1
in 1
that 1
place 1
for 1
our 1
show 1
We 1
struck 1
it 1
mighty 1
lucky 1
there 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
circus 1
there 1
that 1
afternoon 1
and 1
the 1
country 1
people 1
was 1
already 1
beginning 1
to 1
come 1
in 2
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
old 1
shackly 1
wagons 1
and 1
on 1
horses 1
The 1
circus 1
would 1
leave 1
before 1
night 1
so 1
our 1
show 1
would 1
have 1
a 1
pretty 1
good 1
chance 1
The 1
duke 1
he 1
hired 1
the 1
court 1
house 1
and 1
we 1
went 1
around 1
and 1
stuck 1
up 1
our 1
bills 1
They 1
read 1
like 1
this 1

Then 1
we 1
went 1
loafing 1
around 1
the 1
town 1
The 1
stores 1
and 1
houses 1
was 1
most 1
all 1
old 1
shackly 1
dried 1
up 1
frame 1
concerns 1
that 1
hadn 1
t 1
ever 1
been 1
painted 1
they 1
was 1
set 1
up 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
foot 1
above 1
ground 1
on 1
stilts 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
be 1
out 1
of 1
reach 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
when 1
the 1
river 1
was 1
overflowed 1
The 1
houses 1
had 1
little 1
gardens 1
around 1
them 1
but 1
they 1
didn 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
raise 1
hardly 1
anything 1
in 1
them 1
but 1
jimpson 1
weeds 1
and 1
sunflowers 1
and 1
ash 1
piles 1
and 1
old 1
curled 1
up 1
boots 1
and 1
shoes 1
and 1
pieces 1
of 1
bottles 1
and 1
rags 1
and 1
played 1
out 1
tin 1
ware 1
The 1
fences 1
was 1
made 1
of 1
different 1
kinds 1
of 1
boards 1
nailed 1
on 1
at 1
different 1
times 1
and 1
they 1
leaned 1
every 1
which 1
way 1
and 1
had 1
gates 1
that 1
didn 1
t 1
generly 1
have 1
but 1
one 1
hinge 1
a 1
leather 1
one 1
Some 1
of 1
the 1
fences 1
had 1
been 1
whitewashed 1
some 1
time 1
or 1
another 1
but 1
the 1
duke 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
Clumbus 1
s 1
time 1
like 1

There 1
was 1
generly 1

the 1
garden 1
and 1

All 1

one 1
street 1
They 1
had 1
white 1
domestic 1
awnings 1
in 1
front 1
and 1
the 1
country 1
people 1
hitched 1
their 1
horses 1
to 1
the 1
awning 1
posts 1
There 1
was 1
empty 1
drygoods 1
boxes 1
under 1
the 1
awnings 1
and 1
loafers 1
roosting 1
on 1
them 1
all 1
day 1

with 1
their 1
Barlow 1

mighty 1
ornery 1

generly 1

on 1
yellow 1
straw 1
hats 1

considerable 1
many 1
cuss 1
words 1
There 1
was 1
as 1
many 1
as 1
one 1
loafer 1
leaning 1
up 1
against 1
every 1
awning 1
post 1
and 1
he 1
most 1
always 1
had 1
his 1
hands 1
in 1
his 1
britches 1
pockets 1
except 1

deep 1
in 1
some 1
places 1
and 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
inches 1
deep 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
places 1
The 1
hogs 1

and 1
grunted 1
around 1
everywheres 1
You 1

see 1
a 1
muddy 1
sow 1
and 1
a 1
litter 1
of 1
pigs 1
come 1
lazying 1
along 1
the 1
street 1
and 1
whollop 1
herself 1
right 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
where 1
folks 1
had 1
to 1
walk 1
around 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
d 1
stretch 1
out 1
and 1
shut 1
her 1
eyes 1
and 1
wave 1
her 1
ears 1
whilst 1
the 1
pigs 1
was 1
milking 1
her 1
and 1
look 1
as 1
happy 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
was 1
on 1
salary 1
And 1
pretty 1
soon 1
you 1
d 1
hear 1
a 1
loafer 1
sing 1
out 1
Hi 1
so 1
boy 1
sick 1
him 1
Tige 1
and 1
away 1
the 1
sow 1
would 1
go 1
squealing 1
most 1
horrible 1
with 1
a 1
dog 1
or 1
two 1
swinging 1
to 1
each 1
ear 1
and 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
dozen 1
more 1
a 1
coming 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
would 1
see 1
all 1
the 1
loafers 1
get 1
up 1
and 1
watch 1
the 1
thing 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
and 1
laugh 1
at 1
the 1
fun 1
and 1
look 1
grateful 1
for 1
the 1
noise 1
Then 1
they 1
d 1
settle 1
back 1
again 1
till 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
dog 1
fight 1
There 1
couldn 1
t 1
anything 1
wake 1
them 1
up 1
all 1
over 1
and 1
make 1
them 1
happy 1
all 1
over 1
like 1
a 1
dog 1
fight 1
unless 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
putting 1
turpentine 1
on 1
a 1
stray 1
dog 1
and 1
setting 1
fire 1
to 1
him 1
or 1
tying 1
a 1
tin 1
pan 1
to 1
his 1
tail 1
and 1
see 1
him 1
run 1
himself 1
to 1
death 1
On 1
the 1
river 1
front 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
houses 1
was 1
sticking 1
out 1
over 1
the 1
bank 1
and 1
they 1
was 1
bowed 1
and 1
bent 1
and 1
about 1
ready 1
to 1
tumble 1
in 1
The 1
people 1
had 1
moved 1
out 1
of 1
them 1
The 1
bank 1
was 1
caved 1
away 1
under 1
one 1
corner 1
of 1
some 1
others 1
and 1
that 1
corner 1
was 1
hanging 1
over 1
People 1
lived 1
in 1
them 1
yet 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
dangersome 1
because 1
sometimes 1
a 1
strip 1
of 1
land 1
as 1
wide 1
as 1
a 1
house 1
caves 1
in 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
Sometimes 1
a 1
belt 1
of 1
land 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
deep 1
will 1
start 1
in 1
and 1
cave 1
along 1
and 1
cave 1
along 1
till 1
it 1
all 1
caves 1
into 1
the 1
river 1
in 1
one 1
summer 1
Such 1
a 1
town 1
as 1
that 1
has 1
to 1
be 1
always 1
moving 1
back 1
and 1
back 1
and 1
back 1
because 1
the 1
river 1
s 1
always 1
gnawing 1
at 1
it 1
The 1
nearer 1
it 1
got 1
to 1
noon 1
that 1
day 1
the 1
thicker 1
and 1
thicker 1
was 1
the 1
wagons 1
and 1
horses 1
in 1
the 1
streets 1
and 1
more 1
coming 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
Families 1
fetched 1
their 1
dinners 1
with 1
them 1
from 1
the 1
country 1

All 1

Everybody 1

crowd 1
looked 1
mighty 1
sober 1
nobody 1
stirred 1
and 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
more 1
laughing 1
Boggs 1
rode 1
off 1
blackguarding 1
Sherburn 1
as 1
loud 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
yell 1
all 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
and 1
pretty 1
soon 1
back 1
he 1
comes 1
and 1
stops 1
before 1
the 1
store 1
still 1
keeping 1
it 1
up 1
Some 1
men 1
crowded 1
around 1
him 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
get 1
him 1
to 1
shut 1
up 1
but 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
they 1
told 1
him 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
one 1
o 1
clock 1
in 1
about 1
fifteen 1
minutes 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
must 1
go 1
home 1
he 1
must 1
go 1
right 1
away 1
But 1
it 1
didn 1
t 1
do 1
no 1
good 1
He 1
cussed 1
away 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
might 1
and 1
throwed 1
his 1
hat 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
mud 1
and 1
rode 1
over 1
it 1
and 1
pretty 1
soon 1
away 1
he 1
went 1
a 1
raging 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
again 1
with 1
his 1
gray 1
hair 1
a 1
flying 1
Everybody 1
that 1
could 1
get 1
a 1
chance 1
at 1
him 1
tried 1
their 1
best 1
to 1
coax 1
him 1
off 1
of 1
his 1
horse 1
so 1
they 1
could 1
lock 1
him 1
up 1
and 1
get 1
him 1
sober 1
but 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
use 1
up 1
the 1
street 1
he 1
would 1
tear 1
again 1
and 1
give 1
Sherburn 1
another 1
cussing 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
somebody 1
says 1
Go 1
for 1
his 1
daughter 1
quick 1
go 1
for 1
his 1
daughter 1
sometimes 1
he 1
ll 1
listen 1
to 1
her 1
If 1
anybody 1
can 1
persuade 1
him 1
she 1
can 1
So 1
somebody 1
started 1
on 1
a 1
run 1
I 1
walked 1
down 1
street 1
a 1
ways 1
and 1
stopped 1
In 1
about 1
five 1
or 1
ten 1
minutes 1
here 1
comes 1
Boggs 1
again 1
but 1
not 1
on 1
his 1
horse 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
reeling 1
across 1
the 1
street 1
towards 1
me 1
bare 1
headed 1
with 1
a 1
friend 1
on 1
both 1
sides 1
of 1
him 1
a 1
holt 1
of 1
his 1
arms 1
and 1
hurrying 1
him 1
along 1
He 1
was 1
quiet 1
and 1
looked 1
uneasy 1
and 1
he 1
warn 1
t 1
hanging 1
back 1
any 1
but 1
was 1
doing 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
hurrying 1
himself 1
Somebody 1
sings 1
out 1
Boggs 1
I 1
looked 1
over 1
there 1
to 1
see 1
who 1
said 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
Colonel 1
Sherburn 1
He 1
was 1
standing 1
perfectly 1
still 1
in 1
the 1
street 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
pistol 1
raised 1
in 1
his 1
right 1
hand 1
not 1
aiming 1
it 1
but 1
holding 1
it 1
out 1
with 1
the 1
barrel 1
tilted 1
up 1
towards 1
the 1
sky 1
The 1
same 1
second 1
I 1
see 1
a 1
young 1
girl 1
coming 1
on 1
the 1
run 1
and 1
two 1
men 1
with 1
her 1
Boggs 1
and 1
the 1
men 1
turned 1
round 1
to 1
see 1
who 1
called 1
him 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
see 1
the 1
pistol 1
the 1
men 1
jumped 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
the 1
pistol 1
barrel 1
come 1
down 1
slow 1
and 1
steady 1
to 1
a 1
level 1
both 1
barrels 1
cocked 1
Boggs 1
throws 1
up 1
both 1
of 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
says 1
O 1
Lord 1
don 1
t 1
shoot 1
Bang 1
goes 1
the 1
first 1
shot 1
and 1
he 1
staggers 1
back 1
clawing 1
at 1
the 1
air 1
bang 1
goes 1
the 1
second 1
one 1
and 1
he 1
tumbles 1
backwards 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
heavy 1
and 1
solid 1
with 1
his 1
arms 1
spread 1
out 1
That 1
young 1
girl 1
screamed 1
out 1
and 1
comes 1
rushing 1
and 1
down 1
she 1
throws 1
herself 1
on 1
her 1
father 1
crying 1
and 1
saying 1
Oh 1
he 1
s 1
killed 1
him 1
he 1
s 1
killed 1
him 1
The 1
crowd 1
closed 1
up 1
around 1
them 1
and 1
shouldered 1
and 1
jammed 1
one 1
another 1
with 1
their 1
necks 1
stretched 1
trying 1
to 1
see 1
and 1
people 1
on 1
the 1
inside 1
trying 1
to 1
shove 1
them 1
back 1
and 1
shouting 1
Back 1
back 1
give 1
him 1
air 1
give 1
him 1
air 1
Colonel 1
Sherburn 1
he 1
tossed 1
his 1
pistol 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
turned 1
around 1
on 1
his 1
heels 1
and 1
walked 1
off 1
They 1
took 1
Boggs 1
to 1
a 1
little 1
drug 1
store 1
the 1
crowd 1
pressing 1
around 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
town 1
following 1
and 1
I 1
rushed 1
and 1
got 1
a 1
good 1
place 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
where 1
I 1
was 1
close 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
could 1
see 1
in 1
They 1
laid 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
put 1
one 1
large 1
Bible 1
under 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
opened 1
another 1
one 1
and 1
spread 1
it 1
on 1
his 1
breast 1
but 1
they 1
tore 1
open 1
his 1
shirt 1
first 1
and 1
I 1
seen 1
where 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
bullets 1
went 1
in 1
He 1
made 1
about 1
a 1
dozen 1
long 1
gasps 1
his 1
breast 1
lifting 1
the 1
Bible 1
up 1
when 1
he 1
drawed 1
in 1
his 1
breath 1
and 1
letting 1
it 1
down 1
again 1
when 1
he 1
breathed 1
it 1
out 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
he 1
laid 1
still 1
he 1
was 1
dead 1
Then 1
they 1
pulled 1
his 1
daughter 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
screaming 1
and 1
crying 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
off 1
She 1
was 1
about 1
sixteen 1
and 1
very 1
sweet 1
and 1
gentle 1
looking 1
but 1
awful 1
pale 1
and 1
scared 1
Well 1
pretty 1
soon 1
the 1
whole 1
town 1
was 1
there 1
squirming 1
and 1
scrouging 1
and 1
pushing 1
and 1
shoving 1
to 1
get 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
have 1
a 1
look 1
but 1
people 1
that 1
had 1
the 1
places 1
wouldn 1
t 1
give 1
them 1
up 1
and 1
folks 1
behind 1
them 1

saying 1
all 1

time 1
Say 1

as 1

There 1
was 1
considerable 1
jawing 1
back 1
so 1
I 1
slid 1
out 1
thinking 1
maybe 1
there 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
trouble 1
The 1
streets 1
was 1
full 1
and 1
everybody 1
was 1
excited 1
Everybody 1
that 1
seen 1
the 1
shooting 1
was 1
telling 1
how 1
it 1
happened 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
big 1
crowd 1
packed 1
around 1
each 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
fellows 1
stretching 1
their 1
necks 1
and 1
listening 1
One 1
long 1
lanky 1
man 1
with 1
long 1
hair 1
and 1
a 1
big 1
white 1
fur 1
stovepipe 1
hat 1
on 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
a 1
crooked 1
handled 1
cane 1
marked 1
out 1
the 1
places 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
where 1
Boggs 1
stood 1
and 1
where 1
Sherburn 1
stood 1
and 1
the 1
people 1
following 1
him 1
around 1
from 1
one 1
place 1
to 1
t 1
other 1
and 1
watching 1
everything 1
he 1
done 1
and 1
bobbing 1
their 1
heads 1
to 1
show 1
they 1
understood 1
and 1
stooping 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
resting 1
their 1
hands 1
on 1
their 1
thighs 1
to 1
watch 1
him 1
mark 1
the 1
places 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
with 1
his 1
cane 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
stood 1
up 1
straight 1
and 1
stiff 1
where 1
Sherburn 1
had 1
stood 1
frowning 1
and 1
having 1
his 1
hat 1
brim 1
down 1
over 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
sung 1
out 1
Boggs 1
and 1
then 1
fetched 1
his 1
cane 1
down 1
slow 1
to 1
a 1
level 1
and 1
says 1
Bang 1
staggered 1
backwards 1
says 1
Bang 1
again 1
and 1
fell 1
down 1
flat 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
The 1
people 1
that 1
had 1
seen 1
the 1
thing 1
said 1
he 1
done 1
it 1
perfect 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
exactly 1
the 1
way 1
it 1
all 1
happened 1
Then 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
a 1
dozen 1
people 1
got 1
out 1
their 1
bottles 1
and 1
treated 1
him 1
Well 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
somebody 1
said 1
Sherburn 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
lynched 1
In 1
about 1
a 1
minute 1
everybody 1
was 1
saying 1
it 1
so 1
away 1
they 1
went 1
mad 1
and 1
yelling 1
and 1
snatching 1
down 1
every 1
clothes 1
line 1
they 1
come 1
to 2
do 1
the 1
hanging 1
with 1
CHAPTER 1
XXII 1
THEY 1
swarmed 1
up 1
towards 1
Sherburn 1
s 1
house 1
a 1
whooping 1
and 1
raging 1
like 1
Injuns 1
and 1
everything 1
had 1
to 1
clear 1
the 1
way 1
or 1
get 1
run 1
over 1
and 1
tromped 1
to 1
mush 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
awful 1
to 1
see 1
Children 1
was 1
heeling 1
it 1
ahead 1
of 1
the 1
mob 1
screaming 1
and 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
and 1
every 1
window 1
along 1
the 1
road 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
women 1
s 1
heads 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
nigger 1
boys 1
in 1
every 1
tree 1
and 1
bucks 1
and 1
wenches 1
looking 1
over 1
every 1
fence 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
mob 1
would 1
get 1
nearly 1
to 1
them 1
they 1
would 1
break 1
and 1
skaddle 1
back 1
out 1
of 1
reach 1
Lots 1
of 1
the 1
women 1
and 1
girls 1
was 1
crying 1
and 1
taking 1
on 1
scared 1
most 1
to 1
death 1
They 1
swarmed 1
up 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
Sherburn 1
s 1
palings 1
as 1
thick 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
jam 1
together 1
and 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
hear 1
yourself 1
think 1
for 1
the 1
noise 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
twenty 1
foot 1
yard 1
Some 1
sung 1
out 1
Tear 1
down 1
the 1
fence 1
tear 1
down 1
the 1
fence 1
Then 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
racket 1
of 1
ripping 1
and 1
tearing 1
and 1
smashing 1
and 1
down 1
she 1
goes 1
and 1
the 1
front 1
wall 1
of 1
the 1
crowd 1
begins 1
to 1
roll 1
in 1
like 1
a 1
wave 1
Just 1
then 1
Sherburn 1
steps 1
out 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
roof 1
of 1
his 1
little 1
front 1
porch 1
with 1
a 1
double 1
barrel 1
gun 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
takes 1
his 1
stand 1
perfectly 1
ca 1
m 1
and 1
deliberate 1
not 1
saying 1
a 1
word 1
The 1
racket 1
stopped 1
and 1
the 1
wave 1
sucked 1
back 1
Sherburn 1
never 1
said 1
a 1
word 1
just 1
stood 1
there 1
looking 1
down 1
The 1
stillness 1
was 1
awful 1
creepy 1
and 1
uncomfortable 1
Sherburn 1
run 1
his 1
eye 1
slow 1
along 1
the 1
crowd 1
and 1
wherever 1
it 1
struck 1
the 1
people 1
tried 1
a 1
little 1
to 1
out 1
gaze 1
him 1
but 1
they 1
couldn 1
t 1
they 1
dropped 1
their 1
eyes 1
and 1
looked 1
sneaky 1
Then 1
pretty 1
soon 1
Sherburn 1
sort 1
of 1
laughed 1
not 1
the 1
pleasant 1
kind 1
but 1
the 1
kind 1
that 1
makes 1
you 1
feel 1
like 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
eating 1
bread 1
that 1
s 1
got 1
sand 1
in 1
it 1
Then 1
he 1
says 1
slow 1
and 1
scornful 1
The 1
idea 1
of 1
you 1
lynching 1
anybody 1
It 1
s 1
amusing 1
The 1
idea 1
of 1
you 1
thinking 1
you 1
had 1
pluck 1
enough 1
to 1
lynch 1
a 1
man 1
Because 1
you 1
re 1
brave 1
enough 1
to 1
tar 1
and 1
feather 1
poor 1
friendless 1
cast 1
out 1
women 1
that 1
come 1
along 1
here 1
did 1
that 1
make 1
you 1
think 1
you 1
had 1
grit 1
enough 1
to 1
lay 1
your 1
hands 1
on 1
a 1
man 1
Why 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
safe 1
in 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
ten 1
thousand 1
of 1
your 1
kind 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
it 1
s 1
daytime 1
and 1
you 1
re 1
not 1
behind 1
him 1
Do 1
I 1
know 1
you 1
I 1
know 1
you 1
clear 1
through 1
I 1
was 1
born 1
and 1
raised 1
in 1
the 1
South 1
and 1
I 1
ve 1
lived 1
in 1
the 1
North 1
so 1
I 1
know 1
the 1
average 1
all 1
around 1
The 1
average 1
man 1
s 1
a 1
coward 1
In 1
the 1
North 1
he 1
lets 1
anybody 1
walk 1
over 1
him 1
that 1
wants 1
to 1
and 1
goes 1
home 1
and 1
prays 1
for 1
a 1
humble 1
spirit 1
to 1
bear 1
it 1
In 1
the 1
South 1
one 1
man 1
all 1
by 1
himself 1
has 1
stopped 1
a 1
stage 1
full 1
of 1
men 1
in 1
the 1
daytime 1
and 1
robbed 1
the 1
lot 1
Your 1
newspapers 1
call 1
you 1
a 1
brave 1
people 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
you 1
think 1
you 1
are 1
braver 1
than 1
any 1
other 1
people 1
whereas 1
you 1
re 1
just 1
as 1
brave 1
and 1
no 1
braver 1
Why 1
don 1
t 1
your 1
juries 1
hang 1
murderers 1
Because 1
they 1
re 1
afraid 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
friends 1
will 1
shoot 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
and 1
it 1
s 1
just 1
what 1
they 1
would 1
do 1
So 1
they 1
always 1
acquit 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
man 1
goes 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
with 1
a 1
hundred 1
masked 1
cowards 1
at 1
his 1
back 1
and 1
lynches 1
the 1
rascal 1
Your 1
mistake 1
is 1
that 1
you 1
didn 1
t 1
bring 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
you 1
that 1
s 1
one 1
mistake 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
is 1
that 1
you 1
didn 1
t 1
come 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
and 1
fetch 1
your 1
masks 1
You 1
brought 1
part 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
Buck 1
Harkness 1
there 1

if 1
you 1

d 1
a 1
taken 1

out 1
in 1
blowing 1
You 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
come 1
The 1
average 1
man 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
trouble 1
and 1
danger 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
trouble 1
and 1
danger 1
But 1
if 1
only 1
half 1
a 1
man 1
like 1
Buck 1
Harkness 1
there 1
shouts 1
Lynch 1
him 1
lynch 1
him 1
you 1
re 1
afraid 1
to 1
back 1
down 1
afraid 1
you 1
ll 1
be 1
found 1
out 1
to 1
be 1
what 1
you 1
are 1
cowards 1
and 1
so 1
you 1
raise 1
a 1
yell 1
and 1
hang 1
yourselves 1
on 1
to 1
that 1
half 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
coat 1
tail 1
and 1
come 1
raging 1
up 1
here 1
swearing 1
what 1
big 1
things 1
you 1
re 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
The 1
pitifulest 1
thing 1
out 1
is 1
a 1
mob 1
that 1
s 1
what 1
an 1
army 1
is 1
a 1
mob 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
fight 1
with 1
courage 1
that 1
s 1
born 1
in 1
them 1
but 1
with 1
courage 1
that 1
s 1
borrowed 1
from 1
their 1
mass 1
and 1
from 1
their 1
officers 1
But 1
a 1
mob 1
without 1
any 1
man 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
it 1
is 1
beneath 1
pitifulness 1
Now 1
the 1
thing 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
is 1
to 1
droop 1
your 1
tails 1
and 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
crawl 1
in 1
a 1
hole 1
If 1
any 1
real 1
lynching 1
s 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
done 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
Southern 1
fashion 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
come 1
they 1
ll 1
bring 1
their 1
masks 1
and 1
fetch 1
a 1
man 1
along 1
Now 1
leave 1
and 1
take 1
your 1
half 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
you 1
tossing 1
his 1
gun 1
up 1
across 1
his 1
left 1
arm 1
and 1
cocking 1
it 1
when 1
he 1
says 1
this 1
The 1
crowd 1
washed 1
back 1
sudden 1
and 1
then 1
broke 1
all 1
apart 1
and 1
went 1
tearing 1
off 1
every 1
which 1
way 1
and 1
Buck 1
Harkness 1
he 1
heeled 1
it 1
after 1
them 1
looking 1
tolerable 1
cheap 1
I 1
could 1
a 1
stayed 1
if 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
but 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
circus 1
and 1
loafed 1
around 1
the 1
back 1
side 1
till 1
the 1
watchman 1
went 1
by 1
and 1
then 1
dived 1
in 1
under 1
the 1
tent 1
I 1
had 1
my 1
twenty 1
dollar 1
gold 1
piece 1
and 1
some 1
other 1
money 1
but 1
I 1
reckoned 1
I 1
better 1
save 1
it 1
because 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
telling 1
how 1
soon 1
you 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
need 1
it 1
away 1
from 1
home 1
and 1
amongst 1
strangers 1
that 1
way 1
You 1
can 1
t 1
be 1
too 1
careful 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
opposed 1
to 1
spending 1
money 1
on 1
circuses 1
when 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
other 1
way 1
but 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
use 1
in 1
wasting 1
it 1
on 1
them 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
real 1
bully 1
circus 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
splendidest 1
sight 1
that 1
ever 1
was 1
when 1
they 1
all 1
come 1
riding 1
in 1
two 1
and 1
two 1
a 1
gentleman 1
and 1
lady 1
side 1
by 1
side 1
the 1
men 1
just 1
in 1
their 1
drawers 1
and 1
undershirts 1
and 1
no 1
shoes 1
nor 1
stirrups 1
and 1
resting 1
their 1
hands 1
on 1
their 1
thighs 1
easy 1
and 1
comfortable 1
there 1
must 1
a 1
been 1
twenty 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
every 1
lady 1
with 1
a 1
lovely 1
complexion 1
and 1
perfectly 1
beautiful 1
and 1
looking 1
just 1
like 1
a 1
gang 1
of 1
real 1
sure 1
enough 1
queens 1
and 1
dressed 1
in 1
clothes 1
that 1
cost 1
millions 1
of 1
dollars 1
and 1
just 1
littered 1
with 1
diamonds 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
powerful 1
fine 1
sight 1
I 1
never 1
see 1
anything 1
so 1
lovely 1
And 1
then 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
they 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
stood 1
and 1
went 1
a 1
weaving 1
around 1
the 1
ring 1
so 1
gentle 1
and 1
wavy 1
and 1
graceful 1
the 1
men 1
looking 1
ever 1
so 1
tall 1
and 1
airy 1
and 1
straight 1
with 1
their 1
heads 1
bobbing 1
and 1
skimming 1
along 1
away 1
up 1
there 1
under 1
the 1
tent 1
roof 1
and 1
every 1
lady 1
s 1
rose 1
leafy 1
dress 1
flapping 1
soft 1
and 1
silky 1
around 1
her 1
hips 1
and 1
she 1
looking 1
like 1
the 1
most 1
loveliest 1
parasol 1
And 1
then 1
faster 1
and 1
faster 1
they 1
went 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
dancing 1
first 1
one 1
foot 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
other 1
the 1
horses 1
leaning 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
and 1
the 1
ringmaster 1
going 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
the 1
center 1
pole 1
cracking 1
his 1
whip 1
and 1
shouting 1
Hi 1
hi 1
and 1
the 1
clown 1
cracking 1
jokes 1
behind 1
him 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
all 1
hands 1
dropped 1
the 1
reins 1
and 1
every 1
lady 1
put 1
her 1
knuckles 1
on 1
her 1
hips 1
and 1
every 1
gentleman 1
folded 1
his 1
arms 1
and 1
then 1
how 1
the 1
horses 1
did 1
lean 1
over 1
and 1
hump 1
themselves 1
And 1
so 1
one 1
after 1
the 1
other 1
they 1
all 1
skipped 1
off 1
into 1
the 1
ring 1
and 1
made 1
the 1
sweetest 1
bow 1
I 1
ever 1
see 1
and 1
then 1
scampered 1
out 1
and 1
everybody 1
clapped 1
their 1
hands 1
and 1
went 1
just 1
about 1
wild 1
Well 1
all 1
through 1
the 1
circus 1
they 1
done 1
the 1
most 1
astonishing 1
things 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
clown 1
carried 1
on 1
so 1
it 1
most 1
killed 1
the 1
people 1
The 1
ringmaster 1
couldn 1
t 1
ever 1
say 1
a 1
word 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
back 1
at 1
him 1
quick 1
as 1
a 1
wink 1
with 1
the 1
funniest 1
things 1
a 1
body 1
ever 1
said 1
and 1
how 1
he 1
ever 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
so 1
many 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
so 1
sudden 1
and 1
so 1
pat 1
was 1
what 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
noway 1
understand 1
Why 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
a 1
thought 1
of 1
them 1
in 1
a 1
year 1
And 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
a 1
drunk 1
man 1
tried 1
to 1
get 1
into 1
the 1
ring 1
said 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
ride 1
said 1
he 1
could 1
ride 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
anybody 1
that 1
ever 1
was 1
They 1
argued 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
keep 1
him 1
out 1
but 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
listen 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
show 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
standstill 1
Then 1
the 1
people 1
begun 1
to 1
holler 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
make 1
fun 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
that 1
made 1
him 1
mad 1
and 1
he 1
begun 1
to 1
rip 1
and 1
tear 1
so 1
that 1
stirred 1
up 1
the 1
people 1
and 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
men 1
begun 1
to 1
pile 1
down 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
benches 1
and 1
swarm 1
towards 1
the 1
ring 1
saying 1
Knock 1
him 1
down 1
throw 1
him 1
out 1
and 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
women 1
begun 1
to 1
scream 1
So 1
then 1
the 1
ringmaster 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
little 1
speech 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
hoped 1
there 1
wouldn 1
t 1
be 1
no 1
disturbance 1
and 1
if 1
the 1
man 1
would 1
promise 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
make 1
no 1
more 1
trouble 1
he 1
would 1
let 1
him 1
ride 1
if 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
could 1
stay 1
on 1
the 1
horse 1
So 1
everybody 1
laughed 1
and 1
said 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
the 1
man 1
got 1
on 1
The 1
minute 1
he 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
horse 1
begun 1
to 1
rip 1
and 1
tear 1
and 1
jump 1
and 1
cavort 1
around 1
with 1
two 1
circus 1
men 1
hanging 1
on 1
to 1
his 1
bridle 1
trying 1
to 1
hold 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
drunk 1
man 1
hanging 1
on 1
to 1
his 1
neck 1
and 1
his 1
heels 1
flying 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
every 1
jump 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
crowd 1
of 1
people 1
standing 1
up 1
shouting 1
and 1
laughing 1
till 1
tears 1
rolled 1
down 1
And 1
at 1
last 1
sure 1
enough 1
all 1
the 1
circus 1
men 1
could 1
do 1
the 1
horse 1
broke 1
loose 1
and 1
away 1
he 1
went 1
like 1
the 1
very 1
nation 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
the 1
ring 1
with 1
that 1
sot 1
laying 1
down 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
hanging 1
to 1
his 1
neck 1
with 1
first 1
one 1
leg 1
hanging 1
most 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
then 1
t 1
other 1
one 1
on 1
t 1
other 1
side 1
and 1
the 1
people 1
just 1
crazy 1
It 1
warn 1
t 1
funny 1
to 1
me 1
though 1
I 1
was 1
all 1
of 1
a 1
tremble 1
to 1
see 1
his 1
danger 1
But 1
pretty 1
soon 1
he 1
struggled 1
up 1
astraddle 1
and 1
grabbed 1
the 1
bridle 1
a 1
reeling 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
that 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
minute 1
he 1
sprung 1
up 1
and 1
dropped 1
the 1
bridle 1
and 1
stood 1
and 1
the 1
horse 1
a 1
going 1
like 1
a 1
house 1
afire 1
too 1
He 1
just 1
stood 1
up 1
there 1
a 1
sailing 1
around 1
as 1
easy 1
and 1
comfortable 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
warn 1
t 1
ever 1
drunk 1
in 1
his 1
life 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
begun 1
to 1
pull 1
off 1
his 1
clothes 1
and 1
sling 1
them 1
He 1
shed 1
them 1
so 1
thick 1
they 1
kind 1
of 1
clogged 1
up 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
altogether 1
he 1
shed 1
seventeen 1
suits 1
And 1
then 1
there 1
he 1
was 1
slim 1
and 1
handsome 1
and 1
dressed 1
the 1
gaudiest 1
and 1
prettiest 1
you 1
ever 1
saw 1
and 1
he 1
lit 1
into 1
that 1
horse 1
with 1
his 1
whip 1
and 1
made 1
him 1
fairly 1
hum 1
and 1
finally 1
skipped 1
off 1
and 1
made 1
his 1
bow 1
and 1
danced 1
off 1
to 1
the 1
dressing 1
room 1
and 1
everybody 1
just 1
a 1
howling 1
with 1
pleasure 1
and 1
astonishment 1
Then 1
the 1
ringmaster 1
he 1
see 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
fooled 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
sickest 1
ringmaster 1
you 1
ever 1
see 1
I 1
reckon 1
Why 1
it 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
men 1
He 1
had 1
got 1
up 1
that 1
joke 1
all 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
head 1
and 1
never 1
let 1
on 1
to 1
nobody 1
Well 1
I 1
felt 1
sheepish 1
enough 1
to 1
be 1
took 1
in 1
so 1
but 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
a 1
been 1
in 1
that 1
ringmaster 1
s 1
place 1
not 1
for 1
a 1
thousand 1
dollars 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
there 1
may 1
be 1
bullier 1
circuses 1
than 1
what 1
that 1
one 1
was 1
but 1
I 1
never 1
struck 1
them 1
yet 1
Anyways 1
it 1
was 1
plenty 1
good 1
enough 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
wherever 1
I 1
run 1
across 1
it 2
can 1
have 1
all 1
of 1
my 1
custom 1
every 1
time 1
Well 1
that 1
night 1
we 1
had 1
our 1
show 1
but 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
only 1
about 1
twelve 1
people 1
there 1
just 1
enough 1
to 1
pay 1
expenses 1
And 1
they 1
laughed 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
that 1
made 1
the 1
duke 1
mad 1
and 1
everybody 1
left 1
anyway 1
before 1
the 1
show 1
was 1
over 1
but 1
one 1
boy 1
which 1
was 1
asleep 1
So 1
the 1
duke 1
said 1
these 1
Arkansaw 1
lunkheads 1
couldn 1
t 1
come 1
up 1
to 1
Shakespeare 1
what 1
they 1
wanted 1
was 1
low 1
comedy 1
and 1
maybe 1
something 1
ruther 1
worse 1
than 1
low 1
comedy 1
he 1
reckoned 1
He 1
said 1
he 1
could 1
size 1
their 1
style 1
So 1
next 1
morning 1
he 1
got 1
some 1
big 1
sheets 1
of 1
wrapping 1
paper 1
and 1
some 1
black 1
paint 1
and 1
drawed 1
off 1
some 1
handbills 1
and 1
stuck 1
them 1
up 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
village 1
The 1
bills 1
said 1
CHAPTER 1
XXIII 1
WELL 1
all 1
day 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
was 1
hard 1
at 1
it 1
rigging 1
up 1
a 1
stage 1
and 1
a 1
curtain 1
and 1
a 1
row 1
of 1
candles 1
for 1
footlights 1
and 1
that 1
night 1
the 1
house 1
was 1
jam 1
full 1
of 1
men 1
in 1
no 1
time 1
When 1
the 1
place 1
couldn 1
t 1
hold 1
no 1
more 1
the 1
duke 1
he 1
quit 1
tending 1
door 1
and 1
went 1
around 1
the 1
back 1
way 1
and 1
come 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
stage 1
and 1
stood 1
up 1
before 1
the 1
curtain 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
little 1
speech 1
and 1
praised 1
up 1
this 1
tragedy 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
thrillingest 1
one 1
that 1
ever 1
was 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
on 1
a 1
bragging 1
about 1
the 1
tragedy 1
and 1
about 1
Edmund 1
Kean 1
the 1
Elder 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
play 1
the 1
main 1
principal 1
part 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
when 1
he 1
d 1
got 1
everybody 1
s 1
expectations 1
up 1
high 1
enough 1
he 1
rolled 1
up 1
the 1
curtain 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
minute 1
the 1
king 1
come 1
a 1
prancing 1
out 1
on 1
all 1
fours 1
naked 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
painted 1
all 1
over 1
ring 1
streaked 1
and 1
striped 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
colors 1
as 1
splendid 1
as 1
a 1
rainbow 1
And 1
but 1
never 1
mind 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
his 1
outfit 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
wild 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
awful 1
funny 1
The 1
people 1
most 1
killed 1
themselves 1
laughing 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
got 1
done 1
capering 1
and 1
capered 1
off 1
behind 1
the 1
scenes 1
they 1
roared 1
and 1
clapped 1
and 1
stormed 1
and 1
haw 1
hawed 1
till 1
he 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
done 1
it 1
over 1
again 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
they 1
made 1
him 1
do 1
it 1
another 1
time 1
Well 1
it 1
would 1
make 1
a 1
cow 1
laugh 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
shines 1
that 1
old 1
idiot 1
cut 1
Then 1
the 1
duke 1
he 1
lets 1
the 1
curtain 1
down 1
and 1
bows 1
to 1
the 1
people 1
and 1
says 1
the 1
great 1
tragedy 1
will 1
be 1
performed 1
only 1
two 1
nights 1
more 1
on 1
accounts 1
of 1
pressing 1
London 1
engagements 1
where 1
the 1
seats 1
is 1
all 1
sold 1
already 1
for 1
it 1
in 1
Drury 1
Lane 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
makes 1
them 1
another 1
bow 1
and 1
says 1
if 1
he 1
has 1
succeeded 1
in 1
pleasing 1
them 1
and 1
instructing 1
them 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
deeply 1
obleeged 1
if 1
they 1
will 1
mention 1
it 1
to 1
their 1
friends 1
and 1
get 1
them 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
see 1
it 1
Twenty 1
people 1
sings 1
out 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
over 1
Is 1
that 1
all 1
The 1
duke 1
says 1
yes 1
Then 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
fine 1
time 1
Everybody 1
sings 1
out 1
Sold 1
and 1
rose 1
up 1
mad 1
and 1
was 1
a 1
going 1
for 1
that 1
stage 1
and 1
them 1
tragedians 1
But 1
a 1
big 1
fine 1
looking 1
man 1
jumps 1
up 1
on 1
a 1
bench 1
and 1
shouts 1
Hold 1
on 1
Just 1
a 1
word 1
gentlemen 1
They 1
stopped 1
to 1
listen 1
We 1
are 1
sold 1
mighty 1
badly 1
sold 1
But 1
we 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
laughing 1
stock 1
of 1
this 1
whole 1
town 1
I 1
reckon 1
and 1
never 1
hear 1
the 1
last 1
of 1
this 1
thing 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
we 1
live 1
No 1
What 1
we 1
want 1
is 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
of 1
here 1
quiet 1
and 1
talk 1
this 1
show 1
up 1
and 1
sell 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
Then 1
we 1
ll 1
all 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
boat 1
Ain 1
t 1
that 1
sensible 1
You 1
bet 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
jedge 1
is 1
right 1

All 1

word 1
about 1

sell 1
Go 1
along 1
home 1
and 1
advise 1
everybody 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
see 1
the 1
tragedy 1
Next 1
day 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
hear 1
nothing 1
around 1
that 1
town 1
but 1
how 1
splendid 1
that 1
show 1
was 1
House 1
was 1
jammed 1
again 1
that 1
night 1
and 1
we 1
sold 1
this 1
crowd 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
When 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
got 1
home 1
to 1
the 1
raft 1
we 1
all 1
had 1
a 1
supper 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
about 1
midnight 1
they 1
made 1
Jim 1
and 1
me 1
back 1
her 1
out 1
and 1
float 1
her 1
down 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
fetch 1
her 1
in 1
and 1
hide 1
her 1
about 1
two 1
mile 1
below 1
town 1
The 1
third 1
night 1
the 1
house 1
was 1
crammed 1
again 1
and 1
they 1
warn 1
t 1
new 1
comers 1
this 1
time 1
but 1
people 1
that 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
show 1
the 1
other 1
two 1
nights 1
I 1
stood 1
by 1
the 1
duke 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
I 1
see 1
that 1
every 1
man 1
that 1
went 1
in 1
had 1
his 1
pockets 1
bulging 1
or 1
something 1
muffled 1
up 1
under 1
his 1
coat 1
and 1
I 1
see 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
perfumery 1
neither 1
not 1
by 1
a 1
long 1
sight 1
I 1
smelt 1
sickly 1
eggs 1
by 1
the 1
barrel 1
and 1
rotten 1
cabbages 1
and 1
such 1
things 1
and 1
if 1
I 1
know 1
the 1
signs 1
of 1
a 1
dead 1
cat 1
being 1
around 1
and 1
I 1
bet 1
I 1
do 1
there 1
was 1
sixty 1
four 1
of 1
them 1
went 1
in 1
I 1
shoved 1
in 1
there 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
various 1
for 1
me 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
stand 1
it 1
Well 1
when 1
the 1
place 1
couldn 1
t 1
hold 1
no 1
more 1
people 1
the 1
duke 1
he 1
give 1
a 1
fellow 1
a 1
quarter 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
to 1
tend 1
door 1
for 1
him 1
a 1
minute 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
started 1
around 1
for 1
the 1
stage 1
door 1
I 1
after 1
him 1
but 1
the 1
minute 1
we 1
turned 1
the 1
corner 1
and 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
he 1
says 1
Walk 1
fast 1
now 1
till 1
you 1
get 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
houses 1
and 1
then 1
shin 1
for 1
the 1
raft 1
like 1
the 1
dickens 1
was 1
after 1
you 1
I 1
done 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
done 1
the 1
same 1
We 1
struck 1
the 1
raft 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
and 1
in 1
less 1
than 1
two 1
seconds 1
we 1
was 1
gliding 1
down 1
stream 1
all 1
dark 1
and 1
still 1
and 1
edging 1
towards 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
nobody 1
saying 1
a 1
word 1
I 1
reckoned 1
the 1
poor 1
king 1
was 1
in 1
for 1
a 1
gaudy 1
time 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
the 1
audience 1
but 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
pretty 1
soon 1
he 1
crawls 1
out 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
wigwam 1
and 1
says 1
Well 1
how 1
d 1
the 1
old 1
thing 1
pan 1
out 1
this 1
time 1
duke 1
He 1
hadn 1
t 1
been 1
up 1
town 1
at 1
all 1
We 1
never 1
showed 1
a 1
light 1
till 1
we 1
was 1
about 1
ten 1
mile 1
below 1
the 1
village 1
Then 1
we 1
lit 1
up 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
supper 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
fairly 1
laughed 1
their 1
bones 1
loose 1
over 1
the 1
way 1
they 1
d 1
served 1
them 1
people 1
The 1
duke 1
says 1
Greenhorns 1
flatheads 1
I 1
knew 1
the 1
first 1
house 1
would 1
keep 1
mum 1
and 1
let 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
get 1
roped 1
in 1
and 1
I 1
knew 1
they 1
d 1
lay 1
for 1
us 1
the 1
third 1
night 1
and 1
consider 1
it 1
was 1
their 1
turn 1
now 1
Well 1

turn 1

would 1
just 1
like 1
to 1
know 1
how 1
they 1
re 1
putting 1
in 1
their 1
opportunity 1
They 1
can 1
turn 1
it 1
into 1
a 1
picnic 1
if 1
they 1
want 1
to 1
they 1
brought 1
plenty 1
provisions 1
Them 1

five 1
dollars 1
in 1

three 1
nights 1

By 1

He 1

blossom 1
He 1
used 1
to 1
marry 1
a 1
new 1
wife 1
every 1
day 1
and 1
chop 1
off 1
her 1
head 1
next 1
morning 1
And 1
he 1
would 1
do 1

indifferent 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
ordering 1
up 1
eggs 1
Fetch 1

him 1
a 1
tale 1
every 1
night 1
and 1
he 1
kept 1
that 1
up 1
till 1
he 1
had 1
hogged 1
a 1
thousand 1
and 1
one 1
tales 1
that 1
way 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
put 1
them 1
all 1
in 1
a 1
book 1
and 1
called 1
it 1
Domesday 1
Book 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
name 1
and 1
stated 1
the 1
case 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
kings 1
Jim 1
but 1
I 1
know 1
them 1
and 1
this 1
old 1
rip 1
of 1
ourn 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
cleanest 1
I 1
ve 1
struck 1
in 1
history 1
Well 1
Henry 1
he 1
takes 1
a 1
notion 1
he 1
wants 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
some 1
trouble 1
with 1
this 1
country 1
How 1
does 1
he 1
go 1
at 1
it 1
give 1
notice 1
give 1
the 1
country 1
a 1
show 1
No 1
All 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
he 1
heaves 1
all 1
the 1
tea 1
in 1
Boston 1
Harbor 1
overboard 1
and 1
whacks 1
out 1
a 1
declaration 1
of 1
independence 1
and 1
dares 1
them 1
to 1
come 1
on 1
That 1
was 1
his 1
style 1
he 1
never 1
give 1
anybody 1
a 1
chance 1
He 1
had 1
suspicions 1
of 1
his 1
father 1
the 1
Duke 1
of 1
Wellington 1
Well 1
what 1
did 1
he 1
do 1
Ask 1
him 1
to 1
show 1
up 1
No 1
drownded 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
butt 1
of 1
mamsey 1
like 1
a 1
cat 1
S 1
pose 1
people 1
left 1
money 1
laying 1
around 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
what 1
did 1
he 1
do 1
He 1
collared 1
it 1
S 1
pose 1
he 1
contracted 1
to 1
do 1
a 1
thing 1
and 1
you 1
paid 1
him 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
set 1
down 1
there 1
and 1
see 1
that 1
he 1
done 1
it 1
what 1
did 1
he 1
do 1
He 1
always 1
done 1
the 1
other 1
thing 1
S 1
pose 1
he 1
opened 1
his 1
mouth 1
what 1
then 1
If 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
shut 1
it 1
up 1
powerful 1
quick 1
he 1
d 1
lose 1
a 1
lie 1
every 1
time 1
That 1
s 1
the 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
bug 1
Henry 1
was 1
and 1
if 1
we 1
d 1
a 1
had 1
him 1
along 1
stead 1
of 1
our 1
kings 1
he 1
d 1
a 1
fooled 1
that 1
town 1
a 1
heap 1
worse 1
than 1
ourn 1
done 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
say 1
that 1
ourn 1
is 1
lambs 1
because 1
they 1
ain 1
t 1
when 1
you 1
come 1
right 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
cold 1
facts 1
but 1
they 1
ain 1
t 1
nothing 1
to 1
that 1
old 1
ram 1
anyway 1
All 1
I 1
say 1
is 1
kings 1
is 1
kings 1
and 1
you 1
got 1
to 1
make 1
allowances 1
Take 1
them 1
all 1
around 1

re 1
a 1
mighty 1
ornery 1
lot 1
It 1
s 1
the 1
way 1
they 1
re 1
raised 1
But 1
dis 1
one 1
do 1
smell 1
so 1
like 1

nation 1
Huck 1
Well 1
they 1
all 1
do 1
Jim 1
We 1
can 1
t 1
help 1
the 1
way 1
a 1
king 1
smells 1
history 1
don 1
t 1
tell 1
no 1
way 1
Now 1
de 1
duke 1
he 1
s 1
a 1
tolerble 1
likely 1
man 1
in 1
some 1
ways 1
Yes 1
a 1
duke 1
s 1
different 1
But 1
not 1
very 1
different 1
This 1
one 1
s 1
a 1
middling 1
hard 1
lot 1
for 1
a 1
duke 1
When 1
he 1
s 1
drunk 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
near 1
sighted 1
man 1
could 1
tell 1
him 1
from 1
a 1
king 1
Well 1

doan 1
hanker 1
for 1
no 1
mo 1

Huck 1
Dese 1
is 1
all 1
I 1
kin 1
stan 1
It 1

feel 1
too 1
Jim 1
But 1
we 1
ve 1
got 1
them 1
on 1
our 1
hands 1
and 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
remember 1
what 1
they 1
are 1
and 1
make 1
allowances 1
Sometimes 1
I 1
wish 1
we 1
could 1
hear 1
of 1
a 1
country 1
that 1
s 1
out 1
of 1
kings 1
What 1
was 1

use 1

warn 1
t 1
real 1
kings 1
and 1
dukes 1
It 1
wouldn 1
t 1
a 1
done 1
no 1
good 1
and 1
besides 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
as 1
I 1
said 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
tell 1
them 1
from 1
the 1
real 1
kind 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
sleep 1
and 1
Jim 1
didn 1
t 1
call 1
me 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
my 1
turn 1
He 1
often 1
done 1
that 1
When 1
I 1
waked 1
up 1
just 1
at 1
daybreak 1
he 1
was 1
sitting 1
there 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
down 1
betwixt 1
his 1
knees 1
moaning 1
and 1
mourning 1
to 1
himself 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
take 1
notice 1
nor 1
let 1
on 1
I 1
knowed 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
about 1
He 1
was 1
thinking 1
about 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
his 1
children 1
away 1
up 1
yonder 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
low 1
and 1
homesick 1
because 1
he 1
hadn 1
t 1
ever 1
been 1
away 1
from 1
home 1
before 1
in 1
his 1
life 1
and 1
I 1
do 1
believe 1
he 1
cared 1
just 1
as 1
much 1
for 1
his 1
people 1
as 1
white 1
folks 1
does 1
for 1
their 1
n 1
It 1
don 1
t 1
seem 1
natural 1
but 1
I 1
reckon 1
it 1
s 1
so 1
He 1
was 1
often 1
moaning 1
and 1
mourning 1
that 1
way 1
nights 1
when 1
he 1
judged 1
I 1
was 1
asleep 1
and 1
saying 1
Po 1

But 1

time 1
I 1
somehow 1
got 1
to 1
talking 1
to 1
him 1
about 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1

CHAPTER 1
XXIV 1
NEXT 1
day 1
towards 1
night 1
we 1
laid 1
up 1
under 1
a 1
little 1
willow 1
towhead 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
where 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
village 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
begun 1
to 1
lay 1
out 1
a 1
plan 1
for 1
working 1
them 1
towns 1
Jim 1
he 1
spoke 1
to 1
the 1
duke 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
hoped 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
take 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
because 1
it 1
got 1
mighty 1
heavy 1
and 1
tiresome 1
to 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
lay 1
all 1
day 1
in 1
the 1
wigwam 1
tied 1
with 1
the 1
rope 1
You 1
see 1
when 1
we 1
left 1
him 1
all 1
alone 1
we 1
had 1
to 1
tie 1
him 1
because 1
if 1
anybody 1
happened 1
on 1
to 1
him 1
all 1
by 1
himself 1
and 1
not 1
tied 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
look 1
much 1
like 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
runaway 1
nigger 1
you 1
know 1
So 1
the 1
duke 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
kind 1
of 1
hard 1
to 1
have 1
to 1
lay 1
roped 1
all 1
day 1
and 1
he 1
d 1
cipher 1
out 1
some 1
way 1
to 1
get 1
around 1
it 1
He 1
was 1
uncommon 1
bright 1
the 1
duke 1
was 1
and 1
he 1
soon 1
struck 1
it 1
He 1
dressed 1
Jim 1
up 1
in 1
King 1
Lear 1
s 1
outfit 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
curtain 1
calico 1
gown 1
and 1
a 1
white 1
horse 1
hair 1
wig 1
and 1
whiskers 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
his 1
theater 1
paint 1
and 1
painted 1
Jim 1
s 1
face 1
and 1
hands 1
and 1
ears 1
and 1
neck 1
all 1
over 1
a 1
dead 1
dull 1
solid 1
blue 1
like 1
a 1
man 1
that 1
s 1
been 1
drownded 1
nine 1
days 1
Blamed 1
if 1
he 1
warn 1
t 1
the 1
horriblest 1
looking 1
outrage 1
I 1
ever 1
see 1
Then 1
the 1
duke 1
took 1
and 1
wrote 1
out 1
a 1
sign 1
on 1
a 1
shingle 1
so 1
Sick 1
Arab 1
but 1
harmless 1
when 1
not 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
head 1
And 1
he 1
nailed 1
that 1
shingle 1
to 1
a 1
lath 1
and 1
stood 1
the 1
lath 1
up 1
four 1
or 1
five 1
foot 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
wigwam 1
Jim 1
was 1
satisfied 1
He 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
sight 1
better 1
than 1
lying 1
tied 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
years 1
every 1
day 1
and 1
trembling 1
all 1
over 1
every 1
time 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
sound 1
The 1
duke 1
told 1
him 1
to 1
make 1
himself 1
free 1
and 1
easy 1
and 1
if 1
anybody 1
ever 1
come 1
meddling 1
around 1
he 1
must 1
hop 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
wigwam 1
and 1
carry 1
on 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
fetch 1
a 1
howl 1
or 1
two 1
like 1
a 1
wild 1
beast 1
and 1
he 1
reckoned 1
they 1
would 1
light 1
out 1
and 1
leave 1
him 1
alone 1
Which 1
was 1
sound 1
enough 1
judgment 1
but 1
you 1
take 1
the 1
average 1
man 1
and 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
wait 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
howl 1
Why 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
only 1
look 1
like 1
he 1
was 1
dead 1
he 1
looked 1
considerable 1
more 1
than 1
that 1
These 1
rapscallions 1
wanted 1
to 1
try 1
the 1
Nonesuch 1
again 1
because 1
there 1
was 1
so 1
much 1
money 1
in 1
it 1
but 1
they 1
judged 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
be 1
safe 1
because 1
maybe 1
the 1
news 1
might 1
a 1
worked 1
along 1
down 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
They 1
couldn 1
t 1
hit 1
no 1
project 1
that 1
suited 1
exactly 1
so 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
duke 1
said 1
he 1
reckoned 1
he 1
d 1
lay 1
off 1
and 1
work 1
his 1
brains 1
an 1
hour 1
or 1
two 1
and 1
see 1
if 1
he 1
couldn 1
t 1
put 1
up 1
something 1
on 1
the 1
Arkansaw 1
village 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
he 1
allowed 1
he 1
would 1
drop 1
over 1
to 1
t 1
other 1
village 1
without 1
any 1
plan 1
but 1
just 1
trust 1
in 1
Providence 1
to 1
lead 1
him 1
the 1
profitable 1
way 1
meaning 1
the 1
devil 1
I 1
reckon 1
We 1
had 1
all 1
bought 1
store 1
clothes 1
where 1
we 1
stopped 1
last 1
and 1
now 1
the 1
king 1
put 1
his 1
n 1
on 1
and 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
put 1
mine 1
on 1
I 1
done 1
it 1
of 1
course 1
The 1
king 1
s 1
duds 1
was 1
all 1
black 1
and 1
he 1
did 1
look 1
real 1
swell 1
and 1
starchy 1
I 1
never 1
knowed 1
how 1
clothes 1
could 1
change 1
a 1
body 1
before 1
Why 1
before 1
he 1
looked 1
like 1
the 1
orneriest 1
old 1
rip 1
that 1
ever 1
was 1
but 1
now 1
when 1
he 1
d 1
take 1
off 1
his 1
new 1
white 1
beaver 1
and 1
make 1
a 1
bow 1
and 1
do 1
a 1
smile 1
he 1
looked 1
that 1
grand 1
and 1
good 1
and 1
pious 1
that 1
you 1
d 1
say 1
he 1
had 1
walked 1
right 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
ark 1
and 1
maybe 1
was 1
old 1
Leviticus 1
himself 1
Jim 1
cleaned 1
up 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
I 1
got 1
my 1
paddle 1
ready 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
big 1
steamboat 1
laying 1
at 1
the 1
shore 1
away 1
up 1
under 1
the 1
point 1
about 1
three 1
mile 1
above 1
the 1
town 1
been 1
there 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
hours 1
taking 1
on 1
freight 1
Says 1
the 1
king 1
Seein 1
how 1
I 1
m 1
dressed 1
I 1
reckon 1
maybe 1
I 1
better 1
arrive 1
down 1
from 1
St 1
Louis 1
or 1
Cincinnati 1
or 1
some 1
other 1
big 1
place 1
Go 1
for 1
the 1
steamboat 1
Huckleberry 1
we 1
ll 1
come 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
on 1
her 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
ordered 1
twice 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
take 1
a 1
steamboat 1
ride 1
I 1
fetched 1
the 1
shore 1
a 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
above 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
scooting 1
along 1
the 1
bluff 1
bank 1
in 1
the 1
easy 1
water 1
Pretty 1
soon 1
we 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
nice 1
innocent 1
looking 1
young 1
country 1
jake 1
setting 1
on 1
a 1
log 1
swabbing 1
the 1
sweat 1
off 1
of 1
his 1
face 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
powerful 1
warm 1
weather 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
big 1
carpet 1
bags 1
by 1
him 1
Run 1
her 1
nose 1
in 1
shore 1
says 1
the 1
king 1
I 1
done 1
it 1
Wher 1
you 1
bound 1
for 1
young 1
man 1
For 1
the 1
steamboat 1
going 1
to 1
Orleans 1
Git 1
aboard 1
says 1
the 1
king 1
Hold 1
on 1
a 1
minute 1
my 1
servant 1
ll 1
he 1
p 1
you 1
with 1
them 1
bags 1
Jump 1
out 1
and 1
he 1
p 1
the 1
gentleman 1
Adolphus 1
meaning 1
me 1
I 1
see 1
I 1
done 1
so 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
all 1
three 1
started 1
on 1
again 1
The 1
young 1
chap 1
was 1
mighty 1
thankful 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
tough 1
work 1
toting 1
his 1
baggage 1
such 1
weather 1
He 1
asked 1
the 1
king 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
told 1
him 1
he 1
d 1
come 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
landed 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
village 1
this 1
morning 1
and 1
now 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
up 1
a 1
few 1
mile 1
to 1
see 1
an 1
old 1
friend 1
on 1
a 1
farm 1
up 1
there 1
The 1
young 1
fellow 1
says 1
When 1

he 1

mighty 1
near 1

But 1
then 1
I 1
says 1
again 1
No 1

reckon 1

ain 1
t 1

or 1
else 1
he 1
wouldn 1

died 1
never 1

these 1
three 1
weeks 1
hadn 1
t 1

him 1
since 1
they 1
was 1
boys 1
together 1
and 1

t 1
ever 1

Peter 1
and 1
George 1

the 1
only 1
ones 1
that 1

out 1
here 1
George 1
was 1
the 1
married 1
brother 1

and 1
his 1
wife 1

last 1
year 1

and 1
William 1
s 1
the 1
only 1
ones 1

now 1
and 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
saying 1
they 1
haven 1
t 1
got 1
here 1
in 1
time 1
Did 1
anybody 1
send 1
em 1
word 1
Oh 1

a 1
month 1
or 1
two 1
ago 1
when 1
Peter 1
was 1
first 1
took 1
because 1
Peter 1
said 1
then 1
that 1
he 1
sorter 1
felt 1
like 1
he 1
warn 1
t 1
going 1
to 1
get 1
well 1
this 1
time 1
You 1
see 1
he 1
was 1
pretty 1
old 1
and 1
George 1
s 1
g 1
yirls 1
was 1
too 1
young 1
to 1
be 1
much 1
company 1
for 1
him 1
except 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
the 1
red 1
headed 1
one 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
was 1
kinder 1
lonesome 1
after 1
George 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
died 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
care 1
much 1
to 1
live 1
He 1
most 1
desperately 1
wanted 1
to 1
see 1
Harvey 1
and 1
William 1
too 1
for 1
that 1
matter 1
because 1
he 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
kind 1
that 1
can 1
t 1
bear 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
will 1
He 1
left 1
a 1
letter 1
behind 1
for 1
Harvey 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
d 1
told 1
in 1
it 1
where 1
his 1
money 1
was 1
hid 1
and 1
how 1
he 1
wanted 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
property 1
divided 1
up 1
so 1
George 1
s 1
g 1
yirls 1
would 1
be 1
all 1
right 1
for 1
George 1
didn 1
t 1
leave 1
nothing 1
And 1
that 1
letter 1
was 1
all 1
they 1
could 1
get 1
him 1
to 1
put 1
a 1
pen 1
to 1
Why 1

and 1
well 1
there 1
s 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
them 1
but 1
these 1
are 1
the 1
ones 1
that 1
Peter 1
was 1
thickest 1
with 1
and 1
used 1
to 1
write 1
about 1
sometimes 1
when 1
he 1
wrote 1
home 1
so 1
Harvey 1
ll 1
know 1
where 1
to 1
look 1
for 1
friends 1
when 1
he 1
gets 1
here 1
Well 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
went 1
on 1
asking 1
questions 1
till 1
he 1
just 1
fairly 1
emptied 1
that 1
young 1
fellow 1
Blamed 1
if 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
inquire 1
about 1
everybody 1
and 1
everything 1
in 1
that 1
blessed 1
town 1
and 1
all 1
about 1
the 1
Wilkses 1
and 1
about 1
Peter 1
s 1
business 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
tanner 1
and 1
about 1
George 1
s 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
carpenter 1
and 1
about 1
Harvey 1
s 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
dissentering 1
minister 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
Then 1
he 1
says 1
What 1
did 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
walk 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
steamboat 1
for 1
Because 1
she 1
s 1
a 1
big 1
Orleans 1
boat 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
afeard 1
she 1
mightn 1
t 1
stop 1
there 1
When 1
they 1
re 1
deep 1
they 1
won 1
t 1
stop 1
for 1
a 1
hail 1
A 1
Cincinnati 1
boat 1
will 1
but 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
St 1
Louis 1
one 1
Was 1
Peter 1
Wilks 1
well 1
off 1
Oh 1
yes 1
pretty 1
well 1
off 1
He 1
had 1
houses 1
and 1
land 1
and 1
it 1
s 1
reckoned 1
he 1
left 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
thousand 1
in 1
cash 1
hid 1
up 1
som 1
ers 1
When 1
did 1
you 1
say 1
he 1
died 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
say 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
last 1
night 1
Funeral 1
to 1
morrow 1
likely 1
Yes 1
bout 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
Well 1
it 1
s 1
all 1
terrible 1
sad 1
but 1
we 1
ve 1
all 1
got 1
to 1
go 1
one 1
time 1
or 1
another 1
So 1
what 1
we 1
want 1
to 1
do 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
prepared 1
then 1
we 1
re 1
all 1
right 1
Yes 1
sir 1
it 1
s 1
the 1
best 1
way 1
Ma 1
used 1
to 1
always 1
say 1
that 1
When 1
we 1
struck 1
the 1
boat 1
she 1
was 1
about 1
done 1
loading 1
and 1
pretty 1
soon 1
she 1
got 1
off 1
The 1
king 1
never 1
said 1
nothing 1
about 1
going 1
aboard 1
so 1
I 1
lost 1
my 1
ride 1
after 1
all 1
When 1
the 1
boat 1
was 1
gone 1
the 1
king 1
made 1
me 1
paddle 1
up 1
another 1
mile 1
to 1
a 1
lonesome 1
place 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
got 1
ashore 1
and 1
says 1
Now 1
hustle 1
back 1
right 1
off 1
and 1
fetch 1
the 1
duke 1
up 1
here 1
and 1
the 1
new 1
carpet 1
bags 1
And 1
if 1
he 1
s 1
gone 1
over 1
to 1
t 1
other 1
side 1
go 1
over 1
there 1
and 1
git 1
him 1
And 1
tell 1
him 1
to 1
git 1
himself 1
up 1
regardless 1
Shove 1
along 1
now 1
I 1
see 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
up 1
to 1
but 1
I 1
never 1
said 1
nothing 1
of 1
course 1
When 1
I 1
got 1
back 1
with 1
the 1
duke 1
we 1
hid 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
set 1
down 1
on 1
a 1
log 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
told 1
him 1
everything 1
just 1
like 1
the 1
young 1
fellow 1
had 1
said 1
it 1
every 1
last 1
word 1
of 1
it 1
And 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
doing 1
it 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
talk 1
like 1
an 1
Englishman 1
and 1
he 1
done 1
it 1
pretty 1
well 1
too 1
for 1
a 1
slouch 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
imitate 1
him 1
and 1
so 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
a 1
going 1
to 1
try 1
to 1
but 1
he 1
really 1
done 1
it 1
pretty 1
good 1
Then 1
he 1
says 1
How 1
are 1
you 1
on 1
the 1
deef 1
and 1
dumb 1
Bilgewater 1
The 1
duke 1
said 1
leave 1
him 1
alone 1
for 1
that 1
said 1
he 1
had 1
played 1
a 1
deef 1
and 1
dumb 1
person 1
on 1
the 1
histronic 1
boards 1
So 1
then 1
they 1
waited 1
for 1
a 1
steamboat 1
About 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
afternoon 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
little 1
boats 1
come 1
along 1
but 1
they 1
didn 1
t 1
come 1
from 1
high 1
enough 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
big 1
one 1
and 1
they 1
hailed 1
her 1
She 1
sent 1
out 1
her 1
yawl 1
and 1
we 1
went 1
aboard 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
from 1
Cincinnati 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
found 1
we 1
only 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
four 1
or 1
five 1
mile 1
they 1
was 1
booming 1
mad 1
and 1
gave 1
us 1
a 1
cussing 1
and 1
said 1
they 1
wouldn 1
t 1
land 1
us 1
But 1
the 1
king 1
was 1
ca 1
m 1
He 1
says 1
If 1
gentlemen 1
kin 1
afford 1
to 1
pay 1
a 1
dollar 1
a 1
mile 1
apiece 1
to 1
be 1
took 1
on 1
and 1
put 1
off 1
in 1
a 1
yawl 1
a 1
steamboat 1
kin 1
afford 1
to 1
carry 1
em 1
can 1
t 1
it 1
So 1
they 1
softened 1
down 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
when 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
they 1
yawled 1
us 1
ashore 1
About 1
two 1
dozen 1
men 1
flocked 1
down 1
when 1
they 1
see 1
the 1
yawl 1
a 1
coming 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
says 1
Kin 1
any 1
of 1
you 1
gentlemen 1
tell 1
me 1
wher 1
Mr 1
Peter 1
Wilks 1
lives 1
they 1
give 1
a 1
glance 1
at 1
one 1
another 1
and 1
nodded 1
their 1
heads 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
to 1
say 1
What 1
d 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
Then 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
says 1
kind 1
of 1
soft 1
and 1
gentle 1
I 1
m 1
sorry 1
sir 1
but 1
the 1
best 1
we 1
can 1
do 1
is 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
where 1
he 1
did 1
live 1
yesterday 1
evening 1
Sudden 1
as 1
winking 1
the 1
ornery 1
old 1
cretur 1
went 1
an 1
to 1
smash 1
and 1
fell 1
up 1
against 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
chin 1
on 1
his 1
shoulder 1
and 1
cried 1
down 1
his 1
back 1
and 1
says 1
Alas 1
alas 1
our 1
poor 1
brother 1
gone 1
and 1
we 1
never 1
got 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
oh 1
it 1
s 1
too 2
hard 1
Then 1
he 1
turns 1
around 1
blubbering 1
and 1
makes 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
idiotic 1
signs 1
to 1
the 1
duke 1
on 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
blamed 1
if 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
drop 1
a 1
carpet 1
bag 1
and 1
bust 1
out 1
a 1
crying 1
If 1
they 1
warn 1
t 1
the 1
beatenest 1
lot 1
them 1
two 1
frauds 1
that 1
ever 1
I 1
struck 1
Well 1
the 1
men 1
gathered 1
around 1
and 1
sympathized 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
said 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
kind 1
things 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
carried 1
their 1
carpet 1
bags 1
up 1
the 1
hill 1
for 1
them 1
and 1
let 1
them 1
lean 1
on 1
them 1
and 1
cry 1
and 1
told 1
the 1
king 1
all 1
about 1
his 1
brother 1
s 1
last 1
moments 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
he 1
told 1
it 1
all 1
over 1
again 1
on 1
his 1
hands 1
to 1
the 1
duke 1
and 1
both 1
of 1
them 1
took 1
on 1
about 1
that 1
dead 1
tanner 1
like 1
they 1
d 1
lost 1
the 1
twelve 1
disciples 1
Well 1
if 1
ever 1
I 1
struck 1
anything 1
like 1
it 1
I 1
m 1
a 1
nigger 1
It 1
was 1
enough 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
body 1
ashamed 1
of 1
the 1
human 1
race 1
CHAPTER 1
XXV 1
THE 1
news 1
was 1
all 1
over 1
town 1
in 1
two 1
minutes 1
and 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
people 1
tearing 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
run 1
from 1
every 1
which 1
way 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
putting 1
on 1
their 1
coats 1
as 1
they 1
come 1
Pretty 1
soon 1
we 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
a 1
crowd 1
and 1
the 1
noise 1
of 1
the 1
tramping 1
was 1
like 1
a 1
soldier 1
march 1
The 1
windows 1
and 1
dooryards 1
was 1
full 1
and 1
every 1
minute 1
somebody 1
would 1
say 1
over 1
a 1
fence 1
Is 1
it 1
them 1
And 1
somebody 1
trotting 1
along 1
with 1
the 1
gang 1
would 1
answer 1
back 1
and 1
say 1
You 1
bet 1
it 1
is 1
When 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
the 1
street 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
it 1
was 1
packed 1
and 1

three 1
girls 1
was 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
door 1

headed 1
but 1

don 1
t 1
make 1

difference 1

was 1
most 1
awful 1
beautiful 1
and 1

face 1
and 1
her 1
eyes 1
was 1
all 1
lit 1
up 1
like 1
glory 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
glad 1

The 1
king 1
he 1
spread 1
his 1
arms 1
and 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
she 1
jumped 1
for 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
hare 1
lip 1
jumped 1
for 1
the 1
duke 1
and 1
there 1
they 1
had 1
it 1
Everybody 1
most 1
leastways 1
women 1
cried 1
for 1
joy 1
to 1
see 1
them 1
meet 1
again 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
have 1
such 1
good 1
times 1
Then 1
the 1
king 1
he 1
hunched 1
the 1
duke 1
private 1
I 1
see 1

do 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
looked 1
around 1
and 1
see 1
the 1
coffin 1
over 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
on 1
two 1
chairs 1
so 1
then 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
with 1
a 1
hand 1
across 1
each 1
other 1
s 1
shoulder 1
and 1
t 1
other 1
hand 1
to 1
their 1
eyes 1
walked 1
slow 1
and 1
solemn 1
over 1
there 1
everybody 1
dropping 1
back 1
to 1
give 1
them 1
room 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
talk 1
and 1
noise 1
stopping 1
people 1
saying 1
Sh 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
men 1
taking 1
their 1
hats 1
off 1
and 1
drooping 1
their 1
heads 1
so 1
you 1
could 1
a 1
heard 1
a 1
pin 1
fall 1
And 1
when 1
they 1
got 1
there 1
they 1
bent 1
over 1
and 1
looked 1
in 1
the 1
coffin 1
and 1
took 1
one 1
sight 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
bust 1
out 1
a 1
crying 1
so 1
you 1
could 1
a 1
heard 1
them 1
to 1
Orleans 1
most 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
put 1
their 1
arms 1
around 1
each 1
other 1
s 1
necks 1
and 1
hung 1
their 1
chins 1
over 1
each 1
other 1
s 1
shoulders 1
and 1
then 1
for 1
three 1
minutes 1
or 1
maybe 1
four 1
I 1
never 1
see 1
two 1
men 1
leak 1
the 1
way 1
they 1
done 1
And 1
mind 1
you 1
everybody 1
was 1
doing 1
the 1
same 1
and 1
the 1
place 1
was 1
that 1
damp 1
I 1
never 1
see 1
anything 1
like 1
it 1
Then 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
got 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
coffin 1
and 1
t 1
other 1
on 1
t 1
other 1
side 1
and 1
they 1
kneeled 1
down 1
and 1
rested 1
their 1
foreheads 1
on 1
the 1
coffin 1
and 1
let 1
on 1
to 1
pray 1
all 1
to 1
themselves 1
Well 1
when 1
it 1
come 1
to 1
that 1
it 1
worked 1
the 1
crowd 1
like 1
you 1
never 1
see 1
anything 1
like 1
it 1
and 1
everybody 1
broke 1
down 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
sobbing 1
right 1
out 1
loud 1
the 1
poor 1
girls 1
too 1
and 1
every 1
woman 1
nearly 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
girls 1
without 1
saying 1
a 1
word 1
and 1
kissed 1
them 1
solemn 1
on 1
the 1
forehead 1
and 1
then 1
put 1
their 1
hand 1
on 1
their 1
head 1
and 1
looked 1
up 1
towards 1
the 1
sky 1
with 1
the 1
tears 1
running 1
down 1
and 1
then 1
busted 1
out 1
and 1
went 1
off 1
sobbing 1
and 1
swabbing 1
and 1
give 1
the 1
next 1
woman 1
a 1
show 1
I 1
never 1
see 1
anything 1
so 1
disgusting 1
Well 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
king 1
he 1
gets 1
up 1
and 1
comes 1
forward 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
works 1
himself 1
up 1
and 1
slobbers 1
out 1
a 1
speech 1
all 1
full 1
of 1
tears 1
and 1
flapdoodle 1
about 1
its 1
being 1
a 1
sore 1
trial 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
his 1
poor 1
brother 1
to 1
lose 1
the 1
diseased 1
and 1
to 1
miss 1
seeing 1
diseased 1
alive 1
after 1
the 1
long 1
journey 1
of 1
four 1
thousand 1
mile 1
but 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
trial 1
that 1
s 1
sweetened 1
and 1
sanctified 1
to 1
us 1
by 1
this 1
dear 1
sympathy 1
and 1
these 1
holy 1
tears 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
thanks 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
heart 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
brother 1
s 1
heart 1
because 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
mouths 1
they 1
can 1
t 1
words 1
being 1
too 1
weak 1
and 1
cold 1
and 1
all 1
that 1
kind 1
of 1
rot 1
and 1
slush 1
till 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
sickening 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
blubbers 1
out 1
a 1
pious 1
goody 2
Amen 1
and 1
turns 1
himself 1
loose 1
and 1
goes 1
to 1
crying 1
fit 1
to 1
bust 1
And 1
the 1
minute 1
the 1
words 1
were 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
mouth 1
somebody 1
over 1
in 1
the 1
crowd 1
struck 1
up 1
the 1
doxolojer 1
and 1
everybody 1
joined 1
in 1
with 1
all 1
their 1
might 1
and 1
it 1
just 1
warmed 1
you 1
up 1
and 1
made 1
you 1
feel 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
church 1
letting 1
out 1
Music 1
is 1
a 1
good 1
thing 1
and 1
after 1
all 1
that 1
soul 1
butter 1
and 1
hogwash 1
I 1
never 1
see 1
it 1
freshen 1
up 1
things 1
so 1
and 1
sound 1
so 1
honest 1
and 1
bully 1
Then 1
the 1
king 1
begins 1
to 1
work 1
his 1
jaw 1
again 1
and 1
says 1
how 1
him 1
and 1
his 1
nieces 1
would 1
be 1
glad 1
if 1
a 1
few 1
of 1
the 1
main 1
principal 1
friends 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
would 1
take 1
supper 1
here 1
with 1
them 1
this 1
evening 1
and 1
help 1
set 1
up 1
with 1
the 1
ashes 1
of 1
the 1
diseased 1
and 1
says 1
if 1
his 1
poor 1
brother 1
laying 1
yonder 1
could 1
speak 1
he 1
knows 1
who 1
he 1
would 1
name 1
for 1
they 1
was 1
names 1
that 1
was 1
very 1
dear 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
mentioned 1
often 1
in 1
his 1
letters 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
will 1
name 1
the 1
same 1
to 1
wit 1
as 1
follows 1
vizz 1
Rev 1
Mr 1
Hobson 1
and 1
Deacon 1
Lot 1
Hovey 1
and 1
Mr 1
Ben 1
Rucker 1
and 1
Abner 1
Shackleford 1
and 1
Levi 1
Bell 1
and 1
Dr 1
Robinson 1
and 1
their 1
wives 1
and 1
the 1
widow 1
Bartley 1
Rev 1
Hobson 1
and 1
Dr 1
Robinson 1
was 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
a 1
hunting 1
together 1
that 1
is 1
I 1
mean 1
the 1
doctor 1
was 1
shipping 1
a 1
sick 1
man 1
to 1
t 1
other 1
world 1
and 1
the 1
preacher 1
was 1
pinting 1
him 1
right 1
Lawyer 1
Bell 1
was 1
away 1
up 1
to 1
Louisville 1
on 1
business 1
But 1
the 1
rest 1
was 1
on 1
hand 1
and 1
so 1
they 1
all 1
come 1
and 1
shook 1
hands 1
with 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
thanked 1
him 1
and 1
talked 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
shook 1
hands 1
with 1
the 1
duke 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
say 1
nothing 1
but 1
just 1
kept 1
a 1
smiling 1
and 1
bobbing 1
their 1
heads 1
like 1
a 1
passel 1
of 1
sapheads 1
whilst 1
he 1
made 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
signs 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
said 1
Goo 1
goo 4
all 1
the 1
time 1
like 1
a 1
baby 1
that 1
can 1
t 1
talk 1
So 1
the 1
king 1
he 1
blattered 1
along 1
and 1
managed 1
to 1
inquire 1
about 1
pretty 1
much 1
everybody 1
and 1
dog 1
in 1
town 1
by 1
his 1
name 1
and 1
mentioned 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
little 1
things 1
that 1
happened 1
one 1
time 1
or 1
another 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
or 1
to 1
George 1
s 1
family 1
or 1
to 1
Peter 1
And 1
he 1
always 1
let 1
on 1
that 1
Peter 1
wrote 1
him 1
the 1
things 1
but 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
lie 1
he 1
got 1
every 1
blessed 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
that 1
young 1
flathead 1
that 1
we 1
canoed 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
steamboat 1
Then 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
she 1
fetched 1
the 1
letter 1
her 1
father 1
left 1
behind 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
he 1
read 1
it 1
out 1
loud 1
and 1
cried 1
over 1
it 1
It 1
give 1
the 1
dwelling 1
house 1
and 1
three 1
thousand 1
dollars 1
gold 1
to 1
the 1
girls 1
and 1
it 1
give 1
the 1
tanyard 1
which 1
was 1
doing 1
a 1
good 1
business 1
along 1
with 1
some 1
other 1
houses 1
and 1
land 1
worth 1
about 1
seven 1
thousand 1
and 1
three 1
thousand 1
dollars 1
in 1
gold 1
to 1
Harvey 1
and 1
William 1
and 1
told 1
where 1
the 1
six 1
thousand 1
cash 1
was 1
hid 1
down 1
cellar 1
So 1
these 1
two 1
frauds 1
said 1
they 1
d 1
go 1
and 1
fetch 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
have 1
everything 1
square 1
and 1
above 1
board 1
and 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
come 1
with 1
a 1
candle 1
We 1
shut 1
the 1
cellar 1
door 1
behind 1
us 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
found 1
the 1
bag 1
they 1
spilt 1
it 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
lovely 1
sight 1
all 1
them 1
yaller 1
boys 1
My 1
the 1
way 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
eyes 1
did 1
shine 1
He 1
slaps 1
the 1
duke 1
on 1
the 1
shoulder 1
and 1
says 1
Oh 1
this 1
ain 1
t 1
bully 1
nor 1
noth 1
n 1
Oh 1
no 1
I 1
reckon 1
not 1
Why 1
bully 1
it 1
beats 1
the 1
Nonesuch 1
don 1
t 1
it 1
The 1
duke 1
allowed 1
it 1
did 1
They 1
pawed 1
the 1
yaller 1
boys 1
and 1
sifted 1
them 1
through 1
their 1
fingers 1
and 1
let 1
them 1
jingle 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
says 1
It 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
use 1
talkin 1
bein 1
brothers 1
to 1
a 1
rich 1
dead 1
man 1
and 1
representatives 1
of 1
furrin 1
heirs 1
that 1
s 1
got 1
left 1
is 1
the 1
line 1
for 1
you 1
and 1
me 1
Bilge 1
Thish 1
yer 1
comes 1
of 1
trust 1
n 1
to 1
Providence 1
It 1
s 1
the 1
best 1
way 1
in 1
the 1
long 1
run 1
I 1
ve 1
tried 1
em 1
all 1
and 1
ther 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
better 1
way 1
Most 1
everybody 1
would 1
a 1
been 1
satisfied 1
with 1
the 1
pile 1
and 1
took 1
it 1
on 1
trust 1
but 1
no 1
they 1
must 1
count 1
it 1
So 1
they 1
counts 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
comes 1
out 1
four 1
hundred 1
and 1
fifteen 1
dollars 1
short 1
Says 1
the 1
king 1
Dern 1
him 1
I 1
wonder 1
what 1
he 1
done 1
with 1
that 1
four 1
hundred 1
and 1
fifteen 1
dollars 1
They 1
worried 1
over 1
that 1
awhile 1
and 1
ransacked 1
all 1
around 1
for 1
it 1
Then 1
the 1
duke 1
says 1
Well 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
pretty 1
sick 1
man 1
and 1
likely 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
mistake 1
I 1
reckon 1
that 1
s 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
it 1
The 1
best 1
way 1

to 1
let 1
it 1
go 1
and 1
keep 1

and 1
the 1

up 1
three 1
hundred 1
dollars 1
in 1
a 1
pile 1
twenty 1
elegant 1
little 1
piles 1
Everybody 1
looked 1
hungry 1
at 1

and 1
licked 1
their 1
chops 1
Then 1
they 1
raked 1
it 1
into 1
the 1

again 1
and 1
I 1
see 1
the 1
king 1
begin 1
to 1

himself 1
up 1
for 1
another 1
speech 1
He 1
says 1

The 1

CHAPTER 1
XXVI 1
WELL 1
when 1
they 1

the 1
king 1
he 1
asks 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
how 1
they 1
was 1

for 1
spare 1
rooms 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
she 1
had 1
one 1
spare 1
room 1
which 1
would 1
do 1
for 1
Uncle 1
William 1
and 1
she 1
d 1
give 1
her 1
own 1
room 1
to 1
Uncle 1
Harvey 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
bigger 1
and 1
she 1
would 1
turn 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
with 1
her 1
sisters 1
and 1
sleep 1
on 1
a 1
cot 1
and 1
up 1
garret 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
cubby 1
with 1
a 1
pallet 1
in 1
it 1
The 1
king 1
said 1
the 1
cubby 1
would 1
do 1
for 1
his 1
valley 1
meaning 1
me 1
So 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
took 1
us 1
up 1
and 1
she 1
showed 1
them 1
their 1
rooms 1
which 1
was 1
plain 1
but 1
nice 1
She 1
said 1
she 1
d 1

her 1
frocks 1
and 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
other 1
traps 1
took 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
room 1
if 1
they 1
was 1
in 1
Uncle 1
Harvey 1
s 1
way 1
but 1
he 1
said 1
they 1
warn 1
t 1
The 1
frocks 1
was 1
hung 1
along 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
before 1
them 1
was 1
a 1
curtain 1
made 1
out 1
of 1
calico 1
that 1
hung 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
floor 1
There 1

an 1
old 1
hair 1
trunk 1

one 1
corner 1
and 1

The 1

more 1
homely 1
and 1
more 1
pleasanter 1

The 1

That 1

head 1
of 1

and 1

I 1

I 1
was 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
s 1
servant 1
But 1
next 1
minute 1
I 1
whirled 1
in 1
on 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
an 1
explanation 1
how 1
a 1
valley 1
was 1
different 1
from 1
a 1
common 1
servant 1
and 1
had 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
church 1
whether 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
or 1
not 1
and 1
set 1
with 1
the 1
family 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
its 1
being 1
the 1
law 1
But 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
do 1
it 1
pretty 1
good 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
got 1
done 1
I 1
see 1
she 1
warn 1
t 1
satisfied 1
She 1
says 1
Honest 1
injun 1
now 1

t 1
you 1
been 1
telling 1
me 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
lies 1
Honest 1
injun 1
says 1
I 1
None 1
of 1
it 1
at 1
all 1
None 1
of 1

Not 1
a 1
lie 1

says 1
I 1
Lay 1

hand 1
on 1
this 1
book 1
and 1
say 1
it 1
I 1
see 1

nothing 1
but 1
a 1
dictionary 1
so 1
I 1
laid 1
my 1
hand 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
So 1
then 1
she 1
looked 1
a 1
little 1
better 1
satisfied 1
and 1
says 1
Well 1
then 1
I 1
ll 1
believe 1
some 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
I 1
hope 1
to 1
gracious 1
if 1
I 1
ll 1
believe 1

rest 1
What 1
is 1

won 1
t 1

Joe 1
says 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
stepping 1
in 1
with 1
Susan 1
behind 1
her 1
It 1
ain 1
t 1
right 1
nor 1
kind 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
talk 1
so 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
him 1
a 1
stranger 1
and 1
so 1
far 1
from 1
his 1
people 1
How 1
would 1
you 1
like 1
to 1
be 1
treated 1
so 1
That 1
s 1
always 1
your 1
way 1
Maim 1
always 1
sailing 1
in 1
to 1
help 1
somebody 1
before 1
they 1
re 1
hurt 1
I 1
hain 1
t 1
done 1
nothing 1
to 1
him 1
He 1
s 1
told 1
some 1
stretchers 1
I 1
reckon 1
and 1
I 1
said 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
swallow 1
it 1
all 1
and 1
that 1
s 1
every 1
bit 1
and 1
grain 1
I 1
did 1
say 1
I 1
reckon 1
he 1
can 1
stand 1
a 1
little 1
thing 1
like 1
that 1
can 1
t 1
he 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
whether 1
twas 1
little 1
or 1
whether 1
twas 1
big 1
he 1
s 1
here 1
in 1
our 1
house 1
and 1
a 1
stranger 1
and 1
it 1
wasn 1
t 1
good 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
say 1
it 1
If 1
you 1
was 1
in 1
his 1
place 1
it 1
would 1
make 1
you 1
feel 1
ashamed 1
and 1
so 1
you 1
oughtn 1
t 1
to 1
say 1
a 1
thing 1
to 1
another 1
person 1
that 1
will 1
make 1
them 1
feel 1
ashamed 1
Why 1
Mam 1
he 1
said 1
It 1
don 1
t 1
make 1
no 1
difference 1
what 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
ain 1
t 1
the 1
thing 1
The 1
thing 1
is 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
treat 1
him 1
kind 1
and 1
not 1
be 1
saying 1
things 1
to 1
make 1
him 1
remember 1
he 1
ain 1
t 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
country 1
and 1
amongst 1
his 1
own 1
folks 1
I 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
girl 1
that 1
I 1
m 1
letting 1
that 1
old 1
reptile 1
rob 1
her 1
of 1
her 1
money 1
Then 1
Susan 1
she 1
waltzed 1
in 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
ll 1
believe 1
me 1
she 1
did 1
give 1
Hare 1
lip 1
hark 1
from 1
the 1
tomb 1
Says 1
I 1
to 1
myself 1
and 1
this 1
is 1
another 1
one 1
that 1
I 1
m 1
letting 1
him 1
rob 1
her 1
of 1
her 1
money 1
Then 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
she 1
took 1
another 1
inning 1
and 1
went 1
in 1
sweet 1
and 1
lovely 1
again 1
which 1
was 1
her 1
way 1
but 1
when 1
she 1
got 1
done 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
hardly 1
anything 1
left 1
o 1
poor 1
Hare 1
lip 1
So 1
she 1
hollered 1
All 1
right 1
then 1
says 1
the 1
other 1
girls 1
you 1
just 1
ask 1
his 1
pardon 1
She 1
done 1
it 1
too 1
and 1
she 1
done 1
it 1
beautiful 1
She 1
done 1
it 1
so 1
beautiful 1
it 1
was 1
good 1
to 1
hear 1
and 1
I 1
wished 1
I 1
could 1
tell 1
her 1
a 1
thousand 1
lies 1
so 1
she 1
could 1
do 1
it 1
again 1
I 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
this 1
is 1
another 1
one 1
that 1
I 1
m 1
letting 1
him 1
rob 1
her 1
of 1
her 1
money 1
And 1
when 1
she 1
got 1
through 1
they 1
all 1
jest 1
laid 1
theirselves 1
out 1
to 1
make 1
me 1
feel 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
know 1
I 1
was 1
amongst 1
friends 1
I 1
felt 1
so 1
ornery 1
and 1
low 1
down 1
and 1
mean 1
that 1
I 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
my 1
mind 1
s 1
made 1
up 1
I 1
ll 1
hive 1
that 1
money 1
for 1
them 1
or 1
bust 1
So 1
then 1
I 1
lit 1
out 1
for 1
bed 1
I 1
said 1
meaning 1
some 1
time 1
or 1
another 1
When 1
I 1
got 1
by 1
myself 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
thinking 1
the 1
thing 1
over 1
I 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
shall 1
I 1
go 1
to 1
that 1
doctor 1
private 1
and 1
blow 1
on 1
these 1
frauds 1
No 1
that 1
won 1
t 1
do 1
He 1
might 1
tell 1
who 1
told 1
him 1
then 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
would 1
make 1
it 1
warm 1
for 1
me 1
Shall 1
I 1
go 1
private 1
and 1
tell 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
No 1
I 1
dasn 1
t 1
do 1
it 1
Her 1
face 1
would 1
give 1
them 1
a 1
hint 1
sure 1
they 1
ve 1
got 1
the 1
money 1
and 1
they 1
d 1
slide 1
right 1
out 1
and 1
get 1
away 1
with 1
it 1
If 1
she 1
was 1
to 1
fetch 1
in 1
help 1
I 1
d 1
get 1
mixed 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
business 1
before 1
it 1
was 1
done 1
with 1
I 1
judge 1
No 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
good 1
way 1
but 1
one 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
steal 1
that 1
money 1
somehow 1
and 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
steal 1
it 1
some 1
way 1
that 1
they 1
won 1
t 1
suspicion 1
that 1
I 1
done 1
it 1
They 1
ve 1
got 1
a 1
good 1
thing 1
here 1
and 1
they 1
ain 1
t 1
a 1
going 1
to 1
leave 1
till 1
they 1
ve 1
played 1
this 1
family 1
and 1
this 1
town 1
for 1
all 1
they 1
re 1
worth 1
so 1
I 1
ll 1
find 1
a 1
chance 1
time 1
enough 1
I 1
ll 1
steal 1
it 1
and 1
hide 1
it 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
when 1
I 1
m 1
away 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
I 1
ll 1
write 1
a 1
letter 1
and 1
tell 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
where 1
it 1
s 1
hid 1
But 1
I 1
better 1
hive 1
it 1
tonight 1
if 1
I 1
can 1
because 1
the 1
doctor 1
maybe 1
hasn 1
t 1
let 1
up 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
he 1
lets 1
on 1
he 1
has 1
he 1
might 1
scare 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
here 1
yet 1
So 1
thinks 1
I 2
ll 1
go 1
and 1
search 1
them 1
rooms 1
Upstairs 1
the 1
hall 1
was 1
dark 1
but 1
I 1
found 1
the 1
duke 1
s 1
room 1
and 1
started 1
to 1
paw 1
around 1
it 1
with 1
my 1
hands 1
but 1
I 1
recollected 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
be 1
much 1
like 1
the 1
king 1
to 1
let 1
anybody 1
else 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
that 1
money 1
but 1
his 1
own 1
self 1
so 1
then 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
his 1
room 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
paw 1
around 1
there 1
But 1
I 1
see 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
do 1
nothing 1
without 1
a 1
candle 1
and 1
I 1
dasn 1
t 1
light 1
one 1
of 1
course 1
So 1
I 1
judged 1
I 1
d 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
other 1
thing 1
lay 1
for 1
them 1
and 1
eavesdrop 1
About 1
that 1
time 1
I 1
hears 1
their 1
footsteps 1
coming 1
and 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
skip 1
under 1
the 1
bed 1
I 1
reached 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
it 1
wasn 1
t 1
where 1
I 1
thought 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
but 1
I 1
touched 1
the 1
curtain 1
that 1
hid 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
s 1
frocks 1
so 1
I 1
jumped 1
in 1
behind 1
that 1
and 1
snuggled 1
in 1
amongst 1
the 1
gowns 1
and 1
stood 1
there 1
perfectly 1
still 1
They 1
come 1
in 1
and 1
shut 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
the 1
duke 1
done 1
was 1
to 1
get 1
down 1
and 1
look 1
under 1
the 1
bed 1
Then 1
I 1
was 1
glad 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
found 1
the 1
bed 1
when 1
I 1
wanted 1
it 1
And 1
yet 1
you 1
know 1
it 1
s 1
kind 1
of 1
natural 1
to 1
hide 1
under 1
the 1
bed 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
up 1
to 1
anything 1
private 1
They 1
sets 1
down 1
then 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
says 1
Well 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
And 1
cut 1
it 1
middlin 1
short 1
because 1
it 1
s 1
better 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
be 1
down 1
there 1
a 1
whoopin 1
up 1
the 1
mournin 1
than 1
up 1
here 1
givin 1
em 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
talk 1

over 1
Well 1
this 1
is 1
it 1
Capet 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
easy 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
comfortable 1
That 1
doctor 1
lays 1
on 1
my 1
mind 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
your 1
plans 1
I 1
ve 1
got 1
a 1
notion 1
and 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
sound 1
one 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
duke 1
That 1
we 1
better 1
glide 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
before 1
three 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
clip 1
it 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
with 1
what 1
we 1
ve 1
got 1
Specially 1
seeing 1
we 1
got 1
it 1
so 1
easy 1
given 1
back 1
to 1
us 1
flung 1
at 1
our 1
heads 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
say 1
when 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
allowed 1
to 1
have 1
to 1
steal 1
it 1
back 1
I 1
m 1
for 1
knocking 1
off 1
and 1
lighting 1
out 1
That 1
made 1
me 1
feel 1
pretty 1
bad 1
About 1
an 1
hour 1
or 1
two 1
ago 1
it 1
would 1
a 1
been 1
a 1
little 1
different 1
but 1
now 1
it 1
made 1
me 1
feel 1
bad 1
and 1
disappointed 1
The 1
king 1
rips 1
out 1
and 1
says 1
What 1
And 1
not 1
sell 1
out 1
the 1
rest 1
o 1

March 1

The 1
duke 1
he 1
grumbled 1
said 1
the 1
bag 1
of 1
gold 1
was 1
enough 1
and 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1

didn 1
t 1

Why 1

The 1

Why 1

Bless 1

they 1

of 1
Well 1
the 1
king 1
he 1
talked 1
him 1
blind 1
so 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
give 1
in 1
and 1
said 1
all 1
right 1
but 1
said 1
he 1
believed 1
it 1
was 1
blamed 1
foolishness 1
to 1
stay 1
and 1
that 1
doctor 1
hanging 1
over 1
them 1
But 1
the 1
king 1
says 1
Cuss 1
the 1
doctor 1
What 1
do 1
we 1
k 1
yer 1
for 1
him 1
Hain 1
t 1
we 1
got 1
all 1
the 1
fools 1
in 1
town 1
on 1
our 1
side 1
And 1
ain 1
t 1
that 1
a 1
big 1
enough 1
majority 1
in 1
any 1
town 1
So 1
they 1
got 1
ready 1
to 1
go 1
down 1
stairs 1
again 1
The 1
duke 1
says 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
we 1
put 1
that 1
money 1
in 1
a 1
good 1
place 1
That 1
cheered 1
me 1
up 1
I 1
d 1
begun 1
to 1
think 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
going 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
hint 1
of 1
no 1
kind 1
to 1
help 1
me 1
The 1
king 1
says 1
Why 1
Because 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
ll 1
be 1
in 1
mourning 1
from 1
this 1
out 1
and 1
first 1
you 1
know 1
the 1
nigger 1
that 1
does 1
up 1
the 1
rooms 1
will 1
get 1
an 1
order 1
to 1
box 1
these 1
duds 1
up 1
and 1
put 1
em 1
away 1
and 1
do 1
you 1
reckon 1
a 1
nigger 1
can 1
run 1
across 1
money 1
and 1
not 1
borrow 1
some 1
of 1
it 1
Your 1
head 1
s 1
level 1
agin 1
duke 1
says 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
he 1
comes 1
a 1
fumbling 1
under 1
the 1
curtain 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
foot 1
from 1
where 1
I 1
was 1
I 1
stuck 1
tight 1
to 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
kept 1
mighty 1
still 1
though 1
quivery 1
and 1
I 1
wondered 1
what 1
them 1
fellows 1
would 1
say 1
to 1
me 1
if 1
they 1
catched 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
tried 1
to 1
think 1
what 1
I 1
d 1
better 1
do 1
if 1
they 1
did 1
catch 1
me 1
But 1
the 1
king 1
he 1
got 1
the 1
bag 1
before 1
I 1
could 1
think 1
more 1
than 1
about 1
a 1
half 1
a 1
thought 1
and 1
he 1
never 1
suspicioned 1
I 1
was 1
around 1
They 1
took 1
and 1
shoved 1
the 1
bag 1
through 1
a 1
rip 1
in 1
the 1
straw 1
tick 1
that 1
was 1
under 1
the 1
feather 1
bed 1
and 1
crammed 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
foot 1
or 1
two 1
amongst 1
the 1
straw 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
now 1
because 1
a 1
nigger 1
only 1
makes 1
up 1
the 1
feather 1
bed 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
turn 1
over 1
the 1
straw 1
tick 1
only 1
about 1
twice 1
a 1
year 1
and 1
so 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
in 1
no 1
danger 1
of 1
getting 1
stole 1
now 1
But 1
I 1
knowed 1
better 1
I 1
had 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
there 1
before 1
they 1
was 1
half 1
way 1
down 1
stairs 1
I 1
groped 1
along 1
up 1
to 1
my 1
cubby 1
and 1
hid 1
it 1
there 1
till 1
I 1
could 1
get 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
do 1
better 1
I 1
judged 1
I 1
better 1
hide 1
it 1
outside 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
somewheres 1
because 1
if 1
they 1
missed 1
it 1
they 1
would 1
give 1
the 1
house 1
a 1
good 1
ransacking 1
I 1
knowed 1
that 1
very 1
well 1
Then 1
I 1
turned 1
in 1
with 1
my 1
clothes 1
all 1
on 1
but 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
a 1
gone 1
to 1
sleep 1
if 1
I 1
d 1
a 1
wanted 1
to 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
sweat 1
to 1
get 1
through 1
with 1
the 1
business 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
come 1
up 1
so 1
I 1
rolled 1
off 1
my 1
pallet 1
and 1
laid 1
with 1
my 1
chin 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
my 1
ladder 1
and 1
waited 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
anything 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
happen 1
But 1
nothing 1
did 1
So 1
I 1
held 1
on 1
till 1
all 1
the 1
late 1
sounds 1
had 1
quit 1
and 1
the 1
early 1
ones 1
hadn 1
t 1
begun 1
yet 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
slipped 1
down 1
the 1
ladder 1
CHAPTER 1
XXVII 1
I 1
crept 1
to 1
their 1
doors 1
and 1
listened 1
they 1
was 1
snoring 1
So 1
I 1
tiptoed 1
along 1
and 1
got 1
down 1
stairs 1
all 1
right 1
There 1
warn 1
t 1
a 1
sound 1
anywheres 1
I 1
peeped 1
through 1
a 1
crack 1
of 1
the 1
dining 1
room 1
door 1
and 1
see 1
the 1
men 1
that 1
was 1
watching 1
the 1
corpse 1
all 1
sound 1
asleep 1
on 1
their 1
chairs 1
The 1
door 1
was 1
open 1
into 1
the 1
parlor 1
where 1
the 1
corpse 1
was 1
laying 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
candle 1
in 1
both 1
rooms 1
I 1
passed 1
along 1
and 1
the 1
parlor 1
door 1
was 1
open 1
but 1
I 1
see 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
nobody 1
in 1
there 1
but 1
the 1
remainders 1
of 1
Peter 1
so 1
I 1
shoved 1
on 1
by 1
but 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
was 1
locked 1
and 1
the 1
key 1
wasn 1
t 1
there 1
Just 1
then 1
I 1
heard 1
somebody 1
coming 1
down 1
the 1
stairs 1
back 1
behind 1
me 1
I 1
run 1
in 1
the 1
parlor 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
swift 1
look 1
around 1
and 1
the 1
only 1
place 1
I 1
see 1
to 1
hide 1
the 1
bag 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
coffin 1
The 1
lid 1
was 1
shoved 1
along 1
about 1
a 1
foot 1
showing 1
the 1
dead 1
man 1
s 1
face 1
down 1
in 1
there 1
with 1
a 1
wet 1
cloth 1
over 1
it 1
and 1
his 1
shroud 1
on 1
I 1
tucked 1
the 1
money 1
bag 1
in 1
under 1
the 1
lid 1
just 1
down 1
beyond 1
where 1
his 1
hands 1
was 1
crossed 1
which 1
made 1
me 1
creep 1
they 1
was 1
so 1
cold 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
run 1
back 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
in 1
behind 1
the 1
door 1
The 1
person 1
coming 1
was 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
She 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
coffin 1
very 1
soft 1
and 1
kneeled 1
down 1
and 1
looked 1
in 1
then 1
she 1
put 1
up 1
her 1
handkerchief 1
and 1
I 1
see 1
she 1
begun 1
to 1
cry 1
though 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
hear 1
her 1
and 1
her 1
back 1
was 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
slid 1
out 1
and 1
as 1
I 1
passed 1
the 1
dining 1
room 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
d 1
make 1
sure 1
them 1
watchers 1
hadn 1
t 1
seen 1
me 1
so 1
I 1
looked 1
through 1
the 1
crack 1
and 1
everything 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
They 1
hadn 1
t 1
stirred 1
I 1
slipped 1
up 1
to 1
bed 1
feeling 1
ruther 1
blue 1
on 1
accounts 1
of 1
the 1
thing 1
playing 1
out 1
that 1
way 1
after 1
I 1
had 1
took 1
so 1
much 1
trouble 1
and 1
run 1
so 1
much 1
resk 1
about 1
it 1
Says 1
I 1
if 1
it 1
could 1
stay 1
where 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
right 1
because 1
when 1
we 1
get 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
a 1
hundred 1
mile 1
or 1
two 1
I 1
could 1
write 1
back 1
to 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
and 1
she 1
could 1
dig 1
him 1
up 1
again 1
and 1
get 1
it 1
but 1
that 1
ain 1
t 1
the 1
thing 1
that 1
s 1
going 1
to 1
happen 1
the 1
thing 1
that 1
s 1
going 1
to 1
happen 1
is 1
the 1
money 1
ll 1
be 1
found 1
when 1
they 1
come 1
to 1
screw 1
on 1
the 1
lid 1
Then 1
the 1
king 1
ll 1
get 1
it 1
again 1
and 1
it 1
ll 1
be 1
a 1
long 1
day 1
before 1
he 1
gives 1
anybody 1
another 1
chance 1
to 1
smouch 1
it 1
from 1
him 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
slide 1
down 1
and 1
get 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
there 1
but 1
I 1
dasn 1
t 1
try 1
it 1
Every 1
minute 1
it 1
was 1
getting 1
earlier 1
now 1
and 1
pretty 1
soon 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
watchers 1
would 1
begin 1
to 1
stir 1
and 1
I 1
might 1
get 1
catched 2
with 1
six 1
thousand 1
dollars 1
in 1
my 1
hands 1
that 1
nobody 1
hadn 1
t 1
hired 1
me 1
to 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
mixed 1
up 1
in 1
no 1
such 1
business 1
as 1
that 1
I 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
When 1
I 1
got 1
down 1
stairs 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
the 1
parlor 1
was 1
shut 1
up 1
and 1
the 1
watchers 1
was 1
gone 1
There 1
warn 1
t 1
nobody 1
around 1
but 1
the 1
family 1
and 1
the 1
widow 1
Bartley 1
and 1
our 1
tribe 1
I 1
watched 1
their 1
faces 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
anything 1
had 1
been 1
happening 1
but 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
tell 1
Towards 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
the 1
undertaker 1
come 1
with 1
his 1
man 1
and 1
they 1
set 1
the 1
coffin 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
on 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
chairs 1
and 1
then 1
set 1
all 1
our 1
chairs 1
in 1
rows 1
and 1
borrowed 1
more 1
from 1
the 1
neighbors 1
till 1
the 1
hall 1
and 1
the 1
parlor 1
and 1
the 1
dining 1
room 1
was 1
full 1
I 1
see 1
the 1
coffin 1
lid 1
was 1
the 1
way 1
it 1
was 1
before 1
but 1
I 1
dasn 1
t 1
go 1
to 1
look 1
in 1
under 1
it 1
with 1
folks 1
around 1
Then 1
the 1
people 1
begun 1
to 1
flock 1
in 1
and 1
the 1
beats 1
and 1
the 1
girls 1
took 1
seats 1
in 1
the 1
front 1
row 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
coffin 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
the 1
people 1
filed 1
around 1
slow 1
in 1
single 1
rank 1
and 1
looked 1
down 1
at 1
the 1
dead 1
man 1
s 1
face 1
a 1
minute 1
and 1
some 1
dropped 1
in 1
a 1
tear 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
very 1
still 1
and 1
solemn 1
only 1
the 1
girls 1
and 1
the 1
beats 1
holding 1
handkerchiefs 1
to 1
their 1
eyes 1
and 1
keeping 1
their 1
heads 1
bent 1
and 1
sobbing 1
a 1
little 1
There 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
other 1
sound 1
but 1
the 1
scraping 1
of 1
the 1
feet 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
blowing 1
noses 1
because 1
people 1
always 1
blows 1
them 1
more 1
at 1
a 1
funeral 1
than 1
they 1
do 1
at 1
other 1
places 1
except 1
church 1
When 1
the 1
place 1
was 1
packed 1
full 1
the 1
undertaker 1
he 1
slid 1
around 1
in 1
his 1
black 1
gloves 1
with 1
his 1
softy 1
soothering 1
ways 1
putting 1
on 1
the 1
last 1
touches 1
and 1
getting 1
people 1
and 1
things 1
all 1
ship 1
shape 1
and 1
comfortable 1
and 1
making 1
no 1
more 1
sound 1
than 1
a 1
cat 1
He 1
never 1
spoke 1
he 1
moved 1
people 1
around 1
he 1
squeezed 1
in 1
late 1
ones 1
he 1
opened 1
up 1
passageways 1
and 1
done 1
it 1
with 1
nods 1
and 1
signs 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
Then 1
he 1
took 1
his 1
place 1
over 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
He 1
was 1
the 1
softest 1
glidingest 1
stealthiest 1
man 1
I 1
ever 1
see 1
and 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
more 1
smile 1
to 1
him 1
than 1
there 1
is 1
to 1
a 1
ham 1
They 1
had 1
borrowed 1
a 1
melodeum 1
a 1
sick 1
one 1
and 1
when 1
everything 1
was 1
ready 1
a 1
young 1
woman 1
set 1
down 1
and 1
worked 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
pretty 1
skreeky 1
and 1
colicky 1
and 1
everybody 1
joined 1
in 1
and 1
sung 1
and 1
Peter 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
that 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
thing 1
according 1
to 1
my 1
notion 1
Then 1
the 1
Reverend 1
Hobson 1
opened 1
up 1
slow 1
and 1
solemn 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
talk 1
and 1
straight 1
off 1
the 1
most 1
outrageous 1
row 1
busted 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
cellar 1
a 1
body 1
ever 1
heard 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
one 1
dog 1
but 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
most 1
powerful 1
racket 1
and 1
he 1
kept 1
it 1
up 1
right 1
along 1
the 1
parson 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
stand 1
there 1
over 1
the 1
coffin 1
and 1
wait 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
hear 1
yourself 1
think 1
It 1
was 1
right 1
down 1
awkward 1
and 1
nobody 1
didn 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
But 1
pretty 1
soon 1
they 1
see 1
that 1
long 1
legged 1
undertaker 1
make 1
a 1
sign 1
to 1
the 1
preacher 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
to 1
say 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
worry 1
just 1
depend 1
on 1
me 1
Then 1
he 1
stooped 1
down 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
glide 1
along 1
the 1
wall 1
just 1
his 1
shoulders 1
showing 1
over 1
the 1
people 1
s 1
heads 1
So 1
he 1
glided 1
along 1
and 1
the 1
powwow 1
and 1
racket 1
getting 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
outrageous 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
around 1
two 1
sides 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
he 1
disappears 1
down 1
cellar 1
Then 1
in 1
about 1
two 1
seconds 1
we 1
heard 1
a 1
whack 1
and 1
the 1
dog 1
he 1
finished 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
most 1
amazing 1
howl 1
or 1
two 1
and 1
then 1
everything 1
was 1
dead 1
still 1
and 1
the 1
parson 1
begun 1
his 1
solemn 1
talk 1
where 1
he 1
left 1
off 1
In 1
a 1
minute 1
or 1
two 1
here 1
comes 1
this 1
undertaker 1
s 1
back 1
and 1
shoulders 1
gliding 1
along 1
the 1
wall 1
again 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
glided 1
and 1
glided 1
around 1
three 1
sides 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
then 1
rose 1
up 1
and 1
shaded 1
his 1
mouth 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
stretched 1
his 1
neck 1
out 1
towards 1
the 1
preacher 1
over 1
the 1
people 1
s 1
heads 1
and 1
says 1
in 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
coarse 1
whisper 1
He 1
had 1
a 1
rat 1
Then 1
he 1
drooped 1
down 1
and 1
glided 1
along 1
the 1
wall 1
again 1
to 1
his 1
place 1
You 1
could 1
see 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
satisfaction 1
to 1
the 1
people 1
because 1
naturally 1
they 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
A 1
little 1
thing 1
like 1
that 1
don 1
t 1
cost 1
nothing 1
and 1
it 1
s 1
just 1
the 1
little 1
things 1
that 1
makes 1
a 1
man 1
to 1
be 1
looked 1
up 1
to 1
and 1
liked 1
There 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
more 1
popular 1
man 1
in 1
town 1
than 1
what 1
that 1
undertaker 1
was 1
Well 1
the 1
funeral 1
sermon 1
was 1
very 1
good 1
but 1
pison 1
long 1
and 1
tiresome 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
king 1
he 1
shoved 1
in 1
and 1
got 1
off 1
some 1
of 1
his 1
usual 1
rubbage 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
job 1
was 1
through 1
and 1
the 1
undertaker 1
begun 1
to 1
sneak 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
coffin 1
with 1
his 1
screw 1
driver 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
sweat 1
then 1
and 1
watched 1
him 1
pretty 1
keen 1
But 1
he 1
never 1
meddled 1
at 1
all 1
just 1
slid 1
the 1
lid 1
along 1
as 1
soft 1
as 1
mush 1
and 1
screwed 1
it 1
down 1
tight 1
and 1
fast 1
So 1
there 1
I 1
was 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
whether 1
the 1
money 1
was 1
in 1
there 1
or 1
not 1
So 1
says 1
I 1
s 1
pose 1
somebody 1
has 1
hogged 1
that 1
bag 1
on 1
the 1
sly 1
now 1
how 1
do 1
I 1
know 1
whether 1
to 1
write 1
to 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
or 1
not 1
S 1
pose 1
she 1
dug 1
him 1
up 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
find 1
nothing 1
what 1
would 1
she 1
think 1
of 1
me 1
Blame 1
it 1
I 1
says 1
I 1
might 1
get 1
hunted 1
up 1
and 1
jailed 1
I 1
d 1
better 1
lay 1
low 1
and 1
keep 1
dark 1
and 1
not 1
write 1
at 1
all 1
the 1
thing 1
s 1
awful 1
mixed 1
now 1
trying 1
to 1
better 1
it 1
I 1
ve 1
worsened 1
it 1
a 1
hundred 1
times 1
and 1
I 1
wish 1
to 1
goodness 1
I 1
d 1
just 1
let 1
it 1
alone 1
dad 1
fetch 1
the 1
whole 1
business 1
They 1
buried 1
him 1
and 1
we 1
come 1
back 1
home 1
and 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
watching 1
faces 1
again 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
help 1
it 1
and 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
rest 1
easy 1
But 1
nothing 1
come 1
of 1
it 1
the 1
faces 1
didn 1
t 1
tell 1
me 1
nothing 1
The 1
king 1
he 1
visited 1
around 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
and 1
sweetened 1
everybody 1
up 1
and 1
made 1
himself 1
ever 1
so 1
friendly 1
and 1
he 1
give 1
out 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
his 1
congregation 1
over 1
in 1
England 1
would 1
be 1
in 1
a 1
sweat 1
about 1
him 1
so 1
he 1
must 1
hurry 1
and 1
settle 1
up 1
the 1
estate 1
right 1
away 1
and 1
leave 1
for 1
home 1
He 1
was 1
very 1
sorry 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
pushed 1
and 1
so 1
was 1
everybody 1
they 1
wished 1
he 1
could 1
stay 1
longer 1
but 1
they 1
said 1
they 1
could 1
see 1
it 1
couldn 1
t 1
be 1
done 1
And 1
he 1
said 1
of 1
course 1
him 1
and 1
William 1
would 1
take 1
the 1
girls 1
home 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
that 1
pleased 1
everybody 1
too 1
because 1
then 1
the 1
girls 1
would 1
be 1
well 1
fixed 1
and 1
amongst 1
their 1
own 1
relations 1
and 1
it 1
pleased 1
the 1
girls 1
too 1
tickled 1
them 1
so 1
they 1
clean 1
forgot 1
they 1
ever 1
had 1
a 1
trouble 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
to 1
sell 1
out 1
as 1
quick 1
as 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
ready 1
Them 1
poor 1
things 1
was 1
that 1
glad 1
and 1
happy 1
it 1
made 1
my 1
heart 1
ache 1
to 1
see 1
them 1
getting 1
fooled 1
and 1
lied 1
to 1
so 1
but 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
see 1
no 1
safe 1
way 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
chip 1
in 1
and 1
change 1
the 1
general 1
tune 1
Well 1
blamed 1
if 1
the 1
king 1
didn 1
t 1
bill 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
the 1
niggers 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
property 1
for 1
auction 1
straight 1
off 1
sale 1
two 1
days 1
after 1
the 1
funeral 1
but 1
anybody 1
could 1
buy 1
private 1
beforehand 1
if 1
they 1
wanted 1
to 1
So 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
after 1
the 1
funeral 1
along 1
about 1
noon 1
time 1
the 1
girls 1
joy 1
got 1
the 1
first 1
jolt 1
A 1
couple 1
of 1
nigger 1
traders 1
come 1
along 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
sold 1
them 1
the 1
niggers 1
reasonable 1
for 1
three 1
day 1
drafts 1
as 1
they 1
called 1
it 1
and 1
away 1
they 1
went 1
the 1
two 1
sons 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
to 1
Memphis 1
and 1
their 1
mother 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
to 1
Orleans 1
I 1
thought 1
them 1
poor 1
girls 1
and 1
them 1
niggers 1
would 1
break 1
their 1
hearts 1
for 1
grief 1
they 1
cried 1
around 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
took 1
on 1
so 1
it 1
most 1
made 1
me 1
down 1
sick 1
to 1
see 1
it 1
The 1
girls 1
said 1
they 1
hadn 1
t 1
ever 1
dreamed 1
of 1
seeing 1
the 1
family 1
separated 1
or 1
sold 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
town 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
ever 1
get 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
memory 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
them 1
poor 1
miserable 1
girls 1
and 1
niggers 1
hanging 1
around 1
each 1
other 1
s 1
necks 1
and 1
crying 1
and 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
a 1
stood 1
it 1
all 1
but 1
would 1
a 1
had 1
to 1
bust 1
out 1
and 1
tell 1
on 1
our 1
gang 1
if 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
knowed 1
the 1
sale 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
account 1
and 1
the 1
niggers 1
would 1
be 1
back 1
home 1
in 1
a 1
week 1
or 1
two 1
The 1
thing 1
made 1
a 1
big 1
stir 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
too 1
and 1
a 1
good 1
many 1
come 1
out 1
flatfooted 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
scandalous 1
to 1
separate 1
the 1
mother 1
and 1
the 1
children 1
that 1
way 1
It 1
injured 1
the 1
frauds 1
some 1
but 1
the 1
old 1
fool 1
he 1
bulled 1
right 1
along 1
spite 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
duke 1
could 1
say 1
or 1
do 1
and 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
the 1
duke 1
was 1
powerful 1
uneasy 1
Next 1
day 1
was 1
auction 1
day 1
About 1
broad 1
day 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
come 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
garret 1
and 1
woke 1
me 1
up 1
and 1
I 1
see 1
by 1
their 1
look 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
trouble 1
The 1
king 1
says 1
Was 1
you 1
in 1
my 1
room 1
night 1
before 1
last 1
No 1
your 1
majesty 1
which 1
was 1
the 1
way 1
I 1
always 1
called 1
him 1
when 1
nobody 1
but 1
our 1
gang 1
warn 1
t 1
around 1
Was 1
you 1
in 1
there 1
yisterday 1
er 1
last 1
night 1
No 1
your 1
majesty 1
Honor 1
bright 1
now 1
no 1
lies 1
Honor 1
bright 1
your 1
majesty 1
I 1
m 1
telling 1
you 1
the 1
truth 1
I 1
hain 1
t 1
been 1
a 1
near 1
your 1
room 1
since 1
Miss 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
took 1
you 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
and 1
showed 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
The 1
duke 1
says 1
Have 1
you 1
seen 1
anybody 1
else 1
go 1
in 1
there 1
No 1
your 1
grace 1
not 1
as 1
I 1
remember 1
I 1
believe 1
Stop 1
and 1
think 1
I 1
studied 1
awhile 1
and 1
see 1
my 1
chance 1
then 1
I 1
says 1
Well 1
I 1
see 1
the 1
niggers 1
go 1
in 1
there 1
several 1
times 1
Both 1
of 1
them 1
gave 1
a 1
little 1
jump 1
and 1
looked 1
like 1
they 1
hadn 1
t 1
ever 1
expected 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
like 1
they 1
had 1
Then 1
the 1
duke 1
says 1
What 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
No 1
leastways 1
not 1
all 1
at 1
once 1

think 1
I 1
ever 1

them 1
all 1
come 1
out 1
at 1
once 1
but 1
just 1
one 1
time 1
Hello 1
When 1
was 1
that 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
day 1
we 1
had 1
the 1
funeral 1
In 1
the 1
morning 1
It 1
warn 1
t 1
early 1
because 1
I 1
overslept 1
I 1
was 1
just 1
starting 1
down 1
the 1
ladder 1
and 1
I 1
see 1
them 1
Well 1

What 1
did 1
they 1
do 1
How 1
d 1

They 1
didn 1
t 1
do 1
nothing 1
And 1
they 1
didn 1
t 1
act 1
anyway 1
much 1
as 1
fur 1
as 1
I 1
see 1
They 1
tiptoed 1
away 1
so 1
I 1
seen 1

enough 1
that 1
they 1
d 1
shoved 1
in 1
there 1
to 1
do 1

so 1
they 1
was 1
hoping 1
to 1
slide 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
trouble 1
without 1
waking 1
you 1
up 1
if 1
they 1
hadn 1
t 1
already 1
waked 1

up 1
Great 1
guns 1

go 1
says 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
both 1
of 1
them 1
looked 1
pretty 1
sick 1
and 1
tolerable 1
silly 1
They 1

CHAPTER 1
XXVIII 1
BY 1
and 1
by 1
it 1
was 1
getting 1
up 1
time 1
So 1
I 1
come 1
down 1
the 1
ladder 1
and 1
started 1
for 1
down 1
stairs 1
but 1
as 1
I 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
girls 1
room 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
open 1
and 1
I 1
see 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
setting 1
by 1
her 1
old 1
hair 1
trunk 1
which 1
was 1
open 1
and 1
she 1
d 1
been 1
packing 1
things 1
in 1
it 1
getting 1
ready 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
England 1
But 1
she 1
had 1
stopped 1
now 1
with 1
a 1
folded 1
gown 1
in 1
her 1
lap 1
and 1
had 1
her 1
face 1
in 1
her 1
hands 1
crying 1
I 1
felt 1
awful 1
bad 1
to 1
see 1
it 1
of 1
course 1
anybody 1
would 1
I 1
went 1
in 1
there 1
and 1
says 1
Miss 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
you 1
can 1
t 1
a 1
bear 1
to 1
see 1
people 1
in 1
trouble 1
and 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
most 1
always 1
Tell 1
me 1
about 1
it 1
So 1
she 1
done 1
it 1
And 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
niggers 1
I 1
just 1
expected 1
it 1
She 1
said 1
the 1
beautiful 1
trip 1
to 1
England 1
was 1
most 1
about 1
spoiled 1
for 1
her 1
she 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
how 1
she 1
was 1
ever 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
happy 1
there 1
knowing 1
the 1
mother 1
and 1
the 1
children 1
warn 1
t 1
ever 1
going 1
to 1
see 1
each 1
other 1
no 1
more 1
and 1
then 1
busted 1
out 1
bitterer 1
than 1
ever 1
and 1
flung 1
up 1
her 1
hands 1
and 1
says 1
Oh 1
dear 2
to 1
think 1
they 1
ain 1
t 1
ever 1
going 1
to 1
see 1
each 1
other 1
any 1
more 1
But 1
they 1
will 1
and 1
inside 1
of 1
two 1
weeks 1
and 1
I 1
know 1
it 1
says 1
I 1
Laws 1
it 1
was 1
out 1
before 1
I 1
could 1
think 1
And 1
before 1
I 1
could 1
budge 1
she 1
throws 1
her 1
arms 1
around 1
my 1
neck 1
and 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
say 1
it 1
again 1
say 1
it 1
again 1
say 1
it 1
again 1
I 1
see 1
I 1
had 1
spoke 1
too 1
sudden 1
and 1
said 1
too 1
much 1
and 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
close 1
place 1
I 1
asked 1
her 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
think 1
a 1
minute 1
and 1
she 1
set 1
there 1
very 1
impatient 1
and 1
excited 1
and 1
handsome 1
but 1
looking 1
kind 1
of 1
happy 1
and 1
eased 1
up 1
like 1
a 1
person 1
that 1
s 1
had 1
a 1
tooth 1
pulled 1
out 1
So 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
studying 1
it 1
out 1
I 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
I 1
reckon 1
a 1
body 1
that 1
ups 1
and 1
tells 1
the 1
truth 1
when 1
he 1
is 1
in 1
a 1
tight 1
place 1
is 1
taking 1
considerable 1
many 1
resks 1
though 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
had 1
no 1
experience 1
and 1
can 1
t 1
say 1
for 1
certain 1
but 1
it 1
looks 1
so 1
to 1
me 1
anyway 1
and 1
yet 1
here 1
s 1
a 1
case 1
where 1
I 1
m 1
blest 1
if 1
it 1
don 1
t 1
look 1
to 1
me 1
like 1
the 1
truth 1
is 1
better 1
and 1
actuly 1
safer 1
than 1
a 1
lie 1
I 1
must 1
lay 1
it 1
by 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
think 1
it 1
over 1
some 1
time 1
or 1
other 1
it 1
s 1
so 1
kind 1
of 1
strange 1
and 1
unregular 1
I 1
never 1
see 1
nothing 1
like 1
it 1
Well 1
I 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
at 1
last 1
I 1
m 1
a 1
going 1
to 1
chance 1
it 1
I 1
ll 1
up 1
and 1
tell 1
the 1
truth 1
this 1
time 1
though 1
it 1
does 1
seem 1
most 1
like 1
setting 1
down 1
on 1
a 1
kag 1
of 1
powder 1
and 1
touching 1
it 1
off 1
just 1
to 1
see 1
where 1
you 1
ll 1
go 1
to 1
Then 1
I 1
says 1
Miss 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
is 1
there 1
any 1
place 1
out 1
of 1
town 1
a 1
little 1
ways 1
where 1

go 1
and 1
stay 1

or 1
four 1
days 1
Yes 1
Mr 1
Lothrop 1

Why 1
Never 1
mind 1

If 1

you 1
how 1
I 1
know 1
the 1
niggers 1

see 1
each 1
other 1
again 1
inside 1
of 1
two 1
weeks 1

house 1

it 1
will 1
you 1
go 1
to 1
Mr 1
Lothrop 1

and 1

days 1
Four 1
days 1

says 1

year 1
All 1

says 1

it 1
than 1

kiss 1
the 1
Bible 1
She 1
smiled 1
and 1
reddened 1
up 1
very 1
sweet 1
and 1
I 1
says 1
If 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
mind 1
it 1
I 1
ll 1
shut 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
bolt 1
it 1
Then 1
I 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
set 1
down 1
again 1
and 1
says 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
holler 1
Just 1
set 1
still 1
and 1
take 1
it 1
like 1
a 1
man 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
tell 1
the 1
truth 1
and 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
brace 1
up 1
Miss 1
Mary 1
because 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
bad 1
kind 1
and 1
going 1
to 1

hard 1
to 1

These 1

There 1

the 1
worst 1
of 1
it 1

middling 1
easy 1
It 1
jolted 1
her 1
up 1
like 1
everything 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
over 1
the 1
shoal 1
water 1
now 1
so 1
I 1
went 1
right 1
along 1
her 1
eyes 1
a 1
blazing 1
higher 1
and 1
higher 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
every 1
blame 1
thing 1
from 1
where 1
we 1
first 1
struck 1
that 1
young 1
fool 1
going 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
steamboat 1
clear 1
through 1
to 1
where 1
she 1
flung 1
herself 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
breast 1
at 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
and 1
he 1
kissed 1
her 1
sixteen 1
or 1
seventeen 1
times 1
and 1
then 1
up 1
she 1
jumps 1
with 1
her 1
face 1
afire 1
like 1
sunset 1
and 1
says 1
The 1
brute 1
Come 1

a 1
minute 1
not 1
a 1
second 1
we 1
ll 1

Says 1

But 1

Oh 1

Saying 1

Why 1

A 1

get 1
a 1
little 1
rest 1
and 1
change 1
or 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
friend 1
and 1
you 1
ll 1
be 1
back 1
to 1

or 1

in 1

morning 1
Gone 1

all 1
right 1
but 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
have 1
my 1
love 1
given 1
to 1
them 1
Well 1
then 1
it 1
sha 1
n 1
t 1
be 1
It 1
was 1
well 1
enough 1
to 1
tell 1
her 1
so 1
no 1
harm 1
in 1
it 1
It 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
little 1
thing 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
no 1
trouble 1
and 1
it 1
s 1
the 1
little 1
things 1
that 1
smooths 1
people 1

most 1
down 1

Then 1

more 1
thing 1
that 1
bag 1
of 1
money 1
Well 1
they 1
ve 1
got 1
that 1
and 1
it 1
makes 1
me 1
feel 1
pretty 1
silly 1
to 1
think 1
how 1
they 1
got 1
it 1
No 1
you 1
re 1
out 1
there 1
They 1

t 1
I 1
had 1
it 1
because 1
I 1
stole 1
it 1
from 1
them 1
and 1
I 1
stole 1
it 1
to 1
give 1
to 1
you 1
and 1
I 1
know 1
where 1
I 1
hid 1
it 1
but 1
I 1
m 1
afraid 1

ain 1
t 1
there 1
no 1
more 1
I 1
m 1
awful 1
sorry 1
Miss 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
I 1
m 1
just 1
as 1
sorry 1
as 1
I 1
can 1
be 1
but 1
I 1
done 1
the 1
best 1
I 1
could 1
I 1
did 1
honest 1
I 1
come 1
nigh 1
getting 1
caught 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
shove 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
first 1
place 1
I 1
come 1
to 1
and 1
run 1
and 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
a 1
good 1
place 1
Oh 1
stop 1
blaming 1
yourself 1
it 1
s 1
too 1
bad 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
and 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
allow 1
it 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
help 1
it 2
wasn 1
t 1
your 1
fault 1
Where 1
did 1
you 1
hide 1
it 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
set 1
her 1
to 1
thinking 1
about 1
her 1
troubles 1
again 1
and 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
get 1
my 1
mouth 1
to 1
tell 1
her 1
what 1
would 1
make 1
her 1
see 1
that 1
corpse 1
laying 1
in 1
the 1
coffin 1
with 1
that 1
bag 1
of 1
money 1
on 1
his 1
stomach 1
So 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
say 1
nothing 1
then 1
I 1
says 1
I 1
d 1
ruther 1
not 1
tell 1
you 1
where 1
I 1
put 1
it 1
Miss 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
if 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
mind 1
letting 1
me 1
off 1
but 1
I 1
ll 1
write 1
it 1
for 1
you 1
on 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
paper 1
and 1
you 1
can 1
read 1
it 1
along 1
the 1
road 1
to 1
Mr 1
Lothrop 1
s 1
if 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
Do 1
you 1
reckon 1
that 1
ll 1
do 1
Oh 1
yes 1
So 1
I 1
wrote 1
I 1
put 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
coffin 1
It 1
was 1
in 1
there 1
when 1
you 1
was 1
crying 1
there 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
I 1
was 1
behind 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
mighty 1
sorry 1
for 1
you 1
Miss 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
It 1
made 1
my 1
eyes 1
water 1
a 1
little 1
to 1
remember 1
her 1
crying 1
there 1
all 1
by 1
herself 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
and 1
them 1
devils 1
laying 1
there 1
right 1
under 1
her 1
own 1
roof 1
shaming 1
her 1
and 1
robbing 1
her 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
folded 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
give 1
it 1
to 1
her 1
I 1
see 1
the 1
water 1
come 1
into 1
her 1
eyes 1
too 1
and 1
she 1
shook 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
hard 1
and 1
says 1
Good 1
bye 1
I 1
m 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
everything 1
just 1
as 1
you 1
ve 1
told 1
me 1
and 1
if 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
ever 1
see 1
you 1
again 1
I 1
sha 1
n 1
t 1
ever 1
forget 1
you 1
and 1
I 1
ll 1
think 1
of 1
you 1
a 1
many 1
and 1
a 1
many 1
a 1
time 1
and 1
I 1
ll 1
pray 1
for 1
you 1
too 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
gone 1
Pray 1
for 1
me 1
I 1
reckoned 1
if 1
she 1
knowed 1
me 1
she 1
d 1
take 1
a 1
job 1
that 1
was 1
more 1
nearer 1
her 1
size 1
But 1
I 1
bet 1
she 1
done 1
it 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
she 1
was 1
just 1
that 1
kind 1
She 1
had 1
the 1
grit 1
to 1
pray 1
for 1
Judus 1
if 1
she 1
took 1
the 1
notion 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
back 1
down 1
to 1
her 1
I 1
judge 1
You 1
may 1
say 1
what 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
but 1
in 1
my 1
opinion 1
she 1
had 1
more 1
sand 1
in 1
her 1
than 1
any 1
girl 1
I 1
ever 1
see 1
in 1
my 1
opinion 1
she 1
was 1
just 1
full 1
of 1
sand 1
It 1
sounds 1
like 1
flattery 1
but 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
flattery 1
And 1
when 1
it 1
comes 1
to 1
beauty 1
and 1
goodness 1
too 1
she 1
lays 1
over 1
them 1
all 1
I 1
hain 1
t 1
ever 1
seen 1
her 1
since 1
that 1
time 1
that 1
I 1
see 1
her 1
go 1
out 1
of 1
that 1
door 1
no 1
I 1
hain 1
t 1
ever 1
seen 1
her 1
since 1
but 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
ve 1
thought 1
of 1
her 1
a 1
many 1
and 1
a 1
many 1
a 1
million 1
times 1
and 1
of 1
her 1
saying 1
she 1
would 1
pray 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
if 1
ever 1
I 1
d 1
a 1
thought 1
it 1
would 1
do 1
any 1
good 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
pray 1
for 1
her 1
blamed 1
if 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
a 1
done 1
it 1
or 1
bust 1
Well 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
she 1
lit 1
out 1
the 1
back 1
way 1
I 1
reckon 1
because 1
nobody 1
see 1
her 1
go 1
When 1
I 1
struck 1
Susan 1
and 1
the 1
hare 1
lip 1

Why 1

pity 1
but 1
my 1
church 1
matters 1

got 1
to 1
get 1
along 1
the 1
best 1
way 1
they 1
can 1
for 1
my 1
niece 1
has 1
been 1
exposed 1
to 1
the 1
dreadful 1
pluribus 1
unum 1
mumps 1
and 1
so 1
it 1
s 1
my 1
bounden 1
duty 1
to 1
set 1
down 1
here 1
and 1
wait 1
the 1
three 1
months 1
it 1
takes 1
to 1
show 1
on 1
her 1
if 1
she 1
s 1
got 1
it 1
But 1
never 1
mind 1
if 1
you 1
think 1
it 1
s 1
best 1
to 1
tell 1
your 1
uncle 1
Harvey 1
Shucks 1
and 1
stay 1
fooling 1
around 1
here 1
when 1
we 1
could 1
all 1
be 1
having 1
good 1
times 1
in 1
England 1
whilst 1
we 1
was 1
waiting 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
whether 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
s 1
got 1
it 1
or 1
not 1
Why 1
you 1
talk 1
like 1
a 1
muggins 1
Well 1
anyway 1
maybe 1
you 1
d 1
better 1
tell 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
neighbors 1
Listen 1
at 1
that 1
now 1
You 1
do 1
beat 1
all 1
for 1
natural 1
stupidness 1
Can 1
t 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
they 1
d 1
go 1
and 1
tell 1
Ther 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
way 1
but 1
just 1
to 1
not 1
tell 1
anybody 1
at 1
all 1
Well 1
maybe 1
you 1
re 1
right 1
yes 1
I 1
judge 1
you 1
are 1
right 1
But 1
I 1
reckon 1
we 1
ought 1
to 1
tell 1
Uncle 1
Harvey 1
she 1
s 1
gone 1
out 1
a 1
while 1
anyway 1
so 1
he 1
won 1
t 1
be 1
uneasy 1
about 1
her 1
Yes 1
Miss 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
she 1
wanted 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
She 1
says 1
Tell 1
them 1
to 1
give 1
Uncle 1
Harvey 1
and 1
William 1
my 1
love 1
and 1
a 1
kiss 1
and 1
say 1
I 1
ve 1
run 1
over 1
the 1
river 1
to 1
see 1
Mr 2
what 1
is 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
that 1
rich 1
family 1
your 1
uncle 1
Peter 1
used 1
to 1
think 1
so 1
much 1
of 1
I 1
mean 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
Why 1
you 1
must 1
mean 1
the 1
Apthorps 1
ain 1
t 1
it 1
Of 1
course 1
bother 1
them 1
kind 1
of 1
names 1
a 1
body 1
can 1
t 1
ever 1
seem 1
to 1
remember 1
them 1
half 1
the 1
time 1
somehow 1
Yes 1
she 1
said 1
say 1
she 1
has 1
run 1
over 1
for 1
to 1
ask 1
the 1
Apthorps 1
to 1
be 1
sure 1
and 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
auction 1
and 1
buy 1
this 1
house 1
because 1
she 1
allowed 1
her 1
uncle 1
Peter 1
would 1
ruther 1
they 1
had 1
it 1
than 1
anybody 1
else 1
and 1
she 1
s 1
going 1
to 1
stick 1
to 1
them 1
till 1
they 1
say 1
they 1
ll 1
come 1
and 1
then 1
if 1
she 1
ain 1
t 1
too 1
tired 1
she 1
s 1
coming 1
home 1
and 1
if 1
she 1
is 1
she 1
ll 1
be 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
anyway 1
She 1
said 1
don 1
t 1
say 1
nothing 1
about 1
the 1
Proctors 1
but 1
only 1
about 1
the 1
Apthorps 1
which 1
ll 1
be 1
perfectly 1
true 1
because 1
she 1
is 1
going 1
there 1
to 1
speak 1
about 1
their 1
buying 1
the 1
house 1
I 1
know 1
it 1
because 1
she 1
told 1
me 1
so 1
herself 1
All 1
right 1
they 1
said 1
and 1
cleared 1
out 1
to 1
lay 1
for 1
their 1
uncles 1
and 1
give 1
them 1
the 1
love 1
and 1
the 1
kisses 1
and 1
tell 1
them 1
the 1
message 1
Everything 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
now 1
The 1
girls 1
wouldn 1
t 1
say 1
nothing 1
because 1
they 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
England 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
would 1
ruther 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
was 1
off 1
working 1
for 1
the 1
auction 1
than 1
around 1
in 1
reach 1
of 1
Doctor 1
Robinson 1
I 1
felt 1
very 1
good 1
I 1
judged 1
I 1
had 1
done 1
it 1
pretty 1
neat 1
I 1
reckoned 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
couldn 1
t 1
a 1
done 1
it 1
no 1
neater 1
himself 1
Of 1
course 1
he 1
would 1
a 1
throwed 1
more 1
style 1
into 1
it 1
but 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
do 1
that 1
very 1
handy 1
not 1
being 1
brung 1
up 1
to 1
it 1
Well 1
they 1
held 1
the 1
auction 1
in 1
the 1
public 1
square 1
along 1
towards 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
afternoon 1
and 1
it 1
strung 1
along 1
and 1
strung 1
along 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
he 1
was 1
on 1
hand 1
and 1
looking 1
his 1
level 1
pisonest 1
up 1
there 1
longside 1
of 1
the 1
auctioneer 1
and 1
chipping 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
Scripture 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
or 1
a 1
little 1
goody 2
saying 1
of 1
some 1
kind 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
he 1
was 1
around 1
goo 1
gooing 1
for 1
sympathy 1
all 1
he 1
knowed 1
how 1
and 1
just 1
spreading 1
himself 1
generly 1
But 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
thing 1
dragged 1
through 1
and 1
everything 1
was 1
sold 1
everything 1
but 1
a 1
little 1
old 1
trifling 1
lot 1
in 1
the 1
graveyard 1
So 1
they 1
d 1
got 1
to 1
work 1
that 1
off 1
I 1
never 1
see 1
such 1
a 1
girafft 1
as 1
the 1
king 1
was 1
for 1
wanting 1
to 1
swallow 1
everything 1
Well 1
whilst 1
they 1
was 1
at 1
it 1
a 1
steamboat 1
landed 1
and 1
in 1
about 1
two 1
minutes 1
up 1
comes 1
a 1
crowd 1
a 1
whooping 1
and 1
yelling 1
and 1
laughing 1
and 1
carrying 1
on 1
and 1
singing 1
out 1
Here 1

CHAPTER 1
XXIX 1
THEY 1
was 1
fetching 1
a 1
very 1
nice 1
looking 1
old 1
gentleman 1
along 1
and 1
a 1
nice 1
looking 1
younger 1
one 1
with 1
his 1
right 1
arm 1
in 1
a 1
sling 1
And 1
my 1
souls 1
how 1
the 1
people 1
yelled 1
and 1
laughed 1
and 1
kept 1
it 1
up 1
But 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
see 1
no 1
joke 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
I 1
judged 1
it 1
would 1
strain 1
the 1
duke 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
some 1
to 1
see 1
any 1
I 1
reckoned 1
they 1
d 1
turn 1
pale 1
But 1
no 1
nary 1
a 1
pale 1
did 1
they 1
turn 1
The 1
duke 1
he 1
never 1
let 1
on 1
he 1
suspicioned 1
what 1
was 1
up 1
but 1
just 1
went 1
a 1
goo 1
gooing 1
around 1
happy 1
and 1
satisfied 1
like 1
a 1
jug 1
that 1
s 1
googling 1
out 1
buttermilk 1
and 1
as 1
for 1
the 1
king 1
he 1
just 1
gazed 1
and 1
gazed 1
down 1
sorrowful 1
on 1
them 1
new 1
comers 1
like 1
it 1
give 1
him 1
the 1
stomach 1
ache 1
in 1
his 1
very 1
heart 1
to 1
think 1
there 1
could 1
be 1
such 1
frauds 1
and 1
rascals 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
Oh 1
he 1
done 1
it 1
admirable 1
Lots 1
of 1
the 1
principal 1
people 1
gethered 1
around 1
the 1
king 1
to 1
let 1
him 1
see 1
they 1
was 1
on 1
his 1
side 1
That 1
old 1
gentleman 1
that 1
had 1
just 1
come 1
looked 1
all 1
puzzled 1
to 1
death 1
Pretty 1
soon 1
he 1
begun 1
to 1
speak 1
and 1
I 1
see 1
straight 1
off 1
he 1
pronounced 1
like 1
an 1
Englishman 1
not 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
way 1
though 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
was 1
pretty 1
good 1
for 1
an 1
imitation 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
give 1
the 1
old 1
gent 1
s 1
words 1
nor 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
imitate 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
turned 1
around 1
to 1
the 1
crowd 1
and 1
says 1
about 1
like 1
this 1
This 1
is 1
a 1
surprise 1
to 1
me 1
which 1
I 1
wasn 1
t 1
looking 1
for 1
and 1
I 1
ll 1
acknowledge 1
candid 1
and 1
frank 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
very 1
well 1
fixed 1
to 1
meet 1
it 1
and 1
answer 1
it 1
for 1
my 1
brother 1
and 1
me 1
has 1
had 1
misfortunes 1
he 1
s 1
broke 1
his 1
arm 1
and 1
our 1
baggage 1
got 1
put 1
off 1
at 1
a 1
town 1
above 1
here 1
last 1
night 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
by 1
a 1
mistake 1
I 1
am 1
Peter 1
Wilks 1
brother 1
Harvey 1
and 1
this 1
is 1
his 1
brother 1
William 1
which 1
can 1
t 1
hear 1
nor 1
speak 1
and 1
can 1
t 1
even 1
make 1
signs 1
to 1
amount 1
to 1
much 1
now 1
t 1
he 1
s 1
only 1
got 1
one 1
hand 1
to 1
work 1
them 1
with 1
We 1
are 1
who 1
we 1
say 1
we 1
are 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
day 1
or 1
two 1
when 1
I 1
get 1
the 1
baggage 1
I 1
can 1
prove 1
it 1
But 1
up 1
till 1
then 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
say 1
nothing 1
more 1
but 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
hotel 1
and 1
wait 1
So 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
new 1
dummy 1
started 1
off 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
he 1
laughs 1
and 1
blethers 1
out 1
Broke 1
his 1
arm 1
very 1
likely 1
ain 1
t 1
it 1
and 1
very 1
convenient 1
too 1
for 1
a 1
fraud 1
that 1
s 1
got 1
to 1
make 1
signs 1
and 1
ain 1
t 1
learnt 1
how 1
Lost 1
their 1
baggage 1
That 1
s 1
mighty 1
good 1
and 1
mighty 1
ingenious 1
under 1
the 1
circumstances 1
So 1
he 1
laughed 1
again 1
and 1
so 1
did 1
everybody 1
else 1
except 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
or 1
maybe 1
half 1
a 1
dozen 1
One 1
of 1
these 1
was 1
that 1
doctor 1
another 1
one 1
was 1
a 1
sharp 1
looking 1
gentleman 1
with 1
a 1
carpet 1
bag 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
fashioned 1
kind 1
made 1
out 1
of 1
carpet 1
stuff 1
that 1
had 1
just 1
come 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
steamboat 1
and 1
was 1
talking 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
voice 1
and 1
glancing 1
towards 1
the 1
king 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
and 1
nodding 1
their 1
heads 1
it 1
was 1
Levi 1
Bell 1
the 1
lawyer 1
that 1
was 1
gone 1
up 1
to 1
Louisville 1
and 1
another 1
one 1
was 1
a 1
big 1
rough 1
husky 1
that 1
come 1
along 1
and 1
listened 1
to 1
all 1
the 1
old 1
gentleman 1
said 1
and 1
was 1
listening 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
now 1
And 1
when 1
the 1
king 1
got 1
done 1
this 1
husky 1
up 1
and 1
says 1
Say 1
looky 1
here 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
Harvey 1
Wilks 1
when 1
d 1
you 1
come 1
to 1

Several 1

not 1

way 1
to 1
an 1
old 1
man 1
and 1
a 1
preacher 1
Preacher 1
be 1
hanged 1
he 1
s 1
a 1
fraud 1
and 1
a 1
liar 1
He 1
was 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
Pint 1
that 1
mornin 1
I 1
live 1

I 1
Well 1
I 1
was 1
up 1
there 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
up 1
there 1
I 1
see 1
him 1
there 1
He 1
come 1
in 1
a 1
canoe 1
along 1
with 1
Tim 1
Collins 1
and 1
a 1
boy 1
The 1
doctor 1
he 1
up 1
and 1
says 1
Would 1
you 1
know 1
the 1
boy 1
again 1
if 1
you 1
was 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
Hines 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
would 1
but 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
Why 1
yonder 1
he 1
is 1
now 1
I 1
know 1
him 1
perfectly 1
easy 1
It 1
was 1
me 1
he 1
pointed 1
at 1
The 1
doctor 1
says 1
Neighbors 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
whether 1
the 1
new 1
couple 1
is 1
frauds 1
or 1
not 1
but 1
if 1
these 1
two 1
ain 1
t 1
frauds 1
I 1
am 1
an 1
idiot 1
that 1
s 1
all 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
s 1
our 1
duty 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
get 1
away 1
from 1
here 1
till 1
we 1
ve 1
looked 1
into 1
this 1
thing 1
Come 1
along 1
Hines 1
come 1
along 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
you 1
We 1
ll 1
take 1
these 1
fellows 1
to 1
the 1
tavern 1
and 1
affront 1
them 1
with 1
t 1
other 1
couple 1
and 1
I 1
reckon 1
we 1
ll 1
find 1
out 1
something 1
before 1
we 1
get 1
through 1
It 1
was 1
nuts 1
for 1
the 1
crowd 1
though 1
maybe 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
king 1
s 1
friends 1
so 1
we 1
all 1
started 1
It 1
was 1
about 1
sundown 1
The 1
doctor 1
he 1
led 1
me 1
along 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
was 1
plenty 1
kind 1
enough 1
but 1
he 1
never 1
let 1
go 1
my 1
hand 1
We 1
all 1
got 1
in 1
a 1
big 1
room 1
in 1
the 1
hotel 1
and 1
lit 1
up 1
some 1
candles 1
and 1
fetched 1
in 1
the 1
new 1
couple 1
First 1
the 1
doctor 1
says 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
too 1
hard 1
on 1
these 1
two 1
men 1
but 1
I 1
think 1
they 1
re 1
frauds 1
and 1
they 1
may 1
have 1
complices 1
that 1
we 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
nothing 1
about 1
If 1
they 1
have 1
won 1
t 1
the 1
complices 1
get 1
away 1
with 1
that 1
bag 1
of 1
gold 1
Peter 1
Wilks 1
left 1
It 1
ain 1
t 1
unlikely 1
If 1
these 1
men 1
ain 1
t 1
frauds 1
they 1
won 1
t 1
object 1
to 1
sending 1
for 1
that 1
money 1
and 1
letting 1
us 1
keep 1
it 1
till 1
they 1
prove 1
they 1
re 1
all 1
right 1
ain 1
t 1
that 1
so 1
Everybody 1
agreed 1
to 1
that 1
So 1
I 1
judged 1
they 1
had 1
our 1
gang 1
in 1
a 1
pretty 1
tight 1
place 1
right 1
at 1
the 1
outstart 1
But 1
the 1
king 1
he 1
only 1
looked 1
sorrowful 1
and 1
says 1
Gentlemen 1
I 1
wish 1
the 1
money 1
was 1
there 1
for 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
got 1
no 1
disposition 1
to 1
throw 1
anything 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
a 1
fair 1
open 1
out 1
and 1
out 1
investigation 1
o 1
this 1
misable 1
business 1
but 1
alas 1
the 1
money 1
ain 1
t 1
there 1
you 1
k 1
n 1
send 1
and 1
see 1
if 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
Where 1
is 1
it 1
then 1
Well 1
when 1
my 1
niece 1
give 1
it 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
keep 1
for 1
her 1
I 1
took 1
and 1
hid 1
it 1
inside 1
o 1
the 1
straw 1
tick 1
o 1
my 1
bed 1
not 1
wishin 1
to 1
bank 1
it 1
for 1
the 1
few 1
days 1
we 1
d 1

here 1
and 1
considerin 1
the 1
bed 1
a 1
safe 1
place 1
we 1
not 1

used 1
to 1
niggers 1
and 1
suppos 1
n 1
em 1
honest 1
like 1
servants 1
in 1
England 1
The 1
niggers 1
stole 1
it 1
the 1
very 1
next 1
mornin 1
after 1
I 1
had 1
went 1
down 1
stairs 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
sold 1
em 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
missed 1
the 1
money 1
yit 1
so 1
they 1
got 1
clean 1
away 1
with 1
it 1
My 1
servant 1
here 1
k 1
n 1
tell 1
you 1
bout 1
it 1
gentlemen 1
The 1
doctor 1
and 1
several 1
said 1
Shucks 1
and 1
I 1
see 1
nobody 1
didn 1
t 1
altogether 1
believe 1
him 1
One 1
man 1
asked 1
me 1
if 1
I 1
see 1
the 1
niggers 1
steal 1
it 1
I 1
said 1
no 1
but 1
I 1
see 1
them 1
sneaking 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
hustling 1
away 1
and 1
I 1
never 1
thought 1
nothing 1
only 1
I 1
reckoned 1
they 1
was 1
afraid 1
they 1
had 1
waked 1
up 1
my 1
master 1
and 1
was 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
before 1
he 1
made 1
trouble 1
with 1
them 1
That 1
was 1
all 1
they 1
asked 1
me 1
Then 1
the 1
doctor 1
whirls 1
on 1
me 1
and 1
says 1
Are 1
you 1
English 1
too 1
I 1
says 1
yes 1
and 1
him 1
and 1
some 1
others 1
laughed 1
and 1
said 1
Stuff 1
Well 1
then 1
they 1
sailed 1
in 1
on 1
the 1
general 1
investigation 1
and 1
there 1
we 1
had 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
hour 1
in 1
hour 1
out 1
and 1
nobody 1
never 1
said 1
a 1
word 1
about 1
supper 1
nor 1
ever 1
seemed 1
to 1
think 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
so 1
they 1
kept 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
kept 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
worst 1
mixed 1
up 1
thing 1
you 1
ever 1
see 1
They 1
made 1
the 1
king 1
tell 1
his 1
yarn 1
and 1
they 1
made 1
the 1
old 1
gentleman 1
tell 1
his 1
n 1
and 1
anybody 1
but 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
prejudiced 1
chuckleheads 1
would 1
a 1
seen 1
that 1
the 1
old 1
gentleman 1
was 1
spinning 1
truth 1
and 1
t 1
other 1
one 1
lies 1
And 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
they 1
had 1
me 1
up 1
to 1
tell 1
what 1
I 1
knowed 1
The 1
king 1
he 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
left 1
handed 1
look 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
his 1
eye 1
and 1
so 1
I 1
knowed 1
enough 1
to 1
talk 1
on 1
the 1
right 1
side 1
I 1
begun 1
to 1
tell 1
about 1
Sheffield 1
and 1
how 1
we 1
lived 1
there 1
and 1
all 1
about 1
the 1
English 1
Wilkses 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
but 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
get 1
pretty 1
fur 1
till 1
the 1
doctor 1
begun 1
to 1
laugh 1
and 1
Levi 1
Bell 1
the 1
lawyer 1
says 1
Set 1
down 1
my 1
boy 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
strain 1
myself 1
if 1
I 1
was 1
you 1
I 1
reckon 1
you 1
ain 1
t 1
used 1
to 1
lying 1
it 1
don 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
come 1
handy 1
what 1
you 1
want 1
is 1
practice 1
You 1
do 1
it 1
pretty 1
awkward 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
care 1
nothing 1
for 1
the 1
compliment 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
glad 1
to 1
be 1
let 1
off 1
anyway 1
The 1
doctor 1
he 1
started 1
to 1
say 1
something 1
and 1
turns 1
and 1
says 1
If 1
you 1
d 1
been 1
in 1
town 1
at 1
first 1
Levi 1
Bell 1
The 1
king 1
broke 1
in 1
and 1
reached 1
out 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
says 1
Why 1
is 1
this 1
my 1
poor 1
dead 1
brother 1
s 1
old 1
friend 1
that 1
he 1
s 1
wrote 1
so 1
often 1
about 1
The 1
lawyer 1
and 1
him 1
shook 1
hands 1
and 1
the 1
lawyer 1
smiled 1
and 1
looked 1
pleased 1
and 1
they 1
talked 1
right 1
along 1
awhile 1
and 1
then 1
got 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
talked 1
low 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
lawyer 1
speaks 1
up 1
and 1
says 1
That 1
ll 1
fix 1
it 1
I 1
ll 1
take 1
the 1
order 1
and 1
send 1
it 1
along 1
with 1
your 1
brother 1
s 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
ll 1
know 1
it 1
s 1
all 1
right 1
So 1
they 1
got 1
some 1
paper 1
and 1
a 1
pen 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
he 1
set 1
down 1
and 1
twisted 1
his 1
head 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
chawed 1
his 1
tongue 1
and 1
scrawled 1
off 1
something 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
give 1
the 1
pen 1
to 1
the 1
duke 1
and 1
then 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
the 1
duke 1
looked 1
sick 1
But 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
pen 1
and 1
wrote 1
So 1
then 1
the 1
lawyer 1
turns 1
to 1
the 1
new 1
old 1
gentleman 1
and 1
says 1
You 1
and 1
your 1
brother 1
please 1
write 1
a 1
line 1
or 1
two 1
and 1
sign 1
your 1
names 1
The 1
old 1
gentleman 1
wrote 1
but 1
nobody 1
couldn 1
t 1
read 1
it 1
The 1
lawyer 1
looked 1
powerful 1
astonished 1
and 1
says 1
Well 1
it 1
beats 1
me 1
and 1
snaked 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
old 1
letters 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
examined 1
them 1
and 1
then 1
examined 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
s 1
writing 1
and 1
then 1
them 1
again 1
and 1
then 1
says 1
These 1
old 1
letters 1
is 1
from 1
Harvey 1
Wilks 1
and 1
here 1
s 1
these 1
two 1
handwritings 1
and 1
anybody 1
can 1
see 1
they 1
didn 1
t 1
write 1
them 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
looked 1
sold 1
and 1
foolish 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
to 1
see 1
how 1
the 1
lawyer 1
had 1
took 1
them 1
in 1
and 1
here 1
s 1
this 1
old 1
gentleman 1
s 1
hand 1
writing 1
and 1
anybody 1
can 1
tell 1
easy 1
enough 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
write 1
them 1
fact 1
is 1
the 1
scratches 1
he 1
makes 1
ain 1
t 1
properly 1
writing 1
at 1
all 1
Now 1
here 1
s 1
some 1
letters 1
from 1
The 1
new 1
old 1
gentleman 1
says 1
If 1
you 1
please 1
let 1
me 1
explain 1
Nobody 1
can 1
read 1
my 1
hand 1
but 1
my 1
brother 1
there 1
so 1
he 1
copies 1
for 1
me 1
It 1
s 1
his 1
hand 1
you 1
ve 1
got 1
there 1
not 1
mine 1
Well 1
says 1
the 1
lawyer 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
things 1
I 1
ve 1
got 1
some 1
of 1
William 1
s 1
letters 1
too 1
so 1
if 1
you 1
ll 1
get 1
him 1
to 1
write 1
a 1
line 1
or 1
so 1
we 1
can 1
com 1
He 1
can 1
t 1
write 1
with 1
his 1
left 1
hand 1
says 1
the 1
old 1
gentleman 1
If 1
he 1
could 1
use 1
his 1
right 1
hand 1
you 1
would 1
see 1
that 1
he 1
wrote 1
his 1
own 1
letters 1
and 1
mine 1
too 1
Look 1
at 1
both 1
please 1
they 1
re 1
by 1
the 1
same 1
hand 1
The 1
lawyer 1
done 1
it 1
and 1
says 1
I 1
believe 1
it 1
s 1
so 1
and 1
if 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
so 1
there 1
s 1
a 1
heap 1
stronger 1
resemblance 1
than 1
I 1
d 1
noticed 1
before 1
anyway 1
Well 1
well 2
I 1
thought 1
we 1
was 1
right 1
on 1
the 1
track 1
of 1
a 1
solution 1
but 1
it 1
s 1
gone 1
to 1
grass 1
partly 1
But 1
anyway 1
one 1
thing 1
is 1
proved 1
these 1
two 1
ain 1
t 1
either 1
of 1
em 1
Wilkses 1
and 1
he 1
wagged 1
his 1
head 1
towards 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
Well 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
That 1
muleheaded 1
old 1
fool 1
wouldn 1
t 1
give 1
in 1
then 1
Indeed 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
Said 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
fair 1
test 1
Said 1
his 1
brother 1
William 1
was 1
the 1
cussedest 1
joker 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
hadn 1
t 1
tried 1
to 1
write 1
he 1
see 1
William 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
play 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
jokes 1
the 1
minute 1
he 1
put 1
the 1
pen 1
to 1
paper 1
And 1
so 1
he 1
warmed 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
warbling 1
and 1
warbling 1
right 1
along 1
till 1
he 1
was 1
actuly 1
beginning 1
to 1
believe 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
saying 1
himself 1
but 1
pretty 1
soon 1
the 1
new 1
gentleman 1
broke 1
in 1
and 1
says 1
I 1
ve 1
thought 1
of 1
something 1
Is 1
there 1
anybody 1
here 1
that 1
helped 1
to 1
lay 1
out 1
my 1
br 1
helped 1
to 1
lay 1
out 1
the 1
late 1
Peter 1
Wilks 1
for 1
burying 1
Yes 1
says 1
somebody 1
me 1
and 1
Ab 1
Turner 1
done 1
it 1
We 1
re 1
both 1
here 1
Then 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
turns 1
towards 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
says 1
Perhaps 1
this 1
gentleman 1
can 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
was 1
tattooed 1
on 1
his 1
breast 1
Blamed 1
if 1
the 1
king 1
didn 1
t 1
have 1
to 1
brace 1
up 1
mighty 1
quick 1
or 1
he 1
d 1
a 1
squshed 1
down 1
like 1
a 1
bluff 1
bank 1
that 1
the 1
river 1
has 1
cut 1
under 1
it 1
took 1
him 1
so 1
sudden 1
and 1
mind 1
you 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
thing 1
that 1
was 1
calculated 1
to 1
make 1
most 1
anybody 1
sqush 1
to 1
get 1
fetched 1
such 1
a 1
solid 1
one 1
as 1
that 1
without 1
any 1
notice 1
because 1
how 1
was 1
he 1
going 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
was 1
tattooed 1
on 1
the 1
man 1
He 1
whitened 1
a 1
little 1
he 1
couldn 1
t 1
help 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
mighty 1
still 1
in 1
there 1
and 1
everybody 1
bending 1
a 1
little 1
forwards 1
and 1
gazing 1
at 1
him 1
Says 1
I 1
to 1
myself 1
now 1

ll 1
throw 1
up 1
the 1
sponge 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
more 1
use 1
Well 1
did 1
he 1
A 1
body 1
can 1
t 1
hardly 1
believe 1
it 1
but 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
I 1
reckon 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
d 1
keep 1
the 1
thing 1
up 1
till 1
he 1
tired 1
them 1
people 1
out 1
so 1
they 1
d 1
thin 1
out 1
and 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
could 1
break 1
loose 1
and 1
get 1
away 1
Anyway 1
he 1
set 1
there 1
and 1
pretty 1
soon 1
he 1
begun 1
to 1
smile 1
and 1
says 1

The 1

brisk 1
towards 1
Ab 1

and 1
says 1

Good 1
says 1
the 1
old 1
gentleman 1
Now 1
what 1
you 1
did 1
see 1
on 1
his 1
breast 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
dim 1
P 1
and 1
a 1
B 1
which 1
is 1
an 1
initial 1
he 1
dropped 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
young 1
and 1
a 1
W 1
with 1
dashes 1
between 1
them 1
so 1
P 1
B 1
W 1
and 1
he 1
marked 1
them 1
that 1
way 1
on 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
paper 1
Come 1

Both 1
of 1

and 1
says 1
No 1

We 1
never 1

Well 1
everybody 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
mind 1
now 1
and 1
they 1

The 1

at 1
once 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
rattling 1
powwow 1
But 1
the 1
lawyer 1
he 1
jumps 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
yells 1
and 1
says 1
Gentlemen 1

That 1
took 1
them 1
Hooray 1
they 1
all 1
shouted 1
and 1
was 1
starting 1
right 1
off 1
but 1
the 1
lawyer 1
and 1
the 1
doctor 1
sung 1
out 1
Hold 1

on 1
Collar 1
all 1
these 1
four 1
men 1
and 1
the 1
boy 1
and 1
fetch 1
them 1
along 1
too 1
We 1
ll 1
do 1
it 1
they 1
all 1
shouted 1
and 1
if 1
we 1
don 1
t 1
find 1

ll 1
lynch 1
the 1
whole 1
gang 1

now 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
But 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
getting 1
away 1
you 1
know 1
They 1
gripped 1
us 1
all 1
and 1
marched 1
us 1
right 1
along 1
straight 1
for 1
the 1
graveyard 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
mile 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
town 1
at 1
our 1
heels 1
for 1
we 1
made 1
noise 1
enough 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
nine 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
As 1
we 1
went 1
by 1
our 1
house 1
I 1
wished 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
sent 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
out 1
of 1
town 1
because 1
now 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
tip 1
her 1
the 1
wink 1
she 1
d 1
light 1
out 1
and 1
save 1
me 1
and 1
blow 1
on 1
our 1
dead 1
beats 1
Well 1
we 1
swarmed 1
along 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
road 1
just 1
carrying 1
on 1
like 1
wildcats 1
and 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
more 1
scary 1
the 1
sky 1
was 1
darking 1
up 1
and 1
the 1
lightning 1
beginning 1
to 1
wink 1
and 1
flitter 1
and 1
the 1
wind 1
to 1
shiver 1
amongst 1
the 1
leaves 1
This 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
awful 1
trouble 1
and 1
most 1
dangersome 1
I 1
ever 1
was 1
in 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
kinder 1
stunned 1
everything 1
was 1
going 1
so 1
different 1
from 1
what 1
I 1
had 1
allowed 1
for 1
stead 1
of 1
being 1
fixed 1
so 1
I 1
could 1
take 1
my 1
own 1
time 1
if 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
and 1
see 1
all 1
the 1
fun 1
and 1
have 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
at 1
my 1
back 1
to 1
save 1
me 1
and 1
set 1
me 1
free 1
when 1
the 1
close 1
fit 1
come 1
here 1
was 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
betwixt 1
me 1
and 1
sudden 1
death 1
but 1
just 1
them 1
tattoo 1
marks 1
If 1
they 1
didn 1
t 1
find 1
them 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
bear 1
to 1
think 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
yet 1
somehow 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
think 1
about 1
nothing 1
else 1
It 1
got 1
darker 1
and 1
darker 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
beautiful 1
time 1
to 1
give 1
the 1
crowd 1
the 1
slip 1
but 1
that 1
big 1
husky 1
had 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
wrist 1
Hines 1
and 1
a 1
body 1
might 1
as 1
well 1
try 1
to 1
give 1
Goliar 1
the 1
slip 1
He 1
dragged 1
me 1
right 1
along 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
excited 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
run 1
to 1
keep 1
up 1
When 1
they 1
got 1
there 1
they 1
swarmed 1
into 1
the 1
graveyard 1
and 1
washed 1
over 1
it 1
like 1
an 1
overflow 1
And 1
when 1
they 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
grave 1
they 1
found 1
they 1
had 1
about 1
a 1
hundred 1
times 1
as 1
many 1
shovels 1
as 1
they 1
wanted 1
but 1
nobody 1
hadn 1
t 1
thought 1
to 1
fetch 1
a 1
lantern 1
But 1
they 1
sailed 1
into 1
digging 1
anyway 1
by 1
the 1
flicker 1
of 1
the 1
lightning 1
and 1
sent 1
a 1
man 1
to 1
the 1
nearest 1
house 1
a 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
off 1
to 1
borrow 1
one 1
So 1
they 1
dug 1
and 1
dug 1
like 1
everything 1
and 1
it 1
got 1
awful 1
dark 1
and 1
the 1
rain 1
started 1
and 1
the 1
wind 1
swished 1
and 1
swushed 1
along 1
and 1
the 1
lightning 1
come 1
brisker 1
and 1
brisker 1
and 1
the 1
thunder 1
boomed 1
but 1
them 1
people 1
never 1
took 1
no 1
notice 1
of 1
it 1
they 1
was 1
so 1
full 1
of 1
this 1
business 1
and 1
one 1
minute 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
everything 1
and 1
every 1
face 1
in 1
that 1
big 1
crowd 1
and 1
the 1
shovelfuls 1
of 1
dirt 1
sailing 1
up 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
grave 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
second 1
the 1
dark 1
wiped 1
it 1
all 1
out 1
and 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
nothing 1
at 1
all 1
At 1
last 1
they 1
got 1
out 1
the 1
coffin 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
unscrew 1
the 1
lid 1
and 1
then 1
such 1
another 1
crowding 1
and 1
shouldering 1
and 1
shoving 1
as 1
there 1
was 1
to 1
scrouge 1
in 1
and 1
get 1
a 1
sight 1
you 1
never 1
see 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
that 1
way 1
it 1
was 1
awful 1
Hines 1
he 1
hurt 1
my 1
wrist 1
dreadful 1
pulling 1
and 1
tugging 1
so 1
and 1
I 1
reckon 1
he 1
clean 1
forgot 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
excited 1
and 1
panting 1
All 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
the 1
lightning 1
let 1
go 1
a 1
perfect 1
sluice 1
of 1
white 1
glare 1
and 1
somebody 1
sings 1
out 1
By 1
the 1
living 1
jingo 1
here 1
s 1
the 1
bag 1
of 1
gold 1
on 1
his 1
breast 1
Hines 1
let 1
out 1
a 1
whoop 1
like 1
everybody 1
else 1
and 1
dropped 1
my 1
wrist 1
and 1
give 1
a 1
big 1
surge 1
to 1
bust 1
his 1
way 1
in 1
and 1
get 1
a 1
look 1
and 1
the 1
way 1
I 1
lit 1
out 1
and 1
shinned 1
for 1
the 1
road 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
nobody 1
can 1
tell 1
I 1
had 1
the 1
road 1
all 1
to 1
myself 1
and 1
I 1
fairly 1
flew 1
leastways 1
I 1
had 1
it 1
all 1
to 1
myself 1
except 1
the 1
solid 1
dark 1
and 1
the 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
glares 1
and 1
the 1
buzzing 1
of 1
the 1
rain 1
and 1
the 1
thrashing 1
of 1
the 1
wind 1
and 1
the 1
splitting 1
of 1
the 1
thunder 1
and 1
sure 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
born 1
I 1
did 1
clip 1
it 1
along 1
When 1
I 1
struck 1
the 1
town 1
I 1
see 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
nobody 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
storm 1
so 1
I 1
never 1
hunted 1
for 1
no 1
back 1
streets 1
but 1
humped 1
it 1
straight 1
through 1
the 1
main 1
one 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
begun 1
to 1
get 1
towards 1
our 1
house 1
I 1
aimed 1
my 1
eye 1
and 1
set 1
it 1
No 1
light 1
there 1
the 1
house 1
all 1
dark 1
which 1
made 1
me 1
feel 1
sorry 1
and 1
disappointed 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
why 1
But 1
at 1
last 1
just 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
sailing 1
by 1
flash 1
comes 1
the 1
light 1
in 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
s 1
window 1
and 1
my 1
heart 1
swelled 1
up 1
sudden 1
like 1
to 1
bust 1
and 1
the 1
same 1
second 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
all 1
was 1
behind 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
and 1
wasn 1
t 1
ever 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
before 1
me 1
no 1
more 1
in 1
this 1
world 1
She 1
was 1
the 1
best 1
girl 1
I 1
ever 1
see 1
and 1
had 1
the 1
most 1
sand 1
The 1
minute 1
I 1
was 1
far 1
enough 1
above 1
the 1
town 1
to 1
see 1
I 1
could 1
make 1
the 1
towhead 1
I 1
begun 1
to 1
look 1
sharp 1
for 1
a 1
boat 1
to 1
borrow 1
and 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
the 1
lightning 1
showed 1
me 1
one 1
that 1
wasn 1
t 1
chained 1
I 1
snatched 1
it 1
and 1
shoved 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
canoe 1
and 1
warn 1
t 1
fastened 1
with 1
nothing 1
but 1
a 1
rope 1
The 1
towhead 1
was 1
a 1
rattling 1
big 1
distance 1
off 1
away 1
out 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
but 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
lose 1
no 1
time 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
struck 1
the 1
raft 1
at 1
last 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
fagged 1
I 1
would 1
a 1
just 1
laid 1
down 1
to 1
blow 1
and 1
gasp 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
afforded 1
it 1
But 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
As 1
I 1
sprung 1
aboard 1
I 1
sung 1
out 1
Out 1
with 1
you 1
Jim 1
and 1
set 1
her 1
loose 1
Glory 1
be 1
to 1
goodness 1
we 1
re 1
shut 1
of 1
them 1
Jim 1
lit 1
out 1
and 1
was 1
a 1
coming 1
for 1
me 1
with 1
both 1
arms 1
spread 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
full 1
of 1
joy 1
but 1
when 1
I 1
glimpsed 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
lightning 1
my 1
heart 1
shot 1
up 1
in 1
my 1
mouth 1
and 1
I 1
went 1
overboard 1
backwards 1
for 1
I 1
forgot 1
he 1
was 1
old 1
King 1
Lear 1
and 1
a 1
drownded 1
A 1
rab 1
all 1
in 1
one 1
and 1
it 1
most 1
scared 1
the 1
livers 1
and 1
lights 1
out 1
of 1
me 1
But 1
Jim 1
fished 1
me 1
out 1
and 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
hug 1
me 1
and 1
bless 1
me 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
glad 1
I 1
was 1
back 1
and 1
we 1
was 1
shut 1
of 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
but 1
I 1
says 1
Not 1
now 1
have 1
it 1
for 1
breakfast 1
have 1
it 1
for 1
breakfast 1
Cut 1
loose 1
and 1
let 1
her 1
slide 1
So 1
in 1
two 1
seconds 1
away 1
we 1
went 1
a 1
sliding 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
it 1
did 1
seem 1
so 1
good 1
to 1
be 1
free 1
again 1
and 1
all 1
by 1
ourselves 1
on 1
the 1
big 1
river 1
and 1
nobody 1
to 1
bother 1
us 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
skip 1
around 1
a 1
bit 1
and 1
jump 1
up 1
and 1
crack 1
my 1
heels 1
a 1
few 1
times 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
help 1
it 1
but 1
about 1
the 1
third 1
crack 1
I 1
noticed 1
a 1
sound 1
that 1
I 1
knowed 1
mighty 1
well 1
and 1
held 1
my 1
breath 1
and 1
listened 1
and 1
waited 1
and 1
sure 1
enough 1
when 1
the 1
next 1
flash 1
busted 1
out 1
over 1
the 1
water 1
here 1
they 1
come 1
and 1
just 1
a 1
laying 1
to 1
their 1
oars 1
and 1
making 1
their 1
skiff 1
hum 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
So 1
I 1
wilted 1
right 1
down 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
planks 1
then 1
and 1
give 1
up 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
I 1
could 1
do 1
to 1
keep 1
from 1
crying 1
CHAPTER 1
XXX 1
WHEN 1
they 1
got 1
aboard 1
the 1
king 1
went 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
shook 1
me 1

collar 1
and 1
says 1

Honest 1

The 1
man 1
that 1
had 1
a 1
holt 1
of 1
me 1
was 1
very 1
good 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
kept 1
saying 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
boy 1
about 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
me 1
that 1
died 1
last 1
year 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
sorry 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
boy 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
dangerous 1
fix 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
was 1
all 1
took 1
by 1
surprise 1
by 1
finding 1
the 1
gold 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
rush 1
for 1

and 1
whispers 1
Heel 1

and 1
I 1
lit 1

It 1

t 1
seem 1
no 1
good 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
stay 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
do 1
nothing 1
and 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
hung 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
get 1
away 1
So 1
I 1
never 1
stopped 1
running 1
till 1
I 1
found 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
got 1
here 1
I 1
told 1
Jim 1
to 1
hurry 1
or 1
they 1
d 1
catch 1
me 1
and 1
hang 1
me 1
yet 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
was 1
afeard 1
you 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
wasn 1
t 1
alive 1
now 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
awful 1
sorry 1
and 1
so 1
was 1
Jim 1
and 1
was 1
awful 1
glad 1
when 1
we 1
see 1
you 1
coming 1
you 1
may 1
ask 1
Jim 1
if 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
Jim 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
told 1
him 1
to 1
shut 1
up 1
and 1
said 1
Oh 1
yes 1
it 1
s 1
mighty 1
likely 1
and 1
shook 1
me 1
up 1
again 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
reckoned 1
he 1
d 1
drownd 1
me 1
But 1
the 1
duke 1
says 1
Leggo 1
the 1
boy 1
you 1
old 1
idiot 1
Would 1
you 1
a 1
done 1
any 1
different 1
Did 1
you 1
inquire 1
around 1
for 1
him 1
when 1
you 1
got 1
loose 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
remember 1
it 1
So 1
the 1
king 1
let 1
go 1
of 1
me 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
cuss 1
that 1
town 1
and 1
everybody 1
in 1
it 1
But 1
the 1
duke 1
says 1
You 1
better 1
a 1
blame 1
sight 1
give 1
yourself 1
a 1
good 1
cussing 1
for 1
you 1
re 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
s 1
entitled 1
to 1
it 1
most 1
You 1
hain 1
t 1
done 1
a 1
thing 1
from 1
the 1
start 1
that 1
had 1
any 1
sense 1
in 1
it 1
except 1
coming 1
out 1
so 1
cool 1
and 1
cheeky 1
with 1
that 1
imaginary 1
blue 1
arrow 1
mark 1
That 1
was 1
bright 1
it 1
was 1
right 1
down 1
bully 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
thing 1
that 1
saved 1
us 1
For 1
if 1
it 1
hadn 1
t 1
been 1
for 1
that 1
they 1
d 1
a 1
jailed 1
us 1
till 1
them 1
Englishmen 1
s 1
baggage 1
come 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
penitentiary 1
you 1
bet 1
But 1
that 1
trick 1
took 1
em 1
to 1
the 1
graveyard 1
and 1
the 1
gold 1
done 1
us 1
a 1
still 1
bigger 1
kindness 1
for 1
if 1
the 1
excited 1
fools 1
hadn 1
t 1
let 1
go 1
all 1
holts 1
and 1
made 1
that 1
rush 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
look 1
we 1
d 1
a 1
slept 1
in 1
our 1
cravats 1
to 1
night 1
cravats 1
warranted 1
to 1
wear 1
too 1
longer 1
than 1
we 1
d 1
need 1
em 1
They 1
was 1
still 1
a 1
minute 1
thinking 1
then 1
the 1
king 1
says 1
kind 1
of 1
absent 1
minded 1
like 1
Mf 1
And 1
we 1
reckoned 1
the 1
niggers 1
stole 1
it 1
That 1
made 1
me 1
squirm 1
Yes 1
says 1
the 1
duke 1
kinder 1
slow 1
and 1
deliberate 1
and 1
sarcastic 1
we 1
did 1
After 1
about 1
a 1
half 1
a 1
minute 1
the 1
king 1
drawls 1
out 1
Leastways 1
I 1
did 1
The 1
duke 1
says 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
On 1
the 1
contrary 1
I 1
did 1
The 1
king 1
kind 1
of 1
ruffles 1
up 1
and 1
says 1
Looky 1
here 1
Bilgewater 1
what 1
r 1

The 1
duke 1
says 1
pretty 1
brisk 1
When 1
it 1
comes 1
to 1
that 1
maybe 1
you 1
ll 1
let 1
me 1
ask 1
what 1
was 1
you 1
referring 1
to 1
Shucks 1
says 1
the 1
king 1
very 1
sarcastic 1
but 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
maybe 1
you 1
was 1
asleep 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
you 1
was 1
about 1
The 1
duke 1
bristles 1
up 1
now 1
and 1
says 1
Oh 1
let 1
up 1
on 1
this 1
cussed 1
nonsense 1
do 1
you 1
take 1
me 1
for 1
a 1

fool 1
Don 1

reckon 1
I 1
know 1
who 1
hid 1
that 1
money 1
in 1
that 1
coffin 1
Yes 1
sir 1
I 1
know 1
you 1
do 1
know 1
because 1
you 1
done 1
it 1
yourself 1
It 1
s 1
a 1
lie 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
went 1
for 1
him 1
The 1
king 1
sings 1
out 1
Take 1
y 1
r 1
hands 1
off 1
leggo 1
my 1
throat 1
I 1
take 1

The 1
duke 1
says 1
Well 1
you 1
just 1
own 1
up 1
first 1
that 1
you 1
did 1
hide 1
that 1
money 1
there 1
intending 1
to 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
slip 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
days 1
and 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
dig 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
have 1

all 1
to 1
yourself 1
Wait 1
jest 1
a 1
minute 1
duke 1
answer 1
me 1
this 1
one 1
question 1
honest 1
and 1
fair 1
if 1
you 1
didn 1

money 1

say 1
it 1
and 1
I 1
ll 1
b 1

and 1
take 1

I 1
said 1
You 1

There 1

Well 1

But 1

you 1
have 1
it 1
in 1
your 1
mind 1
to 1

money 1
and 1
hide 1
it 1
The 1
duke 1
never 1
said 1
nothing 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
bit 1
then 1
he 1
says 1
Well 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
if 1
I 1
did 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
do 1
it 1
anyway 1
But 1
you 1
not 1
only 1
had 1
it 1
in 1
mind 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
but 1
you 1
done 1
it 1
I 1
wisht 1
I 1
never 1
die 1
if 1
I 1
done 1
it 1
duke 1
and 1
that 1
s 1
honest 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
say 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
goin 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
because 1
I 1
was 1
but 1
you 1
I 1
mean 1
somebody 1
got 1
in 1
ahead 1
o 1
me 1
It 1
s 1
a 1
lie 1
You 1
done 1
it 1
and 1
you 1
got 1
to 1
say 1
you 1
done 1
it 1
or 1
The 1
king 1
began 1
to 1
gurgle 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
gasps 1
out 1
Nough 1
I 1
own 1
up 1
I 1
was 1
very 1
glad 1
to 1
hear 1
him 1
say 1
that 1
it 1
made 1
me 1
feel 1
much 1
more 1
easier 1
than 1
what 1
I 1
was 1
feeling 1
before 1
So 1
the 1
duke 1
took 1
his 1
hands 1
off 1
and 1
says 1
If 1
you 1
ever 1
deny 1
it 1
again 1
I 1
ll 1
drown 1
you 1
It 1
s 1
well 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
set 1
there 1
and 1
blubber 1
like 1
a 1
baby 1
it 1
s 1
fitten 1
for 1
you 1
after 1
the 1
way 1
you 1
ve 1
acted 1
I 1
never 1
see 1
such 1
an 1
old 1
ostrich 1
for 1
wanting 1
to 1
gobble 1
everything 1
and 1
I 1
a 1
trusting 1
you 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
like 1
you 1
was 1
my 1
own 1
father 1
You 1
ought 1
to 1
been 1
ashamed 1
of 1
yourself 1
to 1
stand 1
by 1
and 1
hear 1
it 1
saddled 1
on 1
to 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
poor 1
niggers 1
and 1
you 1
never 1
say 1
a 1
word 1
for 1
em 1
It 1
makes 1
me 1
feel 1
ridiculous 1
to 1
think 1
I 1
was 1
soft 1
enough 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
rubbage 1
Cuss 1
you 1
I 1
can 1
see 1
now 1
why 1
you 1
was 1
so 1
anxious 1
to 1
make 1
up 1
the 1
deffisit 1
you 1
wanted 1
to 1
get 1
what 1
money 1
I 1
d 1
got 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
Nonesuch 1
and 1
one 1
thing 1
or 1
another 1
and 1
scoop 1
it 1
all 1
The 1
king 1
says 1
timid 1
and 1
still 1
a 1
snuffling 1
Why 1
duke 1
it 1
was 1
you 1
that 1
said 1
make 1
up 1
the 1
deffisit 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
me 1
Dry 1
up 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
hear 1
no 1
more 1
out 1
of 1
you 1
says 1
the 1
duke 1
And 1
now 1
you 1
see 1
what 1
you 1
GOT 1
by 1
it 1
They 1
ve 1
got 1
all 1
their 1
own 1
money 1
back 1
and 1
all 1
of 1
ourn 1
but 1
a 1
shekel 1
or 1
two 1
besides 1
G 1
long 1
to 1
bed 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
deffersit 1
me 1
no 1
more 1
deffersits 1
long 1
s 1
you 1
live 1
So 1
the 1
king 1
sneaked 1
into 1
the 1
wigwam 1
and 1
took 1
to 1
his 1
bottle 1
for 1
comfort 1
and 1
before 1
long 1
the 1
duke 1
tackled 1
HIS 1
bottle 1
and 1
so 1
in 1
about 1
a 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
they 1
was 1
as 1
thick 1
as 1
thieves 1
again 1
and 1
the 1
tighter 1
they 1
got 1
the 1
lovinger 1
they 1
got 1
and 1
went 1
off 1
a 1
snoring 1
in 1
each 1
other 1
s 1
arms 1
They 1
both 1
got 1
powerful 1
mellow 1
but 1
I 1
noticed 1
the 1
king 1
didn 1
t 1
get 1
mellow 1
enough 1
to 1
forget 1
to 1
remember 1
to 1
not 1
deny 1
about 1
hiding 1
the 1
money 1
bag 1
again 1
That 1
made 1
me 1
feel 1
easy 1
and 1
satisfied 1
Of 1
course 1
when 1
they 1
got 1
to 1
snoring 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
long 1
gabble 1
and 1
I 1
told 1
Jim 1
everything 1
CHAPTER 1
XXXI 1
WE 1
dasn 1
t 1
stop 1
again 1
at 1
any 1
town 1
for 1
days 1
and 1
days 1
kept 1
right 1
along 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
We 1
was 1
down 1
south 1
in 1
the 1
warm 1
weather 1
now 1
and 1
a 1
mighty 1
long 1
ways 1
from 1
home 1
We 1
begun 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
trees 1
with 1
Spanish 1
moss 1
on 1
them 1
hanging 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
limbs 1
like 1
long 1
gray 1
beards 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
I 1
ever 1
see 1
it 1
growing 1
and 1
it 1
made 1
the 1
woods 1
look 1
solemn 1
and 1
dismal 1
So 1
now 1
the 1
frauds 1
reckoned 1
they 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
danger 1
and 1
they 1
begun 1
to 1
work 1
the 1
villages 1
again 1
First 1
they 1
done 1
a 1
lecture 1
on 1
temperance 1
but 1
they 1
didn 1
t 1
make 1
enough 1
for 1
them 1
both 1
to 1
get 1
drunk 1
on 1
Then 1
in 1
another 1
village 1
they 1
started 1
a 1
dancing 1
school 1
but 1
they 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
no 1
more 1
how 1
to 1
dance 1
than 1
a 1
kangaroo 1
does 1
so 1
the 1
first 1
prance 1
they 1
made 1
the 1
general 1
public 1
jumped 1
in 1
and 1
pranced 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
town 1
Another 1
time 1
they 1
tried 1
to 1
go 1
at 1
yellocution 1
but 1
they 1
didn 1
t 1
yellocute 1
long 1
till 1
the 1
audience 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
give 1
them 1
a 1
solid 1
good 1
cussing 1
and 1
made 1
them 1
skip 1
out 1
They 1
tackled 1
missionarying 1
and 1
mesmerizing 1
and 1
doctoring 1
and 1
telling 1
fortunes 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
of 1
everything 1
but 1
they 1
couldn 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
have 1
no 1
luck 1
So 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
got 1
just 1
about 1
dead 1
broke 1
and 1
laid 1
around 1
the 1
raft 1
as 1
she 1
floated 1
along 1
thinking 1
and 1
thinking 1
and 1
never 1
saying 1
nothing 1
by 1
the 1
half 1
a 1
day 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
and 1
dreadful 1
blue 1
and 1
desperate 1
And 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
took 1
a 1
change 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
lay 1
their 1
heads 1
together 1
in 1
the 1
wigwam 1
and 1
talk 1
low 1
and 1
confidential 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
hours 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
Jim 1
and 1
me 1
got 1
uneasy 1
We 1
didn 1
t 1
like 1
the 1
look 1
of 1
it 1
We 1
judged 1
they 1
was 1
studying 1
up 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
worse 1
deviltry 1
than 1
ever 1
We 1
turned 1
it 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
we 1
made 1
up 1
our 1
minds 1
they 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
break 1
into 1
somebody 1
s 1
house 1
or 1
store 1
or 1
was 1
going 1
into 1
the 1
counterfeit 1
money 1
business 1
or 1
something 1
So 1
then 1
we 1
was 1
pretty 1
scared 1
and 1
made 1
up 1
an 1
agreement 1
that 1
we 1
wouldn 1
t 1
have 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
such 1
actions 1
and 1
if 1
we 1
ever 1
got 1
the 1
least 1
show 1
we 1
would 1
give 1
them 1
the 1
cold 1
shake 1
and 1
clear 1
out 1
and 1
leave 1
them 1
behind 1
Well 1
early 1
one 1
morning 1
we 1
hid 1
the 1
raft 1
in 1
a 1
good 1
safe 1
place 1
about 1
two 1
mile 1
below 1
a 1
little 1
bit 1
of 1
a 1
shabby 1
village 1
named 1
Pikesville 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
he 1
went 1
ashore 1
and 1
told 1
us 1
all 1
to 1
stay 1
hid 1
whilst 1
he 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
town 1
and 1
smelt 1
around 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
anybody 1
had 1
got 1
any 1
wind 1
of 1
the 1
Royal 1
Nonesuch 1
there 1
yet 1
House 1
to 1
rob 1
you 1
mean 1
says 1
I 1
to 1
myself 1
and 1
when 1
you 1
get 1
through 1
robbing 1
it 1
you 1
ll 1
come 1
back 1
here 1
and 1
wonder 1
what 1
has 1
become 1
of 1
me 1
and 1
Jim 1
and 1
the 1
raft 1
and 1
you 1
ll 1
have 1
to 1
take 1
it 1
out 1
in 1
wondering 1
And 1
he 1
said 1
if 1
he 1
warn 1
t 1
back 1
by 1
midday 1
the 1
duke 1
and 1
me 1
would 1
know 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
we 1
was 1
to 1
come 1
along 1
So 1
we 1
stayed 1
where 1
we 1
was 1
The 1
duke 1
he 1
fretted 1
and 1
sweated 1
around 1
and 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
mighty 1
sour 1
way 1
He 1
scolded 1
us 1
for 1
everything 1
and 1
we 1
couldn 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
do 1
nothing 1
right 1
he 1
found 1
fault 1
with 1
every 1
little 1
thing 1
Something 1
was 1
a 1
brewing 1
sure 1
I 1
was 1
good 1
and 1
glad 1
when 1
midday 1
come 1
and 1
no 1
king 1
we 1
could 1
have 1
a 1
change 1
anyway 1
and 1
maybe 1
a 1
chance 1
for 1
the 1
change 1
on 1
top 1
of 1
it 1
So 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
hunted 1
around 1
there 1
for 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
we 1
found 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
back 1
room 1
of 1
a 1
little 1
low 1
doggery 1
very 1
tight 1
and 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
loafers 1
bullyragging 1
him 1
for 1
sport 1
and 1
he 1
a 1
cussing 1
and 1
a 1
threatening 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
might 1
and 1
so 1
tight 1
he 1
couldn 1
t 1
walk 1
and 1
couldn 1
t 1
do 1
nothing 1
to 1
them 1
The 1
duke 1
he 1
begun 1
to 1
abuse 1
him 1
for 1
an 1
old 1
fool 1
and 1
the 1
king 1
begun 1
to 1
sass 1
back 1
and 1
the 1
minute 1
they 1
was 1
fairly 1
at 1
it 1
I 1
lit 1
out 1
and 1
shook 1
the 1
reefs 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
hind 1
legs 1
and 1
spun 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
road 1
like 1
a 1
deer 1
for 1
I 1
see 1
our 1
chance 1
and 1
I 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
long 1
day 1
before 1
they 1
ever 1
see 1
me 1
and 1
Jim 1
again 1
I 1
got 1
down 1
there 1
all 1
out 1
of 1
breath 1
but 1
loaded 1
up 1
with 1
joy 1
and 1
sung 1
out 1
Set 1
her 1
loose 1
Jim 1
we 1
re 1
all 1
right 1
now 1
But 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
answer 1
and 1
nobody 1
come 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
wigwam 1
Jim 1
was 1
gone 1
I 1
set 1
up 1
a 1
shout 1
and 1
then 1
another 1
and 1
then 1
another 1
one 1
and 1
run 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
whooping 1
and 1
screeching 1
but 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
use 1
old 1
Jim 1
was 1
gone 1
Then 1
I 1
set 1
down 1
and 1
cried 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
help 1
it 1
But 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
set 1
still 1
long 1
Pretty 1
soon 1
I 1
went 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
road 1
trying 1
to 1
think 1
what 1
I 1
better 1
do 1
and 1
I 1
run 1
across 1
a 1
boy 1
walking 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
if 1
he 1
d 1
seen 1
a 1
strange 1
nigger 1
dressed 1
so 1
and 1
so 1
and 1
he 1
says 1
Yes 1
Whereabouts 1
says 1
I 1
Down 1
to 1
Silas 1
Phelps 1
place 1
two 1
mile 1
below 1
here 1
He 1
s 1
a 1
runaway 1
nigger 1
and 1
they 1
ve 1
got 1
him 1
Was 1
you 1
looking 1
for 1
him 1
You 1
bet 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
I 1
run 1
across 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
about 1
an 1
hour 1
or 1
two 1
ago 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
if 1
I 1
hollered 1
he 1
d 1
cut 1
my 1
livers 1
out 1
and 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
lay 1
down 1
and 1
stay 1
where 1
I 1
was 1
and 1
I 1
done 1
it 1
Been 1
there 1
ever 1
since 1
afeard 1
to 1
come 1
out 1
Well 1
he 1
says 1
you 1
needn 1
t 1
be 1
afeard 1
no 1
more 1
becuz 1
they 1
ve 1
got 1
him 1
He 1
run 1
off 1
f 1
m 1
down 1
South 1
som 1
ers 1
It 1
s 1
a 1
good 1
job 1
they 1
got 1
him 1
Well 1
I 1
reckon 1
There 1
s 1
two 1
hunderd 1
dollars 1
reward 1
on 1
him 1
It 1
s 1
like 1
picking 1
up 1
money 1
out 1
n 1
the 1
road 1
Yes 1
it 1
is 1
and 1
I 1
could 1
a 1
had 1
it 1
if 1
I 1
d 1
been 1
big 1
enough 1
I 1
see 1
him 1
first 1
Who 1
nailed 1
him 1
It 1
was 1
an 1
old 1
fellow 1
a 1
stranger 1
and 1
he 1
sold 1
out 1
his 1
chance 1
in 1
him 1
for 1
forty 1
dollars 1
becuz 1
he 1
s 1
got 1
to 1
go 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
can 1
t 1
wait 1
Think 1
o 1
that 1
now 1
You 1
bet 1
I 1
d 1
wait 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
seven 1
year 1
That 1
s 1
me 1
every 1
time 1
says 1
I 1
But 1
maybe 1
his 1
chance 1
ain 1
t 1
worth 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
that 1
if 1
he 1
ll 1
sell 1
it 1
so 1
cheap 1
Maybe 1
there 1
s 1
something 1
ain 1
t 1
straight 1
about 1
it 1
But 1
it 1
is 1
though 1
straight 1
as 1
a 1
string 1
I 1
see 1
the 1
handbill 1
myself 1
It 1
tells 1
all 1
about 1
him 1
to 1
a 1
dot 1
paints 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
picture 1
and 1
tells 1
the 1
plantation 1
he 1
s 1
frum 1
below 1
Newr 1
leans 1
No 1
sirree 1
bob 1
they 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
trouble 1
bout 1
that 1
speculation 1
you 1
bet 1
you 1
Say 1
gimme 1
a 1
chaw 1
tobacker 1
won 1
t 1
ye 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
have 1
none 1
so 1
he 1
left 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
raft 1
and 1
set 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
wigwam 1
to 1
think 1
But 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
come 1
to 1
nothing 1
I 1
thought 1
till 1
I 1
wore 1
my 1
head 1
sore 1
but 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
no 1
way 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
trouble 1
After 1
all 1
this 1
long 1
journey 1
and 1
after 1
all 1
we 1
d 1
done 1
for 1
them 1
scoundrels 1
here 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
come 1
to 1
nothing 1
everything 1
all 1
busted 1
up 1
and 1
ruined 1
because 1
they 1
could 1
have 1
the 1
heart 1
to 1
serve 1
Jim 1
such 1
a 1
trick 1
as 1
that 1
and 1
make 1
him 1
a 1
slave 1
again 1
all 1
his 1
life 1
and 1
amongst 1
strangers 1
too 1
for 1
forty 1
dirty 1
dollars 1
Once 1
I 1
said 1
to 1
myself 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
thousand 1
times 1
better 1
for 1
Jim 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
slave 1
at 1
home 1
where 1
his 1
family 1
was 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
he 1
d 1
got 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
slave 1
and 1
so 1
I 1
d 1
better 1
write 1
a 1
letter 1
to 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
and 1
tell 1
him 1
to 1
tell 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
But 1
I 1
soon 1
give 1
up 1
that 1
notion 1
for 1
two 1
things 1
she 1
d 1
be 1
mad 1
and 1
disgusted 1
at 1
his 1
rascality 1
and 1
ungratefulness 1
for 1
leaving 1
her 1
and 1
so 1
she 1
d 1
sell 1
him 1
straight 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
again 1
and 1
if 1
she 1
didn 1
t 1
everybody 1
naturally 1
despises 1
an 1
ungrateful 1
nigger 1
and 1
they 1
d 1
make 1
Jim 1
feel 1
it 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
d 1
feel 1
ornery 1
and 1
disgraced 1
And 1
then 1
think 1
of 1
me 1
It 1
would 1
get 1
all 1
around 1
that 1
Huck 1
Finn 1
helped 1
a 1
nigger 1
to 1
get 1
his 1
freedom 1
and 1
if 1
I 1
was 1
ever 1
to 1
see 1
anybody 1
from 1
that 1
town 1
again 1
I 1
d 1
be 1
ready 1
to 1
get 1
down 1
and 1
lick 1
his 1
boots 1
for 1
shame 1
That 1
s 1
just 1
the 1
way 1
a 1
person 1
does 1
a 1
low 1
down 1
thing 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
take 1
no 1
consequences 1
of 1
it 1
Thinks 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
he 1
can 1
hide 1
it 2
ain 1
t 1
no 1
disgrace 1
That 1
was 1
my 1
fix 1
exactly 1
The 1
more 1
I 1
studied 1
about 1
this 1
the 1
more 1
my 1
conscience 1
went 1
to 1
grinding 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
more 1
wicked 1
and 1
low 1
down 1
and 1
ornery 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
feeling 1
And 1
at 1
last 1
when 1
it 1
hit 1
me 1
all 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
that 1
here 1
was 1
the 1
plain 1
hand 1
of 1
Providence 1
slapping 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
and 1
letting 1
me 1
know 1
my 1
wickedness 1
was 1
being 1
watched 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
from 1
up 1
there 1
in 1
heaven 1
whilst 1
I 1
was 1
stealing 1
a 1
poor 1
old 1
woman 1
s 1
nigger 1
that 1
hadn 1
t 1
ever 1
done 1
me 1
no 1
harm 1
and 1
now 1
was 1
showing 1
me 1
there 1
s 1
One 1
that 1
s 1
always 1
on 1
the 1
lookout 1
and 1
ain 1
t 1
a 1
going 1
to 1
allow 1
no 1
such 1
miserable 1
doings 1
to 1
go 1
only 1
just 1
so 1
fur 1
and 1
no 1
further 1
I 1
most 1
dropped 1
in 1
my 1
tracks 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
scared 1
Well 1
I 1
tried 1
the 1
best 1
I 1
could 1
to 1
kinder 1
soften 1
it 1
up 1
somehow 1
for 1
myself 1
by 1
saying 1
I 1
was 1
brung 1
up 1
wicked 1
and 1
so 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
so 1
much 1
to 1
blame 1
but 1
something 1
inside 1
of 1
me 1
kept 1
saying 1
There 1
was 1
the 1
Sunday 1
school 1
you 1
could 1
a 1
gone 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
d 1
a 1
done 1
it 1
they 1
d 1
a 1
learnt 1
you 1
there 1
that 1
people 1
that 1
acts 1
as 1
I 1
d 1
been 1
acting 1
about 1
that 1
nigger 1
goes 1
to 1
everlasting 1
fire 1
It 1
made 1
me 1
shiver 1
And 1
I 1
about 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
to 1
pray 1
and 1
see 1
if 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
try 1
to 1
quit 1
being 1
the 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
boy 1
I 1
was 1
and 1
be 1
better 1
So 1
I 1
kneeled 1
down 1
But 1
the 1
words 1
wouldn 1
t 1
come 1
Why 1
wouldn 1
t 1
they 1
It 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
hide 1
it 1
from 1
Him 1
Nor 1
from 1
me 1
neither 1
I 1
knowed 1
very 1
well 1
why 1
they 1
wouldn 1
t 1
come 1
It 1
was 1
because 1
my 1
heart 1
warn 1
t 1
right 1
it 1
was 1
because 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
square 1
it 1
was 1
because 1
I 1
was 1
playing 1
double 1
I 1
was 1
letting 1
on 1
to 1
give 1
up 1
sin 1
but 1
away 1
inside 1
of 1
me 1
I 1
was 1
holding 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
biggest 1
one 1
of 1
all 1
I 1
was 1
trying 1
to 1
make 1
my 1
mouth 1
say 1
I 1
would 1
do 1
the 1
right 1
thing 1
and 1
the 1
clean 1
thing 1
and 1
go 1
and 1
write 1
to 1
that 1
nigger 1
s 1
owner 1
and 1
tell 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
but 1
deep 1
down 1
in 1
me 1
I 1
knowed 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
lie 1
and 1
He 1
knowed 1
it 1
You 1
can 1
t 1
pray 1
a 1
lie 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
out 1
So 1
I 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
trouble 1
full 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
be 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
At 1
last 1
I 1
had 1
an 1
idea 1
and 1
I 1
says 1
I 1
ll 1
go 1
and 1
write 1
the 1
letter 1
and 1
then 1
see 1
if 1
I 1
can 1
pray 1
Why 1
it 1
was 1
astonishing 1
the 1
way 1
I 1
felt 1
as 1
light 1
as 1
a 1
feather 1
right 1
straight 1
off 1
and 1
my 1
troubles 1
all 1
gone 1
So 1
I 1
got 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
paper 1
and 1
a 1
pencil 1
all 1
glad 1
and 1
excited 1
and 1
set 1
down 1
and 1
wrote 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
your 1
runaway 1
nigger 1
Jim 1
is 1
down 1
here 1
two 1
mile 1
below 1
Pikesville 1
and 1
Mr 1
Phelps 1
has 1
got 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
will 1
give 1
him 1
up 1
for 1
the 1
reward 1
if 1
you 1
send 1
Huck 1
Finn 1
I 1
felt 1
good 1
and 1
all 1
washed 1
clean 1
of 1
sin 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
I 1
had 1
ever 1
felt 1
so 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
and 1
I 1
knowed 1
I 1
could 1
pray 1
now 1
But 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
do 1
it 1
straight 1
off 1
but 1
laid 1
the 1
paper 1
down 1
and 1
set 1
there 1
thinking 2
how 1
good 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
this 1
happened 1
so 1
and 1
how 1
near 1
I 1
come 1
to 1
being 1
lost 1
and 1
going 1
to 1
hell 1
And 1
went 1
on 1
thinking 1
And 1
got 1
to 1
thinking 1
over 1
our 1
trip 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
I 1
see 1
Jim 1
before 1
me 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
in 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
time 1
sometimes 1
moonlight 1
sometimes 1
storms 1
and 1
we 1
a 1
floating 1
along 1
talking 1
and 1
singing 1
and 1
laughing 1
But 1
somehow 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
strike 1
no 1
places 1
to 1
harden 1
me 1
against 1
him 1
but 1
only 1
the 1
other 1
kind 1
I 1
d 1
see 1
him 1
standing 1
my 1
watch 1
on 1
top 1
of 1
his 1
n 1
stead 1
of 1
calling 1
me 1
so 1
I 1
could 1
go 1
on 1
sleeping 1
and 1
see 1
him 1
how 1
glad 1
he 1
was 1
when 1
I 1
come 1
back 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
fog 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
come 1
to 1
him 1
again 1
in 1
the 1
swamp 1
up 1
there 1
where 1
the 1
feud 1
was 1
and 1
such 1
like 1
times 1
and 1
would 1
always 1
call 1
me 1
honey 1
and 1
pet 1
me 1
and 1
do 1
everything 1
he 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
how 1
good 1
he 1
always 1
was 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
I 1
struck 1
the 1
time 1
I 1
saved 1
him 1
by 1
telling 1
the 1
men 1
we 1
had 1
small 1
pox 1
aboard 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
grateful 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
was 1
the 1
best 1
friend 1
old 1
Jim 1
ever 1
had 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
he 1
s 1
got 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
happened 1
to 1
look 1
around 1
and 1
see 1
that 1
paper 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
close 1
place 1
I 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
held 1
it 1
in 1
my 1
hand 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
trembling 1
because 1
I 1
d 1
got 1
to 1
decide 1
forever 1
betwixt 1
two 1
things 1
and 1
I 1
knowed 1
it 1
I 1
studied 1
a 1
minute 1
sort 1
of 1
holding 1
my 1
breath 1
and 1
then 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
All 1
right 1
then 1
I 1
ll 1
go 1
to 1
hell 1
and 1
tore 1
it 1
up 1
It 1
was 1
awful 1
thoughts 1
and 1
awful 1
words 1
but 1
they 1
was 1
said 1
And 1
I 1
let 1
them 1
stay 1
said 1
and 1
never 1
thought 1
no 1
more 1
about 1
reforming 1
I 1
shoved 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
head 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
would 1
take 1
up 1
wickedness 1
again 1
which 1
was 1
in 1
my 1
line 1
being 1
brung 1
up 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
warn 1
t 1
And 1
for 1
a 1
starter 1
I 1
would 1
go 1
to 1
work 1
and 1
steal 1
Jim 1
out 1
of 1
slavery 1
again 1
and 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
think 1
up 1
anything 1
worse 1
I 1
would 1
do 1
that 1
too 1
because 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
and 1
in 1
for 1
good 1
I 1
might 1
as 1
well 1
go 1
the 1
whole 1
hog 1
Then 1
I 1
set 1
to 1
thinking 1
over 1
how 1
to 1
get 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
turned 1
over 1
some 1
considerable 1
many 1
ways 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
fixed 1
up 1
a 1
plan 1
that 1
suited 1
me 1
So 1
then 1
I 1
took 1
the 1
bearings 1
of 1
a 1
woody 1
island 1
that 1
was 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
a 1
piece 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
fairly 1
dark 1
I 1
crept 1
out 1
with 1
my 1
raft 1
and 1
went 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
hid 1
it 1
there 1
and 1
then 1
turned 1
in 1
I 1
slept 1
the 1
night 1
through 1
and 1
got 1
up 1
before 1
it 1
was 1
light 1
and 1
had 1
my 1
breakfast 1
and 1
put 1
on 1
my 1
store 1
clothes 1
and 1
tied 1
up 1
some 1
others 1
and 1
one 1
thing 1
or 1
another 1
in 1
a 1
bundle 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
cleared 1
for 1
shore 1
I 1
landed 1
below 1
where 1
I 1
judged 1
was 1
Phelps 1
s 1
place 1
and 1
hid 1
my 1
bundle 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
then 1
filled 1
up 1
the 1
canoe 1
with 1
water 1
and 1
loaded 1
rocks 1
into 1
her 1
and 1
sunk 1
her 1
where 1
I 1
could 1
find 1
her 1
again 1
when 1
I 1
wanted 1
her 1
about 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
below 1
a 1
little 1
steam 1
sawmill 1
that 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
Then 1
I 1
struck 1
up 1
the 1
road 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
passed 1
the 1
mill 1
I 1
see 1
a 1
sign 1
on 1
it 1
Phelps 1
s 1
Sawmill 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
farm 1
houses 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
hundred 1
yards 1
further 1
along 1
I 1
kept 1
my 1
eyes 1
peeled 1
but 1
didn 1
t 1
see 1
nobody 1
around 1
though 1
it 1
was 1
good 1
daylight 1
now 1
But 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
mind 1
because 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
nobody 1
just 1
yet 1
I 1
only 1
wanted 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
lay 1
of 1
the 1
land 1
According 1
to 1
my 1
plan 1
I 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
turn 1
up 1
there 1
from 1
the 1
village 1
not 1
from 1
below 1
So 1
I 1
just 1
took 1
a 1
look 1
and 1
shoved 1
along 1
straight 1
for 1
town 1
Well 1
the 1
very 1
first 1
man 1
I 1
see 1
when 1
I 1
got 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
duke 1
He 1
was 1
sticking 1
up 1
a 1
bill 1
for 1
the 1
Royal 1
Nonesuch 1
three 1
night 1
performance 1
like 1
that 1
other 1
time 1
They 1
had 1
the 1
cheek 1
them 1
frauds 1
I 1
was 1
right 1
on 1
him 1
before 1
I 1
could 1
shirk 1
He 1
looked 1
astonished 1
and 1
says 1
Hel 1
lo 1
Where 1
d 1
you 1
come 1
from 1
Then 1
he 1
says 1
kind 1
of 1
glad 1
and 1
eager 1
Where 1
s 1
the 1
raft 1
got 1
her 1
in 1
a 1
good 1
place 1
I 1
says 1
Why 1
that 1
s 1
just 1
what 1
I 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
ask 1
your 1
grace 1
Then 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
look 1
so 1
joyful 1
and 1
says 1
What 1
was 1
your 1
idea 1
for 1
asking 1
me 1
he 1
says 1
Well 1
I 1
says 1
when 1
I 1
see 1
the 1
king 1
in 1
that 1
doggery 1
yesterday 1
I 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
we 1
can 1
t 1
get 1
him 1
home 1
for 1
hours 1
till 1
he 1
s 1
soberer 1
so 1
I 1
went 1
a 1
loafing 1
around 1
town 1
to 1
put 1
in 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
wait 1
A 1
man 1
up 1
and 1
offered 1
me 1
ten 1
cents 1
to 1
help 1
him 1
pull 1
a 1
skiff 1
over 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
back 1
to 1
fetch 1
a 1
sheep 1
and 1
so 1
I 1
went 1
along 1
but 1
when 1
we 1
was 1
dragging 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
boat 1
and 1
the 1
man 1
left 1
me 1
a 1
holt 1
of 1
the 1
rope 1
and 1
went 1
behind 1
him 1
to 1
shove 1
him 1
along 1
he 1
was 1
too 1
strong 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
jerked 1
loose 1
and 1
run 1
and 1
we 1
after 1
him 1
We 1
didn 1
t 1
have 1
no 1
dog 1
and 1
so 1
we 1
had 1
to 1
chase 1
him 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
country 1
till 1
we 1
tired 1
him 1
out 1
We 1
never 1
got 1
him 1
till 1
dark 1
then 1
we 1
fetched 1
him 1
over 1
and 1
I 1
started 1
down 1
for 1
the 1
raft 1
When 1
I 1
got 1
there 1
and 1
see 1
it 1
was 1
gone 1
I 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
They 1
ve 1
got 1
into 1
trouble 1
and 1
had 1
to 1
leave 1
and 1
they 1
ve 1
took 1
my 1
nigger 1
which 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
nigger 1
I 1
ve 1
got 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
now 1
I 1
m 1
in 1
a 1
strange 1
country 1
and 1
ain 1
t 1
got 1
no 1
property 1
no 1
more 1
nor 1
nothing 1
and 1
no 1
way 1
to 1
make 1
my 1
living 1
so 1
I 1
set 1
down 1
and 1
cried 1
I 1
slept 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
all 1
night 1
But 1
what 1
did 1
become 1
of 1
the 1
raft 1
then 1
and 1
Jim 1
poor 1
Jim 1
Blamed 1
if 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
is 1
what 1
s 1
become 1
of 1
the 1
raft 1
That 1
old 1
fool 1
had 1
made 1
a 1
trade 1
and 1
got 1
forty 1
dollars 1
and 1
when 1
we 1
found 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
doggery 1
the 1
loafers 1
had 1
matched 1
half 1
dollars 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
got 1
every 1
cent 1
but 1
what 1
he 1
d 1
spent 1
for 1
whisky 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
got 1
him 1
home 1
late 1
last 1
night 1
and 1
found 1
the 1
raft 1
gone 1
we 1
said 1
That 1
little 1
rascal 1
has 1
stole 1
our 1
raft 1
and 1
shook 1
us 1
and 1
run 1
off 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
shake 1
my 1
nigger 1
would 1
I 1
the 1
only 1
nigger 1
I 1
had 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
the 1
only 1
property 1
We 1
never 1
thought 1
of 1
that 1
Fact 1
is 1
I 1
reckon 1
we 1
d 1
come 1
to 1
consider 1
him 1
our 1
nigger 1
yes 1
we 1
did 1
consider 1
him 1
so 1
goodness 1
knows 1
we 1
had 1
trouble 1
enough 1
for 1
him 1
So 1
when 1
we 1
see 1
the 1
raft 1
was 1
gone 1
and 1
we 1
flat 1
broke 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
anything 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
to 1
try 1
the 1
Royal 1
Nonesuch 1
another 1
shake 1
And 1
I 1
ve 1
pegged 1
along 1
ever 1
since 1
dry 1
as 1
a 1
powder 1
horn 1
Where 1
s 1
that 1
ten 1
cents 1
Give 1
it 1
here 1
I 1
had 1
considerable 1
money 1
so 1
I 1
give 1
him 1
ten 1
cents 1
but 1
begged 1
him 1
to 1
spend 1
it 1
for 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
some 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
the 1
money 1
I 1
had 1
and 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
had 1
nothing 1
to 1
eat 1
since 1
yesterday 1
He 1
never 1
said 1
nothing 1
The 1
next 1
minute 1
he 1
whirls 1
on 1
me 1
and 1
says 1
Do 1
you 1
reckon 1
that 1
nigger 1
would 1
blow 1
on 1
us 1
We 1
d 1
skin 1
him 1
if 1
he 1
done 1
that 1
How 1
can 1
he 1
blow 1
Hain 1
t 1
he 1
run 1
off 1
No 1
That 1
old 1
fool 1
sold 1
him 1
and 1
never 1
divided 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
money 1
s 1
gone 1
Sold 1
him 1
I 1
says 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
cry 1
why 1
he 1
was 1
my 1
nigger 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
my 1
money 1
Where 1
is 1
he 1
I 1
want 1
my 1
nigger 1
Well 1
you 1
can 1
t 1
get 1
your 1
nigger 1
that 1
s 1
all 1
so 1
dry 1
up 1
your 1
blubbering 1
Looky 1
here 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
you 1
d 1
venture 1
to 1
blow 1
on 1
us 1
Blamed 1
if 1
I 1
think 1
I 1
d 1
trust 1
you 1
Why 1
if 1
you 1
was 1
to 1
blow 1
on 1
us 1
He 1
stopped 1
but 1
I 1
never 1
see 1
the 1
duke 1
look 1
so 1
ugly 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
eyes 1
before 1
I 1
went 1
on 1
a 1
whimpering 1
and 1
says 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
blow 1
on 1
nobody 1
and 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
got 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
blow 1
nohow 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
turn 1
out 1
and 1
find 1
my 1
nigger 1
He 1
looked 1
kinder 1
bothered 1
and 1
stood 1
there 1
with 1
his 1
bills 1
fluttering 1
on 1
his 1
arm 1
thinking 1
and 1
wrinkling 1
up 1
his 1
forehead 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
says 1
I 1
ll 1
tell 1
you 1
something 1
We 1
got 1
to 1
be 1
here 1
three 1
days 1
If 1
you 1
ll 1
promise 1
you 1
won 1
t 1
blow 1
and 1
won 1
t 1
let 1
the 1
nigger 1
blow 1
I 1
ll 1
tell 1
you 1
where 1
to 1
find 1
him 1
So 1
I 1
promised 1
and 1
he 1
says 1
A 1
farmer 1
by 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
Silas 1
Ph 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
stopped 1
You 1
see 1
he 1
started 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
the 1
truth 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
stopped 1
that 1
way 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
study 1
and 1
think 1
again 1
I 1
reckoned 1
he 1
was 1
changing 1
his 1
mind 1
And 1
so 1
he 1
was 1
He 1
wouldn 1
t 1
trust 1
me 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
make 1
sure 1
of 1
having 1
me 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
the 1
whole 1
three 1
days 1
So 1
pretty 1
soon 1
he 1
says 1
The 1
man 1
that 1
bought 1
him 1
is 1
named 1
Abram 1
Foster 1
Abram 1
G 1
Foster 1
and 1
he 1
lives 1
forty 1
mile 1
back 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
on 1
the 1
road 1
to 1
Lafayette 1
All 1
right 1
I 1
says 1
I 1
can 1
walk 1
it 1
in 1
three 1
days 1
And 1
I 1
ll 1
start 1
this 1
very 1
afternoon 1
No 1
you 1
wont 1
you 1
ll 1
start 1
now 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
lose 1
any 1
time 1
about 1
it 1
neither 1
nor 1
do 1
any 1
gabbling 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
Just 1
keep 1
a 1
tight 1
tongue 1
in 1
your 1
head 1
and 1
move 1
right 1
along 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
won 1
t 1
get 1
into 1
trouble 1
with 1
us 1
d 1
ye 1
hear 1
That 1
was 1
the 1
order 1
I 1
wanted 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
one 1
I 1
played 1
for 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
be 1
left 1
free 1
to 1
work 1
my 1
plans 1
So 1
clear 1
out 1
he 1
says 1
and 1
you 1
can 1
tell 1
Mr 1
Foster 1
whatever 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
Maybe 1
you 1
can 1
get 1
him 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
Jim 1
is 1
your 1
nigger 1
some 1
idiots 1
don 1
t 1
require 1
documents 1
leastways 1
I 1
ve 1
heard 1
there 1
s 1
such 1
down 1
South 1
here 1
And 1
when 1
you 1
tell 1
him 1
the 1
handbill 1
and 1
the 1
reward 1
s 1
bogus 1
maybe 1
he 1
ll 1
believe 1
you 1
when 1
you 1
explain 1
to 1
him 1
what 1
the 1
idea 1
was 1
for 1
getting 1
em 1
out 1
Go 1
long 1
now 1
and 1
tell 1
him 1
anything 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
but 1
mind 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
work 1
your 1
jaw 1
any 1
between 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
So 1
I 1
left 1
and 1
struck 1
for 1
the 1
back 1
country 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
look 1
around 1
but 1
I 1
kinder 1
felt 1
like 1
he 1
was 1
watching 1
me 1
But 1
I 1
knowed 1
I 1
could 1
tire 1
him 1
out 1
at 1
that 1
I 1
went 1
straight 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
a 1
mile 1
before 1
I 1
stopped 1
then 1
I 1
doubled 1
back 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
towards 1
Phelps 1
I 1
reckoned 1
I 1
better 1
start 1
in 1
on 1
my 1
plan 1
straight 1
off 1
without 1
fooling 1
around 1
because 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
stop 1
Jim 1
s 1
mouth 1
till 1
these 1
fellows 1
could 1
get 1
away 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
no 1
trouble 1
with 1
their 1
kind 1
I 1
d 1
seen 1
all 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
get 1
entirely 1
shut 1
of 1
them 1
CHAPTER 1
XXXII 1
WHEN 1
I 1
got 1
there 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
still 1
and 1
Sunday 1
like 1
and 1
hot 1
and 1
sunshiny 1
the 1
hands 1
was 1
gone 1
to 1
the 1
fields 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
them 1
kind 1
of 1
faint 1
dronings 1
of 1
bugs 1
and 1
flies 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
that 1
makes 1
it 1
seem 1
so 1
lonesome 1
and 1
like 1
everybody 1
s 1
dead 1
and 1
gone 1
and 1
if 1
a 1
breeze 1
fans 1
along 1
and 1
quivers 1
the 1
leaves 1
it 1
makes 1
you 1
feel 1
mournful 1
because 1
you 1
feel 1
like 1
it 1
s 1
spirits 1
whispering 1
spirits 1
that 1
s 1
been 1
dead 1
ever 1
so 1
many 1
years 1
and 1
you 1
always 1
think 1
they 1
re 1
talking 1
about 1
you 1
As 1
a 1
general 1
thing 1
it 1
makes 1
a 1
body 1
wish 1
he 1
was 1
dead 1
too 1
and 1
done 1
with 1
it 1
all 1
Phelps 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
little 1
one 1
horse 1
cotton 1
plantations 1
and 1
they 1
all 1
look 1
alike 1
A 1
rail 1
fence 1
round 1
a 1
two 1
acre 1
yard 1
a 1
stile 1
made 1
out 1
of 1
logs 1
sawed 1
off 1
and 1
up 1
ended 1
in 1
steps 1
like 1
barrels 1
of 1
a 1
different 1
length 1
to 1
climb 1
over 1
the 1
fence 1
with 1
and 1
for 1
the 1
women 1
to 1
stand 1
on 1
when 1
they 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
jump 1
on 1
to 1
a 1
horse 1
some 1
sickly 1
grass 1
patches 1
in 1
the 1
big 1
yard 1
but 1
mostly 1
it 1
was 1
bare 1
and 1
smooth 1
like 1
an 1
old 1
hat 1
with 1
the 1
nap 1
rubbed 1
off 1
big 1
double 1
log 1
house 1
for 1
the 1
white 1
folks 1
hewed 1
logs 1
with 1
the 1
chinks 1
stopped 1
up 1
with 1
mud 1
or 1
mortar 1
and 1
these 1
mud 1
stripes 1
been 1
whitewashed 1
some 1
time 1
or 1
another 1
round 1
log 1
kitchen 1
with 1
a 1
big 1
broad 1
open 1
but 1
roofed 1
passage 1
joining 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
log 1
smoke 1
house 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
kitchen 1
three 1
little 1
log 1
nigger 1
cabins 1
in 1
a 1
row 1
t 1
other 1
side 1
the 1
smoke 1
house 1
one 1
little 1
hut 1
all 1
by 1
itself 1
away 1
down 1
against 1
the 1
back 1
fence 1
and 1
some 1
outbuildings 1
down 1
a 1
piece 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
ash 1
hopper 1
and 1
big 1
kettle 1
to 1
bile 1
soap 1
in 1
by 1
the 1
little 1
hut 1
bench 1
by 1
the 1
kitchen 1
door 1
with 1
bucket 1
of 1
water 1
and 1
a 1
gourd 1
hound 1
asleep 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
more 1
hounds 1
asleep 1
round 1
about 2
three 1
shade 1
trees 1
away 1
off 1
in 1
a 1
corner 1
some 1
currant 1
bushes 1
and 1
gooseberry 1
bushes 1
in 1
one 1
place 1
by 1
the 1
fence 1
outside 1
of 1
the 1
fence 1
a 1
garden 1
and 1
a 1
watermelon 1
patch 1
then 1
the 1
cotton 1
fields 1
begins 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
fields 1
the 1
woods 1
I 1
went 1
around 1
and 1
clumb 1
over 1
the 1
back 1
stile 1
by 1
the 1
ash 1
hopper 1
and 1
started 1
for 1
the 1
kitchen 1
When 1
I 1
got 1
a 1
little 1
ways 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
dim 1
hum 1
of 1
a 1
spinning 1
wheel 1
wailing 1
along 1
up 1
and 1
sinking 1
along 1
down 1
again 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
knowed 1
for 1
certain 1
I 1
wished 1
I 1
was 1
dead 1
for 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
lonesomest 1
sound 1
in 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
I 1
went 1
right 1
along 1
not 1
fixing 1
up 1
any 1
particular 1
plan 1
but 1
just 1
trusting 1
to 1
Providence 1
to 1
put 1
the 1
right 1
words 1
in 1
my 1
mouth 1
when 1
the 1
time 1
come 1
for 1
I 1
d 1
noticed 1
that 1
Providence 1
always 1
did 1
put 1
the 1
right 1
words 1
in 1
my 1
mouth 1
if 1
I 1
left 1
it 1
alone 1
When 1
I 1
got 1
half 1
way 1
first 1
one 1
hound 1
and 1
then 1
another 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
I 1
stopped 1
and 1
faced 1
them 1
and 1
kept 1
still 1
And 1
such 1
another 1
powwow 1
as 1
they 1
made 1
In 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
minute 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
hub 1
of 1
a 1
wheel 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
say 1
spokes 1
made 1
out 1
of 1
dogs 1
circle 1
of 1
fifteen 1
of 1
them 1
packed 1
together 1
around 1
me 1
with 1
their 1
necks 1
and 1
noses 1
stretched 1
up 1
towards 1
me 1
a 1
barking 1
and 1
howling 1
and 1
more 1
a 1
coming 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
them 1
sailing 1
over 1
fences 1
and 1
around 1
corners 1
from 1
everywheres 1
A 1
nigger 1
woman 1
come 1
tearing 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
kitchen 1
with 1
a 1
rolling 1
pin 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
singing 1
out 1
Begone 1
you 1
Tige 1
you 1
Spot 1
begone 1
sah 1
and 1
she 1
fetched 1
first 1
one 1
and 1
then 1
another 1
of 1
them 1
a 1
clip 1
and 1
sent 1
them 1
howling 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
rest 1
followed 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
second 1
half 1
of 1
them 1
come 1
back 1
wagging 1
their 1
tails 1
around 1
me 1
and 1
making 1
friends 1
with 1
me 1
There 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
harm 1
in 1
a 1
hound 1
nohow 1
And 1
behind 1
the 1
woman 1
comes 1
a 1
little 1
nigger 1
girl 1
and 1
two 1
little 1
nigger 1
boys 1
without 1
anything 1
on 1
but 1
tow 1
linen 1
shirts 1
and 1
they 1
hung 1
on 1
to 1
their 1
mother 1
s 1
gown 1
and 1
peeped 1
out 1
from 1
behind 1
her 1
at 1
me 1
bashful 1
the 1
way 1
they 1
always 1
do 1
And 1
here 1
comes 1
the 1
white 1
woman 1
running 1
from 1
the 1
house 1
about 1
forty 1
five 1
or 1
fifty 1
year 1
old 1
bareheaded 1
and 1
her 1
spinning 1
stick 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
and 1
behind 1
her 1
comes 1
her 1
little 1
white 1
children 1
acting 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
the 1
little 1
niggers 1
was 1
doing 1
She 1
was 1
smiling 1
all 1
over 1
so 1
she 1
could 1
hardly 1
stand 1
and 1
says 1
It 1
s 1
you 1
at 1
last 1
ain 1
t 1
it 1
I 1
out 1
with 1
a 1
Yes 1
m 1
before 1
I 1
thought 1
She 1
grabbed 1
me 1
and 1
hugged 1
me 1
tight 1
and 1
then 1
gripped 1
me 1
by 1
both 1
hands 1
and 1
shook 1
and 1
shook 1
and 1
the 1
tears 1
come 1
in 1
her 1
eyes 1
and 1
run 1
down 1
over 1
and 1
she 1
couldn 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
hug 1
and 1
shake 1
enough 1
and 1
kept 1
saying 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
look 1
as 1
much 1
like 1
your 1
mother 1
as 1
I 1
reckoned 1
you 1
would 1
but 1
law 1
sakes 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
for 1
that 1
I 1
m 1
so 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
Dear 1
dear 1
it 1
does 1
seem 1
like 1
I 1
could 1
eat 1
you 1
up 1
Children 1
it 1
s 1
your 1
cousin 1
Tom 1
tell 1
him 1
howdy 1
But 1
they 1
ducked 1
their 1
heads 1
and 1
put 1
their 1
fingers 1
in 1
their 1
mouths 1
and 1
hid 1
behind 1
her 1
So 1
she 1
run 1
on 1
Lize 1
hurry 1
up 1
and 1
get 1
him 1
a 1
hot 1
breakfast 1
right 1
away 1
or 1
did 1
you 1
get 1
your 1
breakfast 1
on 1
the 1
boat 1
I 1
said 1
I 1
had 1
got 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
boat 1
So 1
then 1
she 1
started 1
for 1
the 1
house 1
leading 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
the 1
children 1
tagging 1
after 1
When 1
we 1
got 1
there 1
she 1
set 1
me 1
down 1
in 1
a 1
split 1
bottomed 1
chair 1
and 1
set 1
herself 1
down 1
on 1
a 1
little 1
low 1
stool 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
me 1
holding 1
both 1
of 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
says 1
Now 1
I 1
can 1
have 1
a 1
good 1
look 1
at 1
you 1
and 1
laws 1
a 1
me 1
I 1
ve 1
been 1
hungry 1
for 1
it 1
a 1
many 1
and 1
a 1
many 1
a 1
time 1
all 1
these 1
long 1
years 1
and 1
it 1
s 1
come 1
at 1
last 1
We 1
been 1
expecting 1
you 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
days 1
and 1
more 1
What 1
kep 1
you 1
boat 1
get 1
aground 1
Yes 1
m 1
she 1
Don 1
t 1
say 1
yes 1
m 1
say 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
Where 1
d 1
she 1
get 1
aground 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
rightly 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
because 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
whether 1
the 1
boat 1
would 1
be 1
coming 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
or 1
down 1
But 1
I 1
go 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
on 1
instinct 1
and 1
my 1
instinct 1
said 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
coming 1
up 1
from 1
down 1
towards 1
Orleans 1
That 1
didn 1
t 1
help 1
me 1
much 1
though 1
for 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
bars 1
down 1
that 1
way 1
I 1
see 1
I 1
d 1
got 1
to 1
invent 1
a 1
bar 1
or 1
forget 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
one 1
we 1
got 1
aground 1
on 1
or 1
Now 1
I 1
struck 1
an 1
idea 1
and 1
fetched 1
it 1
out 1
It 1
warn 1
t 1
the 1
grounding 1
that 1
didn 1
t 1
keep 1
us 1
back 1
but 1
a 1
little 1
We 1
blowed 1
out 1
a 1
cylinder 1
head 1
Good 1
gracious 1
anybody 1
hurt 1
No 1
m 1
Killed 1
a 1
nigger 1
Well 1
it 1
s 1
lucky 1
because 1
sometimes 1
people 1
do 1
get 1
hurt 1
Two 1
years 1
ago 1
last 1
Christmas 1
your 1
uncle 1
Silas 1
was 1
coming 1
up 1
from 1
Newrleans 1
on 1
the 1
old 1
Lally 1
Rook 1
and 1
she 1
blowed 1
out 1
a 1
cylinder 1
head 1
and 1
crippled 1
a 1
man 1
And 1
I 1
think 1
he 1
died 1
afterwards 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
Baptist 1
Your 1
uncle 1
Silas 1
knowed 1
a 1
family 1
in 1
Baton 1
Rouge 1
that 1
knowed 1
his 1
people 1
very 1
well 1
Yes 1
I 1
remember 1
now 1
he 1
did 1
die 1
Mortification 1
set 1
in 1
and 1
they 1
had 1
to 1
amputate 1
him 1
But 1
it 1
didn 1
t 1
save 1
him 1
Yes 1
it 1
was 1
mortification 1
that 1
was 1
it 1
He 1
turned 1
blue 1
all 1
over 1
and 1
died 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
a 1
glorious 1
resurrection 1
They 1
say 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
sight 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
Your 1
uncle 1
s 1
been 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
town 1
every 1
day 1
to 1
fetch 1

beaming 1
and 1

smiling 1
like 1

and 1
I 1
standing 1
pretty 1
meek 1
and 1
sweaty 1
alongside 1
The 1

s 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
By 1
jings 1
I 1
most 1
slumped 1
through 1
the 1
floor 1
But 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
swap 1
knives 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
grabbed 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
shook 1
and 1
kept 1
on 1
shaking 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
how 1
the 1
woman 1
did 1
dance 1
around 1
and 1
laugh 1
and 1
cry 1
and 1
then 1
how 1
they 1
both 1
did 1
fire 1
off 1
questions 1
about 1
Sid 1
and 1
Mary 1
and 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
tribe 1
But 1
if 1
they 1
was 1
joyful 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
nothing 1
to 1
what 1
I 1
was 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
like 1
being 1
born 1
again 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
glad 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
who 1
I 1
was 1
Well 1
they 1
froze 1
to 1
me 1
for 1
two 1
hours 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
when 1
my 1
chin 1
was 1
so 1
tired 1
it 1
couldn 1
t 1
hardly 1
go 1
any 1
more 1
I 1
had 1
told 1
them 1
more 1
about 1
my 1
family 1
I 1
mean 1
the 1
Sawyer 1
family 1
than 1
ever 1
happened 1
to 1
any 1
six 1
Sawyer 1
families 1
And 1
I 1
explained 1
all 1
about 1
how 1
we 1
blowed 1
out 1
a 1
cylinder 1
head 1
at 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
White 1
River 1
and 1
it 1
took 1
us 1
three 1
days 1
to 1
fix 1
it 1
Which 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
worked 1
first 1
rate 1
because 1
they 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
but 1
what 1
it 1
would 1
take 1
three 1
days 1
to 1
fix 1
it 1
If 1
I 1
d 1
a 1
called 1
it 1
a 1
bolthead 1
it 1
would 1
a 1
done 1
just 1
as 1
well 1
Now 1
I 1
was 1
feeling 1
pretty 1
comfortable 1
all 1
down 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
pretty 1
uncomfortable 1
all 1
up 1
the 1
other 1
Being 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
was 1
easy 1
and 1
comfortable 1
and 1
it 1
stayed 1
easy 1
and 1
comfortable 1
till 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
I 1
hear 1
a 1
steamboat 1
coughing 1
along 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
Then 1
I 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
s 1
pose 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
comes 1
down 1
on 1
that 1
boat 1
And 1
s 1
pose 1
he 1
steps 1
in 1
here 1
any 1
minute 1
and 1
sings 1
out 1
my 1
name 1
before 1
I 1
can 1
throw 1
him 1
a 1
wink 1
to 1
keep 1
quiet 1
Well 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
have 1
it 1
that 1
way 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
do 1
at 1
all 1
I 1
must 1
go 1
up 1
the 1
road 1
and 1
waylay 1
him 1
So 1
I 1
told 1
the 1
folks 1
I 1
reckoned 1
I 1
would 1
go 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
fetch 1
down 1
my 1
baggage 1
The 1
old 1
gentleman 1
was 1
for 1
going 1
along 1
with 1
me 1
but 1
I 1
said 1
no 1
I 1
could 1
drive 1
the 1
horse 1
myself 1
and 1
I 1
druther 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
take 1
no 1
trouble 1
about 1
me 1
CHAPTER 1
XXXIII 1
SO 1
I 1
started 1
for 1
town 1
in 1
the 1
wagon 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
half 1
way 1
I 1
see 1
a 1
wagon 1
coming 1
and 1
sure 1
enough 1
it 1
was 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
and 1
I 1
stopped 1
and 1
waited 1
till 1
he 1
come 1
along 1
I 1
says 1
Hold 1
on 1
and 1
it 1
stopped 1
alongside 1
and 1
his 1
mouth 1
opened 1
up 1
like 1
a 1
trunk 1
and 1
stayed 1
so 1
and 1
he 1
swallowed 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
times 1
like 1
a 1
person 1
that 1
s 1
got 1
a 1
dry 1
throat 1
and 1
then 1
says 1
I 1
hain 1
t 1
ever 1
done 1
you 1
no 1
harm 1
You 1
know 1
that 1
So 1
then 1
what 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
ha 1
nt 1
me 1
for 1
I 1
says 1
I 1
hain 1
t 1
come 1
back 1
I 1
hain 1
t 1
been 1
gone 1
When 1
he 1
heard 1
my 1
voice 1
it 1
righted 1
him 1
up 1
some 1
but 1
he 1
warn 1
t 1
quite 1
satisfied 1
yet 1
He 1
says 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
play 1
nothing 1
on 1
me 1
because 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
on 1
you 1
Honest 1
injun 1
now 1
you 1
ain 1
t 1
a 1
ghost 1
Honest 1
injun 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
I 1
says 1
Well 1
I 2
well 1
that 1
ought 1
to 1
settle 1
it 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
somehow 1
seem 1
to 1
understand 1
it 1
no 1
way 1
Looky 1
here 1
warn 1
t 1
you 1
ever 1
murdered 1
at 1
all 1
No 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
ever 1
murdered 1
at 1
all 1
I 1
played 1
it 1
on 1
them 1
You 1
come 1
in 1
here 1
and 1
feel 1
of 1
me 1
if 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
believe 1
me 1
So 1
he 1
done 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
satisfied 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
that 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
again 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
And 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
right 1
off 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
grand 1
adventure 1
and 1
mysterious 1
and 1
so 1
it 1
hit 1
him 1
where 1
he 1
lived 1
But 1
I 1
said 1
leave 1
it 1
alone 1
till 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
told 1
his 1
driver 1
to 1
wait 1
and 1
we 1
drove 1
off 1
a 1
little 1
piece 1
and 1
I 1
told 1
him 1
the 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
fix 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
and 1
what 1
did 1
he 1
reckon 1
we 1
better 1
do 1
He 1
said 1
let 1
him 1
alone 1
a 1
minute 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
disturb 1
him 1
So 1
he 1
thought 1
and 1
thought 1
and 1
pretty 1
soon 1
he 1
says 1
It 1
s 1
all 1
right 1
I 1
ve 1
got 1
it 1
Take 1
my 1
trunk 1

and 1
you 1
turn 1
back 1
and 1
fool 1
along 1
slow 1
so 1
as 1
to 1

about 1
the 1
time 1
you 1
ought 1
to 1
and 1
I 1
ll 1
go 1
towards 1
town 1
a 1
piece 1
and 1
take 1
a 1
fresh 1

and 1

a 1
quarter 1
or 1
a 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
after 1
you 1
and 1
you 1
needn 1
t 1
let 1
on 1
to 1
know 1
me 1
at 1
first 1
I 1
says 1
All 1

but 1
wait 1
a 1
minute 1
There 1
s 1
one 1
more 1
thing 1
a 1
thing 1

And 1

He 1

I 1

low 1
down 1
and 1

m 1
a 1
going 1
to 1

and 1
I 1

Will 1

His 1
eye 1
lit 1
up 1
and 1
he 1
says 1
I 1
ll 1
help 1
you 1
steal 1
him 1
Well 1
I 1
let 1
go 1
all 1
holts 1
then 1
like 1
I 1
was 1
shot 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
astonishing 1
speech 1
I 1
ever 1
heard 1
and 1
I 1
m 1
bound 1
to 1
say 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
fell 1
considerable 1
in 1
my 1
estimation 1
Only 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
believe 1
it 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
a 1
nigger 1
stealer 1
Oh 1
shucks 1
I 1
says 1
you 1
re 1
joking 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
joking 1
either 1
Well 1
then 1
I 1
says 1
joking 1
or 1
no 1
joking 1
if 1
you 1
hear 1
anything 1
said 1
about 1
a 1
runaway 1
nigger 1
don 1
t 1
forget 1
to 1
remember 1
that 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
nothing 1
about 1
him 1
and 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
nothing 1
about 1
him 1
Then 1
we 1
took 1
the 1
trunk 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
in 1
my 1
wagon 1
and 1
he 1
drove 1
off 1
his 1
way 1
and 1
I 1
drove 1
mine 1
But 1
of 1
course 1
I 1
forgot 1
all 1
about 1
driving 1
slow 1
on 1
accounts 1
of 1
being 1
glad 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
thinking 1
so 1
I 1
got 1
home 1
a 1
heap 1
too 1
quick 1
for 1
that 1
length 1
of 1
a 1
trip 1
The 1
old 1
gentleman 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
he 1
says 1
Why 1
this 1
is 1
wonderful 1
Whoever 1
would 1
a 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
that 1
mare 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
I 1
wish 1
we 1
d 1
a 1
timed 1
her 1
And 1
she 1
hain 1
t 1
sweated 1
a 1
hair 1
not 1
a 1
hair 1
It 1
s 1
wonderful 1
Why 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
take 1
a 1
hundred 1
dollars 1
for 1
that 1
horse 1
now 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
honest 1
and 1
yet 1
I 1
d 1
a 1
sold 1
her 1
for 1
fifteen 1
before 1
and 1
thought 1
twas 1
all 1
she 1
was 1
worth 1
That 1
s 1
all 1
he 1
said 1
He 1
was 1
the 1
innocentest 1
best 1
old 1
soul 1
I 1
ever 1
see 1
But 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
surprising 1
because 1
he 1
warn 1
t 1
only 1
just 1
a 1
farmer 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
preacher 1
too 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
little 1
one 1
horse 1
log 1
church 1
down 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
plantation 1
which 1
he 1
built 1
it 1
himself 1
at 1
his 1
own 1
expense 1
for 1
a 1
church 1
and 1
schoolhouse 1
and 1
never 1
charged 1
nothing 1
for 1
his 1
preaching 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
worth 1
it 1
too 1
There 1
was 1
plenty 1
other 1
farmer 1
preachers 1
like 1
that 1
and 1
done 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
down 1
South 1
In 1
about 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
Tom 1

the 1
front 1
stile 1
and 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
she 1
see 1
it 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
because 1
it 1

about 1
fifty 1
yards 1
and 1
says 1
Why 1

Everybody 1

river 1

first 1
rate 1
surprise 1
for 1

here 1
to 1

Well 1

smack 1
We 1
had 1
dinner 1

in 1

broad 1
open 1
passage 1
betwixt 1
the 1
house 1
and 1

kitchen 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
things 1
enough 1
on 1
that 1
table 1
for 1
seven 1
families 1
and 1
all 1
hot 1
too 1
none 1
of 1
your 1
flabby 1
tough 1
meat 1
that 1
s 1
laid 1
in 1
a 1
cupboard 1
in 1
a 1
damp 1
cellar 1
all 1
night 1
and 1
tastes 1
like 1
a 1
hunk 1
of 1
old 1
cold 1
cannibal 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
Uncle 1
Silas 1
he 1
asked 1
a 1
pretty 1
long 1
blessing 1
over 1
it 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
worth 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
didn 1
t 1
cool 1
it 1
a 1
bit 1
neither 1
the 1
way 1
I 1
ve 1
seen 1
them 1
kind 1
of 1
interruptions 1
do 1
lots 1
of 1
times 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
considerable 1
good 1
deal 1
of 1
talk 1
all 1
the 1
afternoon 1
and 1
me 1
and 1
Tom 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
lookout 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
but 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
use 1
they 1
didn 1
t 1
happen 1
to 1
say 1
nothing 1
about 1
any 1
runaway 1
nigger 1
and 1
we 1
was 1
afraid 1
to 1
try 1
to 1
work 1
up 1
to 1
it 1
But 1
at 1
supper 1
at 1
night 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
boys 1
says 1
Pa 1
mayn 1
t 1
Tom 1
and 1
Sid 1
and 1
me 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
show 1
No 1
says 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
I 1
reckon 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
any 1
and 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
go 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
because 1
the 1
runaway 1
nigger 1
told 1
Burton 1
and 1
me 1
all 1
about 1
that 1
scandalous 1
show 1
and 1
Burton 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
tell 1
the 1
people 1
so 1
I 1
reckon 1
they 1
ve 1
drove 1
the 1
owdacious 1
loafers 1
out 1
of 1
town 1
before 1
this 1
time 1
So 1
there 1
it 1
was 1
but 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
help 1
it 1
Tom 1
and 1
me 1
was 1
to 1
sleep 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
room 1
and 1
bed 1
so 1
being 1
tired 1
we 1
bid 1
good 1
night 1
and 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
bed 1
right 1
after 1
supper 1
and 1
clumb 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
lightning 1
rod 1
and 1
shoved 1
for 1
the 1
town 1
for 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
believe 1
anybody 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
give 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
a 1
hint 1
and 1
so 1
if 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
hurry 1
up 1
and 1
give 1
them 1
one 1
they 1
d 1
get 1
into 1
trouble 1
sure 1
On 1
the 1
road 1
Tom 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
all 1
about 1
how 1
it 1
was 1
reckoned 1
I 1
was 1
murdered 1
and 1
how 1
pap 1
disappeared 1
pretty 1
soon 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
come 1
back 1
no 1
more 1
and 1
what 1
a 1
stir 1
there 1
was 1
when 1
Jim 1
run 1
away 1
and 1
I 1
told 1
Tom 1
all 1
about 1
our 1
Royal 1
Nonesuch 1
rapscallions 1
and 1
as 1
much 1
of 1
the 1
raft 1
voyage 1
as 1
I 1
had 1
time 1
to 1
and 1
as 1
we 1
struck 1
into 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
up 1
through 1
the 2
middle 1
of 1
it 2
was 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
half 1
after 1
eight 1
then 1
here 1
comes 1
a 1
raging 1
rush 1
of 1
people 1
with 1
torches 1
and 1
an 1
awful 1
whooping 1
and 1
yelling 1
and 1
banging 1
tin 1
pans 1
and 1
blowing 1
horns 1
and 1
we 1
jumped 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
to 1
let 1
them 1
go 1
by 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
went 1
by 1
I 1
see 1
they 1
had 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
astraddle 1
of 1
a 1
rail 1
that 1
is 1
I 1
knowed 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
king 1
and 1
the 1
duke 1
though 1
they 1
was 1
all 1
over 1
tar 1
and 1
feathers 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
look 1
like 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
that 1
was 1
human 1
just 1
looked 1
like 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
monstrous 1
big 1
soldier 1
plumes 1
Well 1
it 1
made 1
me 1
sick 1
to 1
see 1
it 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
sorry 1
for 1
them 1
poor 1
pitiful 1
rascals 1
it 1
seemed 1
like 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
ever 1
feel 1
any 1
hardness 1
against 1
them 1
any 1
more 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
dreadful 1
thing 1
to 1
see 1
Human 1
beings 1
can 1
be 1
awful 1
cruel 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
We 1
see 1
we 1
was 1
too 1
late 1
couldn 1
t 1
do 1
no 1
good 1
We 1
asked 1
some 1
stragglers 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
they 1
said 1
everybody 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
show 1
looking 1
very 1
innocent 1
and 1
laid 1
low 1
and 1
kept 1
dark 1
till 1
the 1
poor 1
old 1
king 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
his 1
cavortings 1
on 1
the 1
stage 1
then 1
somebody 1
give 1
a 1
signal 1
and 1
the 1
house 1
rose 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
for 1
them 1
So 1
we 1
poked 1
along 1
back 1
home 1
and 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
feeling 1
so 1
brash 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
before 1
but 1
kind 1
of 1
ornery 1
and 1
humble 1
and 1
to 1
blame 1
somehow 1
though 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
done 1
nothing 1
But 1
that 1
s 1
always 1
the 1
way 1
it 1
don 1
t 1
make 1
no 1
difference 1
whether 1
you 1
do 1
right 1
or 1
wrong 1
a 1
person 1
s 1
conscience 1
ain 1
t 1
got 1
no 1
sense 1
and 1
just 1
goes 1
for 1
him 1
anyway 1
If 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
yaller 1
dog 1
that 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
person 1
s 1
conscience 1
does 1
I 1
would 1
pison 1
him 1
It 1
takes 1
up 1
more 1
room 1
than 1
all 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
a 1
person 1
s 1
insides 1
and 1
yet 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
good 1
nohow 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
he 1
says 1
the 1
same 1
CHAPTER 1
XXXIV 1
WE 1
stopped 1
talking 1
and 1
got 1
to 1
thinking 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
Tom 1
says 1
Looky 1
here 1
Huck 1
what 1
fools 1
we 1
are 1
to 1
not 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
before 1
I 1
bet 1
I 1
know 1
where 1
Jim 1
is 1
No 1
Where 1
In 1
that 1
hut 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
ash 1
hopper 1
Why 1
looky 1
here 1
When 1
we 1
was 1
at 1
dinner 1
didn 1
t 1
you 1
see 1
a 1
nigger 1
man 1
go 1
in 1
there 1
with 1
some 1
vittles 1
Yes 1
What 1
did 1
you 1
think 1
the 1
vittles 1
was 1
for 1
For 1
a 1
dog 1
So 1
d 1
I 1
Well 1
it 1
wasn 1
t 1
for 1
a 1
dog 1
Why 1
Because 1
part 1
of 1
it 1
was 1
watermelon 1
So 1
it 1
was 1
I 1
noticed 1
it 1
Well 1
it 1
does 1
beat 1
all 1
that 1
I 1
never 1
thought 1
about 1
a 1
dog 1
not 1
eating 1
watermelon 1
It 1
shows 1
how 1
a 1
body 1
can 1
see 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
see 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
Well 1
the 1
nigger 1
unlocked 1
the 1
padlock 1
when 1
he 1
went 1
in 1
and 1
he 1
locked 1
it 1
again 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
out 1
He 1
fetched 1
uncle 1
a 1
key 1
about 1
the 1
time 1
we 1
got 1
up 1
from 1
table 1
same 1
key 1
I 1
bet 1
Watermelon 1
shows 1
man 1
lock 1
shows 1
prisoner 1
and 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
likely 1
there 1
s 1
two 1
prisoners 1
on 1
such 1
a 1
little 1
plantation 1
and 1
where 1
the 1
people 1
s 1
all 1
so 1
kind 1
and 1
good 1
Jim 1
s 1
the 1
prisoner 1
All 1
right 1
I 1
m 1
glad 1
we 1
found 1
it 1
out 1
detective 1
fashion 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
give 1
shucks 1
for 1
any 1
other 1
way 1
Now 1
you 1
work 1
your 1
mind 1
and 1
study 1
out 1
a 1
plan 1
to 1
steal 1
Jim 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
study 1
out 1
one 1
too 1
and 1
we 1
ll 1
take 1
the 1
one 1
we 1
like 1
the 1
best 1
What 1
a 1
head 1
for 1
just 1
a 1
boy 1
to 1
have 1
If 1
I 1
had 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
s 1
head 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
trade 1
it 1
off 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
duke 1
nor 1
mate 1
of 1
a 1
steamboat 1
nor 1
clown 1
in 1
a 1
circus 1
nor 1
nothing 1
I 1
can 1
think 1
of 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
thinking 1
out 1
a 1
plan 1
but 1
only 1
just 1
to 1
be 1
doing 1
something 1
I 1
knowed 1
very 1
well 1
where 1
the 1
right 1
plan 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
come 1
from 1
Pretty 1
soon 1
Tom 1
says 1
Ready 1
Yes 1
I 1
says 1
All 1
right 1
bring 1
it 1
out 1
My 1
plan 1
is 1
this 1
I 1
says 1
We 1
can 1
easy 1
find 1
out 1
if 1
it 1
s 1
Jim 1
in 1
there 1
Then 1
get 1
up 1
my 1
canoe 1
to 1
morrow 1
night 1
and 1
fetch 1
my 1
raft 1
over 1
from 1
the 1
island 1
Then 1
the 1
first 1
dark 1
night 1
that 1
comes 1
steal 1
the 1
key 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
s 1
britches 1
after 1
he 1
goes 1
to 1
bed 1
and 1
shove 1
off 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
on 1
the 1
raft 1
with 1
Jim 1
hiding 1
daytimes 1
and 1
running 1
nights 1
the 1
way 1
me 1
and 1
Jim 1
used 1
to 1
do 1
before 1
Wouldn 1
t 1
that 1
plan 1
work 1
Work 1
Why 1
cert 1
nly 1
it 1
would 1
work 1
like 1
rats 1
a 1
fighting 1
But 1
it 1
s 1
too 1
blame 1
simple 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
nothing 1
to 1
it 1
What 1
s 1
the 1
good 1
of 1
a 1
plan 1
that 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
more 1
trouble 1
than 1
that 1
It 1
s 1
as 1
mild 1
as 1
goose 1
milk 1
Why 1
Huck 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
make 1
no 1
more 1
talk 1
than 1
breaking 1
into 1
a 1
soap 1
factory 1
I 1
never 1
said 1
nothing 1
because 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
expecting 1
nothing 1
different 1
but 1
I 1
knowed 1
mighty 1
well 1
that 1
whenever 1
he 1
got 1
his 1
plan 1
ready 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
have 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
objections 1
to 1
it 1
And 1
it 1
didn 1
t 1
He 1
told 1
me 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
and 1
I 1
see 1
in 1
a 1
minute 1
it 1
was 1
worth 1
fifteen 1
of 1
mine 1
for 1
style 1
and 1
would 1
make 1
Jim 1
just 1
as 1
free 1
a 1
man 1
as 1
mine 1
would 1
and 1
maybe 1
get 1
us 1
all 1
killed 1
besides 1
So 1
I 1
was 1
satisfied 1
and 1
said 1
we 1
would 1
waltz 1
in 1
on 1
it 1
I 1
needn 1
t 1
tell 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
here 1
because 1
I 1
knowed 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
stay 1
the 1
way 1
it 1
was 1
I 1
knowed 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
changing 1
it 1
around 1
every 1
which 1
way 1
as 1
we 1
went 1
along 1
and 1
heaving 1
in 1
new 1
bullinesses 1
wherever 1
he 1
got 1
a 1
chance 1
And 1
that 1
is 1
what 1
he 1
done 1
Well 1
one 1
thing 1
was 1
dead 1
sure 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
that 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
was 1
in 1
earnest 1
and 1
was 1
actuly 1
going 1
to 1
help 1
steal 1
that 1
nigger 1
out 1
of 1
slavery 1
That 1
was 1
the 1
thing 1
that 1
was 1
too 1
many 1
for 1
me 1
Here 1
was 1
a 1
boy 1
that 1
was 1
respectable 1
and 1
well 1
brung 1
up 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
character 1
to 1
lose 1
and 1
folks 1
at 1
home 1
that 1
had 1
characters 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
bright 1
and 1
not 1
leather 1
headed 1
and 1
knowing 1
and 1
not 1
ignorant 1
and 1
not 1
mean 1
but 1
kind 1
and 1
yet 1
here 1
he 1
was 1
without 1
any 1
more 1
pride 1
or 1
rightness 1
or 1
feeling 1
than 1
to 1
stoop 1
to 1
this 1
business 1
and 1
make 1
himself 1
a 1
shame 1
and 1
his 1
family 1
a 1
shame 1
before 1
everybody 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
understand 1
it 1
no 1
way 1
at 1
all 1
It 1
was 1
outrageous 1
and 1
I 1
knowed 1
I 1
ought 1
to 1
just 1
up 1
and 1
tell 1
him 1
so 1
and 1
so 1
be 1
his 1
true 1
friend 1
and 1
let 1
him 1
quit 1
the 1
thing 1
right 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
and 1
save 1
himself 1
And 1
I 1
did 1
start 1
to 1
tell 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
shut 1
me 1
up 1
and 1
says 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
reckon 1
I 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
m 1
about 1
Don 1
t 1
I 1
generly 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
m 1
about 1
Yes 1
Didn 1
t 1
I 1
say 1
I 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
help 1
steal 1
the 1
nigger 1
Yes 1
Well 1
then 1
That 1
s 1
all 1
he 1
said 1
and 1
that 1
s 1
all 1
I 1
said 1
It 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
say 1
any 1
more 1
because 1
when 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
d 1
do 1
a 1
thing 1
he 1
always 1
done 1
it 1
But 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
make 1
out 1
how 1
he 1
was 1
willing 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
this 1
thing 1
so 1
I 1
just 1
let 1
it 1
go 1
and 1
never 1
bothered 1
no 1
more 1
about 1
it 1
If 1
he 1
was 1
bound 1
to 1
have 1
it 1
so 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
help 1
it 1
When 1
we 1
got 1
home 1
the 1
house 1
was 1
all 1
dark 1
and 1
still 1
so 1
we 1
went 1
on 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
hut 1
by 1
the 1
ash 1
hopper 1
for 1
to 1
examine 1
it 1
We 1
went 1
through 1
the 1
yard 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
the 1
hounds 1
would 1
do 1
They 1
knowed 1
us 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
make 1
no 1
more 1
noise 1
than 1
country 1
dogs 1
is 1
always 1
doing 1
when 1
anything 1
comes 1
by 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
When 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
cabin 1
we 1
took 1
a 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
front 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
sides 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
side 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
acquainted 1
with 1
which 1
was 1
the 1
north 1
side 1
we 1
found 1
a 1
square 1
window 1
hole 1
up 1
tolerable 1
high 1
with 1
just 1
one 1
stout 1
board 1
nailed 1
across 1
it 1
I 1
says 1
Here 1
s 1
the 1
ticket 1
This 1
hole 1
s 1
big 1
enough 1
for 1
Jim 1
to 1
get 1
through 1
if 1
we 1
wrench 1
off 1
the 1
board 1
Tom 1
says 1
It 1
s 1
as 1
simple 1
as 1
tit 1
tat 1
toe 1
three 1
in 1
a 1
row 1
and 1
as 1
easy 1
as 1
playing 1
hooky 1
I 1
should 1
hope 1
we 1
can 1
find 1
a 1
way 1
that 1
s 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
complicated 1
than 1
that 1
Huck 1
Finn 1
Well 1
then 1
I 1
says 1
how 1
ll 1
it 1
do 1
to 1
saw 1
him 1
out 1
the 1
way 1
I 1
done 1
before 1
I 1
was 1
murdered 1
that 1
time 1
That 1
s 1
more 1
like 1
he 1
says 1
It 1
s 1
real 1
mysterious 1
and 1
troublesome 1
and 1
good 1
he 1
says 1
but 1
I 1
bet 1
we 1
can 1
find 1
a 1
way 1
that 1
s 1
twice 1
as 1
long 1
There 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
hurry 1
le 1
s 1
keep 1
on 1
looking 1
around 1
Betwixt 1
the 1
hut 1
and 1
the 1
fence 1
on 1
the 1
back 1
side 1
was 1
a 1
lean 1
to 1
that 1
joined 1
the 1
hut 1
at 1
the 1
eaves 1
and 1
was 1
made 1
out 1
of 1
plank 1
It 1
was 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
the 1
hut 1
but 1
narrow 1
only 1
about 1
six 1
foot 1
wide 1
The 1
door 1
to 1
it 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
south 1
end 1
and 1
was 1
padlocked 1
Tom 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
soap 1
kettle 1
and 1
searched 1
around 1
and 1
fetched 1
back 1
the 1
iron 1
thing 1
they 1
lift 1
the 1
lid 1
with 1
so 1
he 1
took 1
it 1
and 1
prized 1
out 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
staples 1
The 1
chain 1
fell 1
down 1
and 1
we 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
went 1
in 1
and 1
shut 1
it 1
and 1
struck 1
a 1
match 1
and 1
see 1
the 1
shed 1
was 1
only 1
built 1
against 1
a 1
cabin 1
and 1
hadn 1
t 1
no 1
connection 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
floor 1
to 1
the 1
shed 1
nor 1
nothing 1
in 1
it 1
but 1
some 1
old 1
rusty 1
played 1
out 1
hoes 1
and 1
spades 1
and 1
picks 1
and 1
a 1
crippled 1
plow 1
The 1
match 1
went 1
out 1
and 1
so 1
did 1
we 1
and 1
shoved 1
in 1
the 1
staple 1
again 1
and 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
locked 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
ever 1
Tom 1
was 1
joyful 1
He 1
says 1
Now 1
we 1
re 1
all 1
right 1
We 1
ll 1
dig 1
him 1
out 1
It 1
ll 1
take 1
about 1
a 1
week 1
Then 1
we 1
started 1
for 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
I 1
went 1
in 1
the 1
back 1
door 1
you 1
only 1
have 1
to 1
pull 1
a 1
buckskin 1
latch 1
string 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
fasten 1
the 1
doors 1
but 1
that 1
warn 1
t 1
romantical 1
enough 1
for 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
no 1
way 1
would 1
do 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
must 1
climb 1
up 1
the 1
lightning 1
rod 1
But 1
after 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
half 1
way 1
about 1
three 1
times 1
and 1
missed 1
fire 1
and 1
fell 1
every 1
time 1
and 1
the 1
last 1
time 1
most 1
busted 1
his 1
brains 1
out 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
d 1
got 1
to 1
give 1
it 1
up 1
but 1
after 1
he 1
was 1
rested 1
he 1
allowed 1
he 1
would 1
give 1
her 1
one 1
more 1
turn 1
for 1
luck 1
and 1
this 1
time 1
he 1
made 1
the 1
trip 1
In 1
the 1
morning 1
we 1
was 1
up 1
at 1
break 1
of 1
day 1
and 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
nigger 1
cabins 1
to 1
pet 1
the 1
dogs 1
and 1
make 1
friends 1
with 1
the 1
nigger 1
that 1
fed 1
Jim 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
Jim 1
that 1
was 1
being 1
fed 1
The 1
niggers 1
was 1
just 1
getting 1
through 1
breakfast 1
and 1
starting 1
for 1
the 1
fields 1
and 1
Jim 1
s 1
nigger 1
was 1
piling 1
up 1
a 1
tin 1
pan 1
with 1
bread 1
and 1
meat 1
and 1
things 1
and 1
whilst 1
the 1
others 1
was 1
leaving 1
the 1
key 1
come 1
from 1
the 1
house 1
This 1
nigger 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
natured 1
chuckle 1
headed 1
face 1
and 1
his 1
wool 1
was 1
all 1
tied 1
up 1
in 1
little 1
bunches 1
with 1
thread 1
That 1
was 1
to 1
keep 1
witches 1
off 1
He 1
said 1
the 1
witches 1
was 1
pestering 1
him 1
awful 1
these 1
nights 1
and 1
making 1
him 1
see 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
strange 1
things 1
and 1
hear 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
strange 1
words 1
and 1
noises 1
and 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
believe 1
he 1
was 1
ever 1
witched 1
so 1
long 1
before 1
in 1
his 1
life 1
He 1
got 1
so 1
worked 1
up 1
and 1
got 1
to 1
running 1
on 1
so 1
about 1
his 1
troubles 1
he 1
forgot 1
all 1
about 1
what 1
he 1
d 1
been 1
a 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
So 1
Tom 1
says 1
What 1
s 1
the 1
vittles 1
for 1
Going 1
to 1
feed 1
the 1
dogs 1
The 1
nigger 1
kind 1
of 1
smiled 1
around 1
gradually 1
over 1
his 1
face 1
like 1
when 1
you 1
heave 1
a 1
brickbat 1
in 1
a 1
mud 1
puddle 1
and 1
he 1
says 1
Yes 1
Mars 1
Sid 1
A 1
dog 1
Cur 1

dog 1
too 1
Does 1
you 1
want 1
to 1

Yes 1
I 1
hunched 1
Tom 1
and 1
whispers 1
You 1
going 1
right 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
daybreak 1
that 1
warn 1
t 1
the 1
plan 1
No 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
but 1
it 1
s 1
the 1
plan 1
now 1
So 1
drat 1
him 1
we 1
went 1
along 1
but 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
like 1
it 1
much 1
When 1
we 1
got 1
in 1
we 1
couldn 1
t 1
hardly 1
see 1
anything 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
dark 1
but 1
Jim 1
was 1
there 1
sure 1
enough 1
and 1
could 1
see 1
us 1
and 1
he 1
sings 1
out 1
Why 1

En 1

I 1
didn 1
t 1

and 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1

because 1

and 1
says 1
Why 1

sakes 1
do 1
he 1
know 1
you 1
genlmen 1
We 1
could 1
see 1
pretty 1
well 1
now 1
Tom 1
he 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
nigger 1
steady 1
and 1
kind 1
of 1
wondering 1
and 1
says 1
Does 1

Why 1
dis 1

runaway 1

I 1
don 1
t 1

but 1

What 1

Didn 1

Tom 1
says 1
in 1
a 1
puzzled 1
up 1
kind 1
of 1
way 1
Well 1

mighty 1
curious 1
Who 1

sing 1
out 1
And 1
turns 1
to 1
me 1
perfectly 1
ca 1
m 1
and 1
says 1
Did 1

Of 1
course 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
nothing 1
to 1

but 1

one 1
thing 1
so 1
I 1
says 1
No 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1

say 1

Then 1
he 1
turns 1
to 1
Jim 1
and 1
looks 1
him 1
over 1
like 1
he 1
never 1
see 1

says 1

So 1
Tom 1

to 1
the 1
nigger 1

looking 1
wild 1
and 1
distressed 1
and 1

to 1
buy 1
some 1
more 1
thread 1
to 1

up 1
his 1
wool 1
with 1
and 1
then 1
looks 1
at 1
Jim 1
and 1
says 1
I 1
wonder 1
if 1
Uncle 1
Silas 1
is 1
going 1
to 1
hang 1
this 1
nigger 1
If 1
I 1
was 1
to 1
catch 1
a 1
nigger 1
that 1
was 1
ungrateful 1
enough 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
give 1
him 1
up 1
I 1
d 1
hang 1
him 1
And 1
whilst 1
the 1
nigger 1
stepped 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
dime 1
and 1
bite 1
it 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
good 1
he 1
whispers 1
to 1
Jim 1
and 1
says 1
Don 1
t 1
ever 1
let 1
on 1
to 1
know 1
us 1
And 1
if 1
you 1
hear 1
any 1
digging 1
going 1
on 1
nights 1
it 1
s 1
us 1
we 1
re 1
going 1
to 1
set 1
you 1
free 1
Jim 1
only 1
had 1
time 1
to 1
grab 1
us 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
squeeze 1
it 1
then 1
the 1
nigger 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
we 1
said 1
we 1
d 1
come 1
again 1
some 1
time 1
if 1
the 1
nigger 1
wanted 1
us 1
to 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
more 1
particular 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
dark 1
because 1
the 1
witches 1
went 1
for 1
him 1
mostly 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
good 1
to 1
have 1
folks 1
around 1
then 1
CHAPTER 1
XXXV 1
IT 1
would 1
be 1
most 1
an 1
hour 1
yet 1
till 1
breakfast 1
so 1
we 1
left 1
and 1
struck 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
woods 1
because 1
Tom 1
said 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
have 1
some 1
light 1
to 1
see 1
how 1
to 1
dig 1
by 1
and 1
a 1
lantern 1
makes 1
too 1
much 1
and 1
might 1
get 1
us 1
into 1
trouble 1
what 1
we 1
must 1
have 1
was 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
them 1
rotten 1
chunks 1
that 1
s 1
called 1
fox 1
fire 1
and 1
just 1
makes 1
a 1
soft 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
glow 1
when 1
you 1
lay 1
them 1
in 1
a 1
dark 1
place 1
We 1
fetched 1
an 1
armful 1
and 1
hid 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
weeds 1
and 1
set 1
down 1
to 1
rest 1
and 1
Tom 1
says 1
kind 1
of 1
dissatisfied 1
Blame 1
it 1
this 1
whole 1
thing 1
is 1
just 1
as 1
easy 1
and 1
awkward 1
as 1
it 1
can 1
be 1
And 1
so 1
it 1
makes 1
it 1
so 1
rotten 1
difficult 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
a 1
difficult 1
plan 1
There 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
watchman 1
to 1
be 1
drugged 1
now 1
there 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
watchman 1
There 1
ain 1
t 1
even 1
a 1
dog 1
to 1
give 1
a 1
sleeping 1
mixture 1
to 1
And 1
there 1
s 1
Jim 1
chained 1
by 1
one 1
leg 1
with 1
a 1
ten 1
foot 1
chain 1
to 1
the 1
leg 1
of 1
his 1
bed 1
why 1
all 1
you 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
is 1
to 1
lift 1
up 1
the 1
bedstead 1
and 1
slip 1
off 1
the 1
chain 1
And 1
Uncle 1
Silas 1
he 1
trusts 1
everybody 1
sends 1
the 1
key 1
to 1
the 1
punkin 1
headed 1
nigger 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
send 1
nobody 1
to 1
watch 1
the 1
nigger 1
Jim 1
could 1
a 1
got 1
out 1
of 1
that 1
window 1
hole 1
before 1
this 1
only 1
there 1
wouldn 1
t 1
be 1
no 1
use 1
trying 1
to 1
travel 1
with 1
a 1
ten 1
foot 1
chain 1
on 1
his 1
leg 1
Why 1
drat 1
it 1
Huck 1
it 1
s 1
the 1
stupidest 1
arrangement 1
I 1
ever 1
see 1
You 1
got 1
to 1
invent 1
all 1
the 1
difficulties 1
Well 1
we 1
can 1
t 1
help 1
it 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
best 1
we 1
can 1
with 1
the 1
materials 1
we 1
ve 1
got 1
Anyhow 1
there 1
s 1
one 1
thing 1
there 1
s 1
more 1
honor 1
in 1
getting 1
him 1
out 1
through 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
difficulties 1
and 1
dangers 1
where 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
furnished 1
to 1
you 1
by 1
the 1
people 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
their 1
duty 1
to 1
furnish 1
them 1
and 1
you 1
had 1
to 1
contrive 1
them 1
all 1
out 1
of 1
your 1
own 1
head 1
Now 1
look 1
at 1
just 1
that 1
one 1
thing 1
of 1
the 1
lantern 1
When 1
you 1
come 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
cold 1
facts 1
we 1
simply 1
got 1
to 1
let 1
on 1
that 1
a 1
lantern 1
s 1
resky 1
Why 1
we 1
could 1
work 1
with 1
a 1
torchlight 1
procession 1
if 1
we 1
wanted 1
to 1
I 1
believe 1
Now 1
whilst 1
I 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
hunt 1
up 1
something 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
saw 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
chance 1
we 1
get 1
What 1
do 1
we 1
want 1
of 1
a 1
saw 1
What 1
do 1
we 1
want 1
of 1
it 1
Hain 1
t 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
saw 1
the 1
leg 1
of 1
Jim 1
s 1
bed 1
off 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
chain 1
loose 1
Why 1
you 1
just 1
said 1
a 1
body 1
could 1
lift 1
up 1
the 1
bedstead 1
and 1
slip 1
the 1
chain 1
off 1
Well 1
if 1
that 1
ain 1
t 1
just 1
like 1
you 1
Huck 1
Finn 1
You 1
can 1
get 1
up 1
the 1
infant 1
schooliest 1
ways 1
of 1
going 1
at 1
a 1
thing 1
Why 1
hain 1
t 1
you 1
ever 1
read 1
any 1
books 1
at 1
all 1
Baron 1
Trenck 1
nor 1
Casanova 1
nor 1
Benvenuto 1
Chelleeny 1
nor 1
Henri 1
IV 1
nor 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
heroes 1
Who 1
ever 1
heard 1
of 1
getting 1
a 1
prisoner 1
loose 1
in 1
such 1
an 1
old 1
maidy 1
way 1
as 1
that 1
No 1
the 1
way 1
all 1
the 1
best 1
authorities 1
does 1
is 1
to 1
saw 1
the 1
bed 1
leg 1
in 1
two 1
and 1
leave 1
it 1
just 1
so 1
and 1
swallow 1
the 1
sawdust 1
so 1
it 1
can 1
t 1
be 1
found 1
and 1
put 1
some 1
dirt 1
and 1
grease 1
around 1
the 1
sawed 1
place 1
so 1
the 1
very 1
keenest 1
seneskal 1
can 1
t 1
see 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
it 1
s 1
being 1
sawed 1
and 1
thinks 1
the 1
bed 1
leg 1
is 1
perfectly 1
sound 1
Then 1
the 1
night 1
you 1
re 1
ready 1
fetch 1
the 1
leg 1
a 1
kick 1
down 1
she 1
goes 1
slip 1
off 1
your 1
chain 1
and 1
there 1
you 1
are 1
Nothing 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
hitch 1
your 1
rope 1
ladder 1
to 1
the 1
battlements 1
shin 1
down 1
it 1
break 1
your 1
leg 1
in 1
the 1
moat 1
because 1
a 1
rope 1
ladder 1
is 1
nineteen 1
foot 1
too 1
short 1
you 1
know 1
and 1
there 1
s 1
your 1
horses 1
and 1
your 1
trusty 1
vassles 1
and 1
they 1
scoop 1
you 1
up 1
and 1
fling 1
you 1
across 1
a 1
saddle 1
and 1
away 1
you 1
go 1
to 1
your 1
native 1
Langudoc 1
or 1
Navarre 1
or 1
wherever 1
it 1
is 1
It 1
s 1
gaudy 1
Huck 1
I 1
wish 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
moat 1
to 1
this 1
cabin 1
If 1
we 1
get 1
time 1
the 1
night 1
of 1
the 1
escape 1
we 1
ll 1
dig 1
one 1
I 1
says 1
What 1
do 1
we 1
want 1
of 1
a 1
moat 1
when 1
we 1
re 1
going 1
to 1
snake 1
him 1
out 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
cabin 1
But 1
he 1
never 1
heard 1
me 1
He 1
had 1
forgot 1
me 1
and 1
everything 1
else 1
He 1
had 1
his 1
chin 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
thinking 1
Pretty 1
soon 1
he 1
sighs 1
and 1
shakes 1
his 1
head 1
then 1
sighs 1
again 1
and 1
says 1
No 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
do 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
necessity 1
enough 1
for 1
it 1
For 1
what 1
I 1
says 1
Why 1
to 1
saw 1
Jim 1
s 1
leg 1
off 1
he 1
says 1
Good 1
land 1
I 1
says 1
why 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
necessity 1
for 1
it 1
And 1
what 1
would 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
saw 1
his 1
leg 1
off 1
for 1
anyway 1
Well 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
best 1
authorities 1
has 1
done 1
it 1
They 1
couldn 1
t 1
get 1
the 1
chain 1
off 1
so 1
they 1
just 1
cut 1
their 1
hand 1
off 1
and 1
shoved 1
And 1
a 1
leg 1
would 1
be 1
better 1
still 1
But 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
let 1
that 1
go 1
There 1
ain 1
t 1
necessity 1
enough 1
in 1
this 1
case 1
and 1
besides 1
Jim 1
s 1
a 1
nigger 1
and 1
wouldn 1
t 1
understand 1
the 1
reasons 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
how 1
it 1
s 1
the 1
custom 1
in 1
Europe 1
so 1
we 1
ll 1
let 1
it 1
go 1
But 1
there 1
s 1
one 1
thing 1
he 1
can 1
have 1
a 1
rope 1
ladder 1
we 1
can 1
tear 1
up 1
our 1
sheets 1
and 1
make 1
him 1
a 1
rope 1
ladder 1
easy 1
enough 1
And 1
we 1
can 1
send 1
it 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
pie 1
it 1
s 1
mostly 1
done 1
that 1
way 1
And 1
I 1
ve 1
et 1

Of 1

That 1

a 1
pretty 1
howdy 1
do 1
wouldn 1

I 1
never 1

of 1
such 1
a 1
thing 1
Well 1
I 1
says 1
if 1
it 1
s 1
in 1
the 1
regulations 1
and 1
he 1
s 1
got 1
to 1
have 1
it 1
all 1

because 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
wish 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
on 1
no 1
regulations 1
but 1
there 1
s 1
one 1
thing 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
if 1
we 1
go 1
to 1
tearing 1
up 1
our 1
sheets 1
to 1
make 1
Jim 1
a 1
rope 1
ladder 1
we 1
re 1

to 1
get 1
into 1
trouble 1
with 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
just 1
as 1

Now 1

way 1
I 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
a 1
hickry 1
bark 1
ladder 1
don 1
t 1
cost 1
nothing 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
waste 1
nothing 1
and 1
is 1
just 1
as 1
good 1
to 1
load 1
up 1
a 1
pie 1
with 1
and 1
hide 1
in 1
a 1
straw 1
tick 1
as 1

start 1
and 1
as 1
for 1
Jim 1
he 1

care 1
what 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
Oh 1
shucks 1
Huck 1
Finn 1
if 1
I 1
was 1
as 1
ignorant 1
as 1
you 1
I 1

D 1

Who 1
ever 1
heard 1
of 1
a 1
state 1
prisoner 1
escaping 1
by 1
a 1

Why 1

perfectly 1
ridiculous 1
Well 1
all 1
right 1
Tom 1

it 1
your 1
own 1
way 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
ll 1
take 1
my 1
advice 1
you 1
ll 1
let 1
me 1
borrow 1
a 1
sheet 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
clothesline 1
He 1
said 1
that 1
would 1
do 1
And 1
that 1
gave 1
him 1
another 1
idea 1
and 1
he 1
says 1
Borrow 1
a 1
shirt 1
too 1
What 1
do 1
we 1
want 1
of 1
a 1
shirt 1
Tom 1
Want 1
it 1
for 1
Jim 1
to 1

an 1
old 1
pewter 1
spoon 1
or 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
iron 1
barrel 1
hoop 1
Why 1
Tom 1
we 1

a 1
feather 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
goose 1
and 1
make 1
him 1
a 1
better 1
one 1
and 1
quicker 1
too 1
Prisoners 1

hardest 1
toughest 1
troublesomest 1
piece 1
of 1

brass 1
candlestick 1
or 1
something 1
like 1
that 1
they 1
can 1
get 1
their 1
hands 1
on 1
and 1
it 1
takes 1
them 1
weeks 1
and 1
weeks 1
and 1
months 1
and 1
months 1
to 1
file 1
it 1
out 1
too 1
because 1
they 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
by 1
rubbing 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
wall 1
They 1
wouldn 1
t 1
use 1
a 1
goose 1
quill 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
it 1
It 1
ain 1
t 1

Well 1
then 1

Many 1
makes 1

s 1
the 1
common 1
sort 1
and 1
women 1
the 1
best 1
authorities 1
uses 1
their 1
own 1
blood 1
Jim 1
can 1
do 1
that 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
wants 1
to 1
send 1
any 1
little 1
common 1
ordinary 1
mysterious 1
message 1
to 1
let 1
the 1
world 1
know 1
where 1
he 1
s 1
captivated 1
he 1
can 1
write 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
a 1
tin 1
plate 1
with 1
a 1
fork 1
and 1
throw 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
The 1
Iron 1
Mask 1
always 1

that 1
and 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
blame 1
good 1
way 1
too 1
Jim 1
ain 1
t 1
got 1
no 1
tin 1
plates 1
They 1
feed 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
pan 1
That 1
ain 1
t 1
nothing 1
we 1
can 1
get 1

some 1
Can 1
t 1
nobody 1
read 1
his 1
plates 1
That 1
ain 1
t 1
got 1
anything 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
Huck 1
Finn 1
All 1
he 1
s 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
is 1
to 1
write 1
on 1
the 1
plate 1
and 1
throw 1
it 1
out 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
read 1
it 1
Why 1
half 1
the 1
time 1
you 1
can 1
t 1
read 1
anything 1
a 1
prisoner 1
writes 1
on 1
a 1
tin 1
plate 1
or 1
anywhere 1
else 1
Well 1
then 1
what 1
s 1
the 1
sense 1
in 1
wasting 1
the 1
plates 1
Why 1
blame 1
it 1
all 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
the 1
prisoner 1
s 1
plates 1
But 1
it 1
s 1
somebody 1
s 1
plates 1
ain 1
t 1
it 1
Well 1
spos 1
n 1
it 1
is 1
What 1
does 1
the 1
prisoner 1
care 1
whose 1
He 1
broke 1
off 1
there 1
because 1
we 1
heard 1
the 1
breakfast 1
horn 1
blowing 1
So 1
we 1
cleared 1
out 1
for 1
the 1
house 1
Along 1
during 1
the 1
morning 1
I 1
borrowed 1
a 1
sheet 1
and 1
a 1
white 1
shirt 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
clothes 1
line 1
and 1
I 1
found 1
an 1
old 1
sack 1
and 1
put 1
them 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
we 1
went 1
down 1
and 1
got 1
the 1
fox 1
fire 1
and 1
put 1
that 1
in 1
too 1
I 1
called 1
it 1
borrowing 1
because 1
that 1
was 1
what 1
pap 1
always 1
called 1
it 1
but 1
Tom 1
said 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
borrowing 1
it 1
was 1
stealing 1
He 1
said 1
we 1
was 1
representing 1
prisoners 1
and 1
prisoners 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
how 1
they 1
get 1
a 1
thing 1
so 1
they 1
get 1
it 1
and 1
nobody 1
don 1
t 1
blame 1
them 1
for 1
it 1
either 1
It 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
crime 1
in 1
a 1
prisoner 1
to 1
steal 1
the 1
thing 1
he 1
needs 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
with 1
Tom 1
said 1
it 1
s 1
his 1
right 1
and 1
so 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
we 1
was 1
representing 1
a 1
prisoner 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
perfect 1
right 1
to 1
steal 1
anything 1
on 1
this 1
place 1
we 1
had 1
the 1
least 1
use 1
for 1
to 1
get 1
ourselves 1
out 1
of 1
prison 1
with 1
He 1
said 1
if 1
we 1
warn 1
t 1
prisoners 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
very 1
different 1
thing 1
and 1
nobody 1
but 1
a 1
mean 1
ornery 1
person 1
would 1
steal 1
when 1
he 1
warn 1
t 1
a 1
prisoner 1
So 1
we 1
allowed 1
we 1
would 1
steal 1
everything 1
there 1
was 1
that 1
come 1
handy 1
And 1
yet 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
mighty 1
fuss 1
one 1
day 1
after 1
that 1
when 1
I 1
stole 1
a 1
watermelon 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
nigger 1
patch 1
and 1
eat 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
made 1
me 1
go 1
and 1
give 1
the 1
niggers 1
a 1
dime 1
without 1
telling 1
them 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
for 1
Tom 1
said 1
that 1
what 1
he 1
meant 1
was 1
we 1
could 1
steal 1
anything 1
we 1
needed 1
Well 1
I 1
says 1
I 1
needed 1
the 1
watermelon 1
But 1
he 1
said 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
need 1
it 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
prison 1
with 1
there 1
s 1
where 1
the 1
difference 1
was 1
He 1
said 1
if 1
I 1
d 1
a 1
wanted 1
it 1
to 1
hide 1
a 1
knife 1
in 1
and 1
smuggle 1
it 1
to 1
Jim 1
to 1
kill 1
the 1
seneskal 1
with 1
it 1
would 1
a 1
been 1
all 1
right 1
So 1
I 1
let 1
it 1
go 1
at 1
that 1
though 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
no 1
advantage 1
in 1
my 1
representing 1
a 1
prisoner 1
if 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
set 1
down 1
and 1
chaw 1
over 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
gold 1
leaf 1
distinctions 1
like 1
that 1
every 1
time 1
I 1
see 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
hog 1
a 1
watermelon 1
Well 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
saying 1
we 1
waited 1
that 1
morning 1
till 1
everybody 1
was 1
settled 1
down 1
to 1
business 1
and 1
nobody 1
in 1
sight 1
around 1
the 1
yard 1
then 1
Tom 1
he 1
carried 1
the 1
sack 1
into 1
the 1
lean 1
to 1
whilst 1
I 1
stood 1
off 1
a 1
piece 1
to 1
keep 1
watch 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
he 1
come 1
out 1
and 1
we 1
went 1
and 1
set 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
woodpile 1
to 1
talk 1
He 1
says 1
Everything 1
s 1
all 1
right 1
now 1
except 1
tools 1
and 1
that 1
s 1
easy 1
fixed 1
Tools 1
I 1
says 1
Yes 1
Tools 1
for 1
what 1
Why 1
to 1
dig 1
with 1
We 1
ain 1
t 1
a 1
going 1
to 1
gnaw 1
him 1
out 1
are 1
we 1
Ain 1
t 1
them 1
old 1
crippled 1
picks 1
and 1
things 1
in 1
there 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
dig 1
a 1
nigger 1
out 1
with 1
I 1
says 1
He 1
turns 1
on 1
me 1
looking 1
pitying 1
enough 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
body 1
cry 1
and 1
says 1
Huck 1
Finn 1
did 1
you 1
ever 1
hear 1
of 1
a 1
prisoner 1
having 1
picks 1
and 1
shovels 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
modern 1
conveniences 1
in 1
his 1
wardrobe 1
to 1
dig 1
himself 1
out 1
with 1
Now 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
got 1
any 1
reasonableness 1
in 1
you 1
at 1
all 1
what 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
show 1
would 1
that 1
give 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
hero 1
Why 1
they 1
might 1
as 1
well 1
lend 1
him 1
the 1
key 1
and 1
done 1
with 1
it 1
Picks 1
and 1
shovels 1
why 1
they 1
wouldn 1
t 1
furnish 1
em 1
to 1
a 1
king 1
Well 1
then 1
I 1
says 1
if 1
we 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
the 1
picks 1
and 1
shovels 1
what 1
do 1
we 1
want 1
A 1
couple 1
of 1
case 1
knives 1
To 1
dig 1
the 1
foundations 1
out 1
from 1
under 1
that 1
cabin 1
with 1
Yes 1
Confound 1
it 2
s 1
foolish 1
Tom 1
It 1
don 1
t 1
make 1
no 1
difference 1
how 1
foolish 1
it 1
is 1
it 1
s 1
the 1
right 1
way 1
and 1
it 1
s 1
the 1
regular 1
way 1
And 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
other 1
way 1
that 1
ever 1
I 1
heard 1
of 1
and 1
I 1
ve 1
read 1
all 1
the 1
books 1
that 1
gives 1
any 1
information 1
about 1
these 1
things 1
They 1
always 1
dig 1
out 1
with 1
a 1
case 1
knife 1
and 1
not 1
through 1
dirt 1
mind 1
you 1
generly 1
it 1
s 1
through 1
solid 1
rock 1
And 1
it 1
takes 1
them 1
weeks 1
and 1
weeks 1
and 1
weeks 1
and 1
for 1
ever 1
and 1
ever 1
Why 1
look 1
at 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
prisoners 1
in 1
the 1
bottom 1
dungeon 1
of 1
the 1
Castle 1
Deef 1
in 1
the 1
harbor 1
of 1
Marseilles 1
that 1
dug 1
himself 1
out 1
that 1
way 1
how 1
long 1
was 1
he 1
at 1
it 1
you 1
reckon 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
Well 1
guess 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
A 1
month 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
Thirty 1
seven 1
year 1
and 1
he 1
come 1
out 1
in 1
China 1
That 1
s 1
the 1
kind 1
I 1
wish 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
this 1
fortress 1
was 1
solid 1
rock 1
Jim 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
nobody 1
in 1
China 1
What 1
s 1
that 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
Neither 1
did 1
that 1
other 1
fellow 1
But 1
you 1
re 1
always 1
a 1
wandering 1
off 1
on 1
a 1
side 1
issue 1
Why 1
can 1
t 1
you 1
stick 1
to 1
the 1
main 1
point 1
All 1
right 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
where 1
he 1
comes 1
out 1
so 1
he 1
comes 1
out 1
and 1
Jim 1
don 1
t 1
either 1
I 1
reckon 1
But 1
there 1
s 1
one 1
thing 1
anyway 1
Jim 1
s 1
too 1
old 1
to 1
be 1
dug 1
out 1
with 1
a 1
case 1
knife 1
He 1
won 1
t 1
last 1
Yes 1
he 1
will 1
last 1
too 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
reckon 1
it 1
s 1
going 1
to 1
take 1
thirty 1
seven 1
years 1
to 1
dig 1
out 1
through 1
a 1
dirt 1
foundation 1
do 1
you 1
How 1
long 1
will 1
it 1
take 1
Tom 1
Well 1
we 1
can 1
t 1
resk 1
being 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
we 1
ought 1
to 1
because 1
it 1
mayn 1
t 1
take 1
very 1
long 1
for 1
Uncle 1
Silas 1
to 1
hear 1
from 1
down 1
there 1
by 1
New 1
Orleans 1
He 1
ll 1
hear 1
Jim 1
ain 1
t 1
from 1
there 1
Then 1
his 1
next 1
move 1
will 1
be 1
to 1
advertise 1
Jim 1
or 1
something 1
like 1
that 1
So 1
we 1
can 1
t 1
resk 1
being 1
as 1
long 1
digging 1
him 1
out 1
as 1
we 1
ought 1
to 1
By 1
rights 1
I 1
reckon 1
we 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
years 1
but 1
we 1
can 1
t 1
Things 1
being 1
so 1
uncertain 1
what 1
I 1
recommend 1
is 1
this 1
that 1
we 1
really 1
dig 1
right 1
in 1
as 1
quick 1
as 1
we 1
can 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
we 1
can 1
let 1
on 1
to 1
ourselves 1
that 1
we 1
was 1
at 1
it 1
thirty 1
seven 1
years 1
Then 1
we 1
can 1
snatch 1
him 1
out 1
and 1
rush 1
him 1
away 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
there 1
s 1
an 1
alarm 1
Yes 1
I 1
reckon 1
that 1
ll 1
be 1
the 1
best 1
way 1
Now 1
there 1
s 1
sense 1
in 1
that 1
I 1
says 1
Letting 1
on 1
don 1
t 1
cost 1
nothing 1
letting 1
on 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
trouble 1
and 1
if 1
it 1
s 1
any 1
object 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
mind 1
letting 1
on 1
we 1
was 1
at 1
it 1
a 1
hundred 1
and 1
fifty 1
year 1
It 1
wouldn 1
t 1
strain 1
me 1
none 1
after 1
I 1
got 1
my 1
hand 1
in 1
So 1
I 1
ll 1
mosey 1
along 1
now 1
and 1
smouch 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
case 1
knives 1
Smouch 1
three 1
he 1
says 1
we 1
want 1
one 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
saw 1
out 1
of 1
Tom 1
if 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
unregular 1
and 1
irreligious 1
to 1
sejest 1
it 1
I 1
says 1
there 1
s 1
an 1
old 1
rusty 1
saw 1
blade 1
around 1
yonder 1
sticking 1
under 1
the 1
weather 1
boarding 1
behind 1
the 1
smoke 1
house 1
He 1
looked 1
kind 1
of 1
weary 1
and 1
discouraged 1
like 1
and 1
says 1
It 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
try 1
to 1
learn 1
you 1
nothing 1
Huck 1
Run 1
along 1
and 1
smouch 1
the 1
knives 1
three 1
of 1
them 1
So 1
I 1
done 1
it 1
CHAPTER 1
XXXVI 1
AS 1
soon 1
as 1
we 1
reckoned 1
everybody 1
was 1
asleep 1
that 1
night 1
we 1
went 1
down 1
the 1
lightning 1
rod 1
and 1
shut 1
ourselves 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
lean 1
to 1
and 1
got 1
out 1
our 1
pile 1
of 1
fox 1
fire 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
work 1
We 1
cleared 1
everything 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
about 1
four 1
or 1
five 1
foot 1
along 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
bottom 1
log 1
Tom 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
right 1
behind 1
Jim 1
s 1
bed 1
now 1
and 1
we 1
d 1
dig 1
in 1
under 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
we 1
got 1
through 1
there 1
couldn 1
t 1
nobody 1
in 1
the 1
cabin 1
ever 1
know 1
there 1
was 1
any 1
hole 1
there 1
because 1
Jim 1
s 1
counter 1
pin 1
hung 1
down 1
most 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
you 1
d 1
have 1
to 1
raise 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
look 1
under 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
hole 1
So 1
we 1
dug 1
and 1
dug 1
with 1
the 1
case 1
knives 1
till 1
most 1
midnight 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
was 1
dog 1
tired 1
and 1
our 1
hands 1
was 1
blistered 1
and 1
yet 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
we 1
d 1
done 1
anything 1
hardly 1
At 1
last 1
I 1
says 1
This 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
thirty 1
seven 1
year 1
job 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
thirty 1
eight 1
year 1
job 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
He 1
never 1
said 1
nothing 1
But 1
he 1
sighed 1
and 1
pretty 1
soon 1
he 1
stopped 1
digging 1
and 1
then 1
for 1
a 1
good 1
little 1
while 1
I 1
knowed 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
thinking 1
Then 1
he 1
says 1
It 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
use 1
Huck 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
a 1
going 1
to 1
work 1
If 1
we 1
was 1
prisoners 1
it 1
would 1
because 1
then 1
we 1
d 1
have 1
as 1
many 1
years 1
as 1
we 1
wanted 1
and 1
no 1
hurry 1
and 1
we 1
wouldn 1
t 1
get 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
to 1
dig 1
every 1
day 1
while 1
they 1
was 1
changing 1
watches 1
and 1
so 1
our 1
hands 1
wouldn 1
t 1
get 1
blistered 1
and 1
we 1
could 1
keep 1
it 1
up 1
right 1
along 1
year 1
in 1
and 1
year 1
out 1
and 1
do 1
it 1
right 1
and 1
the 1
way 1
it 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
But 1
we 1
can 1
t 1
fool 1
along 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
rush 1
we 1
ain 1
t 1
got 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
spare 1
If 1
we 1
was 1
to 1
put 1
in 1
another 1
night 1
this 1
way 1
we 1
d 1
have 1
to 1
knock 1
off 1
for 1
a 1
week 1
to 1
let 1
our 1
hands 1
get 1
well 1
couldn 1
t 1
touch 1
a 1
case 1
knife 1
with 1
them 1
sooner 1
Well 1
then 1
what 1
we 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
Tom 1
I 1
ll 1
tell 1
you 1
It 1
ain 1
t 1
right 1
and 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
moral 1
and 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
like 1
it 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
but 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
only 1
just 1
the 1
one 1
way 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
dig 1
him 1
out 1
with 1
the 1
picks 1
and 1
let 1
on 1
it 1
s 1
case 1
knives 1
Now 1
you 1
re 1
talking 1
I 1
says 1
your 1
head 1
gets 1
leveler 1
and 1
leveler 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
I 1
says 1
Picks 1
is 1
the 1
thing 1
moral 1
or 1
no 1
moral 1
and 1
as 1
for 1
me 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
shucks 1
for 1
the 1
morality 1
of 1
it 1
nohow 1
When 1
I 1
start 1
in 1
to 1
steal 1
a 1
nigger 1
or 1
a 1
watermelon 1
or 1
a 1
Sunday 1
school 1
book 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
ways 1
particular 1
how 1
it 1
s 1
done 1
so 1
it 1
s 1
done 1
What 1
I 1
want 1
is 1
my 1
nigger 1
or 1
what 1
I 1
want 1
is 1
my 1
watermelon 1
or 1
what 1
I 1
want 1
is 1
my 1
Sunday 1
school 1
book 1
and 1
if 1
a 1
pick 1
s 1
the 1
handiest 1
thing 1
that 1
s 1
the 1
thing 1
I 1
m 1
a 1
going 1
to 1
dig 1
that 1
nigger 1
or 1
that 1
watermelon 1
or 1
that 1
Sunday 1
school 1
book 1
out 1
with 1
and 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
give 1
a 1
dead 1
rat 1
what 1
the 1
authorities 1
thinks 1
about 1
it 1
nuther 1
Well 1
he 1
says 1
there 1
s 1
excuse 1
for 1
picks 1
and 1
letting 1
on 1
in 1
a 1
case 1
like 1
this 1
if 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
so 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
approve 1
of 1
it 1
nor 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
stand 1
by 1
and 1
see 1
the 1
rules 1
broke 1
because 1
right 1
is 1
right 1
and 1
wrong 1
is 1
wrong 1
and 1
a 1
body 1
ain 1
t 1
got 1
no 1
business 1
doing 1
wrong 1
when 1
he 1
ain 1
t 1
ignorant 1
and 1
knows 1
better 1
It 1
might 1
answer 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
dig 1
Jim 1
out 1
with 1
a 1
pick 1
without 1
any 1
letting 1
on 1
because 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
no 1
better 1
but 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
for 1
me 1
because 1
I 1
do 1
know 1
better 1
Gimme 1
a 1
case 1
knife 1
He 1
had 1
his 1
own 1
by 1
him 1
but 1
I 1
handed 1
him 1
mine 1
He 1
flung 1
it 1
down 1
and 1
says 1
Gimme 1
a 1
case 1
knife 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
just 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
then 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
scratched 1
around 1
amongst 1
the 1
old 1
tools 1
and 1
got 1
a 1
pickaxe 1
and 1
give 1
it 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
took 1
it 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
work 1
and 1
never 1
said 1
a 1
word 1
He 1
was 1
always 1
just 1
that 1
particular 1
Full 1
of 1
principle 1
So 1
then 1
I 1
got 1
a 1
shovel 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
picked 1
and 1
shoveled 1
turn 1
about 1
and 1
made 1
the 1
fur 1
fly 1
We 1
stuck 1
to 1
it 1
about 1
a 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
which 1
was 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
we 1
could 1
stand 1
up 1
but 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
of 1
a 1
hole 1
to 1
show 1
for 1
it 1
When 1
I 1
got 1
up 1
stairs 1
I 1
looked 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
see 1
Tom 1
doing 1
his 1
level 1
best 1
with 1
the 1
lightning 1
rod 1
but 1
he 1
couldn 1
t 1
come 1
it 1
his 1
hands 1
was 1
so 1
sore 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
says 1
It 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
use 1
it 1
can 1
t 1
be 1
done 1
What 1
you 1
reckon 1
I 1
better 1
do 1
Can 1
t 1
you 1
think 1
of 1
no 1
way 1
Yes 1
I 1
says 1
but 1
I 1
reckon 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
regular 1
Come 1
up 1
the 1
stairs 1
and 1
let 1
on 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
lightning 1
rod 1
So 1
he 1
done 1
it 1
Next 1
day 1
Tom 1
stole 1
a 1
pewter 1
spoon 1
and 1
a 1
brass 1
candlestick 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
for 1
to 1
make 1
some 1
pens 1
for 1
Jim 1
out 1
of 1
and 1
six 1
tallow 1
candles 1
and 1
I 1
hung 1
around 1
the 1
nigger 1
cabins 1
and 1
laid 1
for 1
a 1
chance 1
and 1
stole 1
three 1
tin 1
plates 1
Tom 1
says 1
it 1
wasn 1
t 1
enough 1
but 1
I 1
said 1
nobody 1
wouldn 1
t 1
ever 1
see 1
the 1
plates 1
that 1
Jim 1
throwed 1
out 1
because 1
they 1
d 1
fall 1
in 1
the 1
dog 1
fennel 1
and 1
jimpson 1
weeds 1
under 1
the 1
window 1
hole 1
then 1
we 1
could 1
tote 1
them 1
back 1
and 1
he 1
could 1
use 1
them 1
over 1
again 1
So 1
Tom 1
was 1
satisfied 1
Then 1
he 1
says 1
Now 1
the 1
thing 1
to 1
study 1
out 1
is 1
how 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
things 1
to 1
Jim 1
Take 1
them 1
in 1
through 1
the 1
hole 1
I 1
says 1
when 1
we 1
get 1
it 1
done 1
He 1
only 1
just 1
looked 1
scornful 1
and 1
said 1
something 1
about 1
nobody 1
ever 1
heard 1
of 1
such 1
an 1
idiotic 1
idea 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
studying 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
had 1
ciphered 1
out 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
ways 1
but 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
need 1
to 1
decide 1
on 1
any 1
of 1
them 1
yet 1
Said 1
we 1
d 1
got 1
to 1
post 1
Jim 1
first 1
That 1
night 1
we 1
went 1
down 1
the 1
lightning 1
rod 1
a 1
little 1
after 1
ten 1
and 1
took 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
candles 1
along 1
and 1
listened 1
under 1
the 1
window 1
hole 1
and 1
heard 1
Jim 1
snoring 1
so 1
we 1
pitched 1
it 1
in 1
and 1
it 1
didn 1
t 1
wake 1
him 1
Then 1
we 1
whirled 1
in 1
with 1
the 1
pick 1
and 1
shovel 1
and 1
in 1
about 1
two 1
hours 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
the 1
job 1
was 1
done 1
We 1
crept 1
in 1
under 1
Jim 1
s 1
bed 1
and 1
into 1
the 1
cabin 1
and 1
pawed 1
around 1
and 1
found 1
the 1
candle 1
and 1
lit 1
it 1
and 1
stood 1
over 1
Jim 1
awhile 1
and 1
found 1
him 1
looking 1
hearty 1
and 1
healthy 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
woke 1
him 1
up 1
gentle 1
and 1
gradual 1
He 1
was 1
so 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
us 1
he 1
most 1
cried 1
and 1
called 1
us 1
honey 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
pet 1
names 1
he 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
and 1
was 1
for 1
having 1
us 1
hunt 1
up 1
a 1
cold 1
chisel 1
to 1
cut 1
the 1
chain 1
off 1
of 1
his 1
leg 1
with 1
right 1
away 1
and 1
clearing 1
out 1
without 1
losing 1
any 1
time 1
But 1
Tom 1
he 1
showed 1
him 1
how 1
unregular 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
and 1
set 1
down 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
all 1
about 1
our 1
plans 1
and 1
how 1
we 1
could 1
alter 1
them 1
in 1
a 1
minute 1
any 1
time 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
alarm 1
and 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
least 1
afraid 1
because 1
we 1
would 1
see 1
he 1
got 1
away 1
sure 1
So 1
Jim 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
we 1
set 1
there 1
and 1
talked 1
over 1
old 1
times 1
awhile 1
and 1
then 1
Tom 1
asked 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
questions 1
and 1
when 1
Jim 1
told 1
him 1
Uncle 1
Silas 1
come 1
in 1
every 1
day 1
or 1
two 1
to 1
pray 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
come 1
in 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
comfortable 1
and 1
had 1
plenty 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
both 1
of 1
them 1
was 1
kind 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
be 1
Tom 1
says 1
Now 1
I 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
fix 1
it 1
We 1
ll 1
send 1
you 1
some 1
things 1
by 1
them 1
I 1
said 1
Don 1
t 1
do 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
it 1
s 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
jackass 1
ideas 1
I 1
ever 1
struck 1
but 1
he 1
never 1
paid 1
no 1
attention 1
to 1
me 1
went 1
right 1
on 1
It 1
was 1
his 1
way 1
when 1
he 1
d 1
got 1
his 1
plans 1
set 1
So 1
he 1
told 1
Jim 1
how 1
we 1
d 1
have 1
to 1
smuggle 1
in 1
the 1
rope 1
ladder 1
pie 1
and 1
other 1
large 1
things 1
by 1
Nat 1
the 1
nigger 1
that 1
fed 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
on 1
the 1
lookout 1
and 1
not 1
be 1
surprised 1
and 1
not 1
let 1
Nat 1
see 1
him 1
open 1
them 1
and 1
we 1
would 1
put 1
small 1
things 1
in 1
uncle 1
s 1
coat 1
pockets 1
and 1
he 1
must 1
steal 1
them 1
out 1
and 1
we 1
would 1
tie 1
things 1
to 1
aunt 1
s 1
apron 1
strings 1
or 1
put 1
them 1
in 1
her 1
apron 1
pocket 1
if 1
we 1
got 1
a 1
chance 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
what 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
and 1
what 1
they 1
was 1
for 1
And 1
told 1
him 1
how 1
to 1
keep 1
a 1
journal 1
on 1
the 1
shirt 1
with 1
his 1
blood 1
and 1
all 1
that 1
He 1
told 1
him 1
everything 1
Jim 1
he 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
no 1
sense 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
he 1
allowed 1
we 1
was 1
white 1
folks 1
and 1
knowed 1
better 1
than 1
him 1
so 1
he 1
was 1
satisfied 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
do 1
it 1
all 1
just 1
as 1
Tom 1
said 1
Jim 1
had 1
plenty 1
corn 1
cob 1
pipes 1
and 1
tobacco 1
so 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
right 1
down 1
good 1
sociable 1
time 1
then 1
we 1
crawled 1
out 1
through 1
the 1
hole 1
and 1
so 1
home 1
to 1
bed 1
with 1
hands 1
that 1
looked 1
like 1
they 1
d 1
been 1
chawed 1
Tom 1
was 1
in 1
high 1
spirits 1
He 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
best 1
fun 1
he 1
ever 1
had 1
in 1
his 1
life 1
and 1
the 1
most 1
intellectural 1
and 1
said 1
if 1
he 1
only 1
could 1
see 1
his 1
way 1
to 1
it 1
we 1
would 1
keep 1
it 1
up 1
all 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
our 1
lives 1
and 1
leave 1
Jim 1
to 1
our 1
children 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
for 1
he 1
believed 1
Jim 1
would 1
come 1
to 1
like 1
it 1
better 1
and 1
better 1
the 1
more 1
he 1
got 1
used 1
to 1
it 1
He 1
said 1
that 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
it 1
could 1
be 1
strung 1
out 1
to 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
eighty 1
year 1
and 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
best 1
time 1
on 1
record 1
And 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
would 1
make 1
us 1
all 1
celebrated 1
that 1
had 1
a 1
hand 1
in 1
it 1
In 1
the 1
morning 1
we 1
went 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
woodpile 1
and 1
chopped 1
up 1
the 1
brass 1
candlestick 1
into 1
handy 1
sizes 1
and 1
Tom 1
put 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
pewter 1
spoon 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
Then 1
we 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
nigger 1
cabins 1
and 1
while 1
I 1
got 1
Nat 1
s 1
notice 1
off 1
Tom 1
shoved 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
candlestick 1
into 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
a 1
corn 1
pone 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
Jim 1
s 1
pan 1
and 1
we 1
went 1
along 1
with 1
Nat 1
to 1
see 1
how 1
it 1
would 1
work 1
and 1
it 1
just 1
worked 1
noble 1
when 1
Jim 1
bit 1
into 1
it 2
most 1
mashed 1
all 1
his 1
teeth 1
out 1
and 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
ever 1
anything 1
could 1
a 1
worked 1
better 1
Tom 1
said 1
so 1
himself 1
Jim 1
he 1
never 1
let 1
on 1
but 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
just 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
rock 1
or 1
something 1
like 1
that 2
s 1
always 1
getting 1
into 1
bread 1
you 1
know 1
but 1
after 1
that 1
he 1
never 1
bit 1
into 1
nothing 1
but 1
what 1
he 1
jabbed 1
his 1
fork 1
into 1
it 1
in 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
places 1
first 1
And 1
whilst 1
we 1
was 1
a 1
standing 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
dimmish 1
light 1
here 1
comes 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
the 1
hounds 1
bulging 1
in 1
from 1
under 1
Jim 1
s 1
bed 1
and 1
they 1
kept 1
on 1
piling 1
in 1
till 1
there 1
was 1
eleven 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
hardly 1
room 1
in 1
there 1
to 1
get 1
your 1
breath 1
By 1
jings 1
we 1
forgot 1
to 1
fasten 1
that 1
lean 1
to 1
door 1
The 1
nigger 1
Nat 1
he 1
only 1
just 1
hollered 1
Witches 1
once 1
and 1
keeled 1
over 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
floor 1
amongst 1
the 1
dogs 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
groan 1
like 1
he 1
was 1
dying 1
Tom 1
jerked 1
the 1
door 1
open 1
and 1
flung 1
out 1
a 1
slab 1
of 1
Jim 1
s 1
meat 1
and 1
the 1
dogs 1
went 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
in 1
two 1
seconds 1
he 1
was 1
out 1
himself 1
and 1
back 1
again 1
and 1
shut 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
I 1
knowed 1
he 1
d 1
fixed 1
the 1
other 1
door 1
too 1
Then 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
work 1
on 1
the 1
nigger 1
coaxing 1
him 1
and 1
petting 1
him 1
and 1
asking 1
him 1
if 1
he 1
d 1
been 1
imagining 1
he 1
saw 1
something 1
again 1
He 1
raised 1
up 1
and 1
blinked 1
his 1
eyes 1
around 1
and 1
says 1
Mars 1

CHAPTER 1
XXXVII 1
THAT 1
was 1
all 1
fixed 1
So 1
then 1
we 1
went 1
away 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
rubbage 1
pile 1
in 1
the 1
back 1
yard 1
where 1
they 1
keep 1
the 1
old 1
boots 1
and 1
rags 1
and 1
pieces 1
of 1
bottles 1
and 1
wore 1
out 1
tin 1
things 1
and 1
all 1
such 1
truck 1
and 1
scratched 1
around 1
and 1
found 1
an 1
old 1
tin 1
washpan 1
and 1
stopped 1
up 1
the 1
holes 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
we 1
could 1
to 1
bake 1
the 1
pie 1
in 1
and 1
took 1
it 1
down 1
cellar 1
and 1
stole 1
it 1
full 1
of 1
flour 1
and 1
started 1
for 1
breakfast 1
and 1
found 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
shingle 1
nails 1
that 1
Tom 1
said 1
would 1
be 1
handy 1
for 1
a 1
prisoner 1
to 1
scrabble 1
his 1
name 1
and 1
sorrows 1
on 1
the 1
dungeon 1
walls 1
with 1
and 1
dropped 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
in 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
s 1
apron 1
pocket 1
which 1
was 1
hanging 1
on 1
a 1
chair 1
and 1
t 1
other 1
we 1
stuck 1
in 1
the 1
band 1
of 1
Uncle 1
Silas 1
s 1
hat 1
which 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
bureau 1
because 1
we 1
heard 1
the 1
children 1
say 1
their 1
pa 1
and 1
ma 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
runaway 1
nigger 1
s 1
house 1
this 1
morning 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
to 1
breakfast 1
and 1
Tom 1
dropped 1
the 1
pewter 1
spoon 1
in 1
Uncle 1
Silas 1
s 1
coat 1
pocket 1
and 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
wasn 1
t 1
come 1
yet 1
so 1
we 1
had 1
to 1
wait 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
And 1
when 1
she 1
come 1
she 1
was 1
hot 1
and 1
red 1
and 1
cross 1
and 1
couldn 1
t 1
hardly 1
wait 1
for 1
the 1
blessing 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
sluicing 1
out 1
coffee 1
with 1
one 1
hand 1
and 1
cracking 1
the 1
handiest 1
child 1
s 1
head 1
with 1
her 1
thimble 1
with 1
the 1
other 1
and 1
says 1
I 1
ve 1
hunted 1
high 1
and 1
I 1
ve 1
hunted 1
low 1
and 1
it 1
does 1
beat 1
all 1
what 1
has 1
become 1
of 1
your 1
other 1
shirt 1
My 1
heart 1
fell 1
down 1
amongst 1
my 1
lungs 1
and 1
livers 1
and 1
things 1
and 1
a 1
hard 1
piece 1
of 1
corn 1
crust 1
started 1
down 1
my 1
throat 1
after 1
it 1
and 1
got 1
met 1
on 1
the 1
road 1
with 1
a 1
cough 1
and 1
was 1
shot 1
across 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
took 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
children 1
in 1
the 1
eye 1
and 1
curled 1
him 1
up 1
like 1
a 1
fishing 1
worm 1
and 1
let 1
a 1
cry 1
out 1
of 1
him 1
the 1
size 1
of 1
a 1
warwhoop 1
and 1
Tom 1
he 1
turned 1
kinder 1
blue 1
around 1
the 1
gills 1
and 1
it 1
all 1
amounted 1
to 1
a 1
considerable 1
state 1
of 1
things 1
for 1
about 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
minute 1
or 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
that 1
and 1
I 1
would 1
a 1
sold 1
out 1
for 1
half 1
price 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
bidder 1
But 1
after 1
that 1
we 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
again 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
sudden 1
surprise 1
of 1
it 1
that 1
knocked 1
us 1
so 1
kind 1
of 1
cold 1
Uncle 1
Silas 1
he 1
says 1
It 1
s 1
most 1
uncommon 1
curious 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
understand 1
it 1
I 1
know 1
perfectly 1
well 1
I 1
took 1
it 1
off 1
because 1
Because 1
you 1
hain 1
t 1
got 1
but 1
one 1
on 1
Just 1
listen 1
at 1
the 1
man 1
I 1
know 1
you 1
took 1
it 1
off 1
and 1
know 1
it 1
by 1
a 1
better 1
way 1
than 1
your 1
wool 1
gethering 1
memory 1
too 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
clo 1
s 1
line 1
yesterday 1
I 1
see 1
it 1
there 1
myself 1
But 1
it 1
s 1
gone 1
that 1
s 1
the 1
long 1
and 1
the 1
short 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
you 1
ll 1
just 1
have 1
to 1
change 1
to 1
a 1
red 1
flann 1
l 1
one 1
till 1
I 1
can 1
get 1
time 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
new 1
one 1
And 1
it 1
ll 1
be 1
the 1
third 1
I 1
ve 1
made 1
in 1
two 1
years 1
It 1
just 1
keeps 1
a 1
body 1
on 1
the 1
jump 1
to 1
keep 1
you 1
in 1
shirts 1
and 1
whatever 1
you 1
do 1
manage 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
m 1
all 1
is 1
more 1
n 1
I 1
can 1
make 1
out 1
A 1
body 1
d 1
think 1
you 1
would 1
learn 1
to 1
take 1
some 1
sort 1
of 1
care 1
of 1
em 1
at 1
your 1
time 1
of 1
life 1
I 1
know 1
it 1
Sally 1
and 1
I 1
do 1
try 1
all 1
I 1
can 1
But 1
it 1
oughtn 1
t 1
to 1
be 1
altogether 1
my 1
fault 1
because 1
you 1
know 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
see 1
them 1
nor 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
them 1
except 1
when 1
they 1
re 1
on 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
believe 1
I 1
ve 1
ever 1
lost 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
off 1
of 1
me 1
Well 1
it 1

fault 1
if 1
you 1

Silas 1

And 1

I 1
wonder 1

off 1
with 1
the 1
whole 1
place 1

Silas 1
you 1

I 1

Well 1

but 1
I 1
won 1
t 1

without 1

Just 1
then 1
the 1
nigger 1

Well 1
she 1
was 1
just 1
a 1
biling 1
I 1
begun 1
to 1
lay 1
for 1
a 1
chance 1
I 1
reckoned 1
I 1
would 1
sneak 1
out 1
and 1
go 1
for 1
the 1
woods 1
till 1
the 1
weather 1
moderated 1
She 1
kept 1
a 1
raging 1
right 1
along 1
running 1
her 1
insurrection 1
all 1
by 1
herself 1
and 1
everybody 1
else 1
mighty 1
meek 1
and 1
quiet 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
Uncle 1
Silas 1
looking 1
kind 1
of 1
foolish 1
fishes 1
up 1
that 1
spoon 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
pocket 1
She 1
stopped 1
with 1
her 1
mouth 1
open 1
and 1
her 1
hands 1
up 1
and 1
as 1
for 1
me 1
I 1
wished 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
Jeruslem 1
or 1
somewheres 1
But 1
not 1
long 1
because 1
she 1
says 1
It 1
s 1
just 1
as 1
I 1
expected 1
So 1
you 1
had 1
it 1
in 1
your 1
pocket 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
like 1
as 1
not 1
you 1
ve 1
got 1
the 1
other 1
things 1
there 1
too 1
How 1
d 1
it 1
get 1
there 1
I 1
reely 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
Sally 1
he 1
says 1
kind 1
of 1
apologizing 1
or 1
you 1
know 1
I 1
would 1
tell 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
studying 1
over 1
my 1
text 1
in 1
Acts 1
Seventeen 1
before 1
breakfast 1
and 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
put 1
it 1
in 1
there 1
not 1
noticing 1
meaning 1
to 1
put 1
my 1
Testament 1
in 1
and 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
so 1
because 1
my 1
Testament 1
ain 1
t 1
in 1
but 1
I 1
ll 1
go 1
and 1
see 1
and 1
if 1
the 1
Testament 1
is 1
where 1
I 1
had 1
it 1
I 1
ll 1
know 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
put 1
it 1
in 1
and 1
that 1
will 1
show 1
that 1
I 1
laid 1
the 1
Testament 1
down 1
and 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
spoon 1
and 1
Oh 1
for 1
the 1
land 1
s 1
sake 1
Give 1
a 1
body 1
a 1
rest 1
Go 1
long 1
now 1
the 1
whole 1
kit 1
and 1
biling 1
of 1
ye 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
come 1
nigh 1
me 1
again 1
till 1
I 1
ve 1
got 1
back 1
my 1
peace 1
of 1
mind 1
I 1
D 1
a 1
heard 1
her 1
if 1
she 1
d 1
a 1
said 1
it 1
to 1
herself 1
let 1
alone 1
speaking 1
it 1
out 1
and 1
I 1
d 1
a 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
obeyed 1
her 1
if 1
I 1
d 1
a 1
been 1
dead 1
As 1
we 1
was 1
passing 1
through 1
the 1
setting 1
room 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
he 1
took 1
up 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
the 1
shingle 1
nail 1
fell 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
he 1
just 1
merely 1
picked 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
laid 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
mantel 1
shelf 1
and 1
never 1
said 1
nothing 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
Tom 1
see 1
him 1
do 1
it 1
and 1
remembered 1
about 1
the 1
spoon 1
and 1
says 1
Well 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
send 1
things 1
by 1
him 1
no 1
more 1
he 1
ain 1
t 1
reliable 1
Then 1
he 1
says 1
But 1
he 1
done 1
us 1
a 1
good 1
turn 1
with 1
the 1
spoon 1
anyway 1
without 1
knowing 1
it 1
and 1
so 1
we 1
ll 1
go 1
and 1
do 1
him 1
one 1
without 1
him 1
knowing 1
it 1
stop 1
up 1
his 1
rat 1
holes 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
noble 1
good 1
lot 1
of 1
them 1
down 1
cellar 1
and 1
it 1
took 1
us 1
a 1
whole 1
hour 1
but 1
we 1
done 1
the 1
job 1
tight 1
and 1
good 1
and 1
shipshape 1
Then 1
we 1
heard 1
steps 1
on 1
the 1
stairs 1
and 1
blowed 1
out 1
our 1
light 1
and 1
hid 1
and 1
here 1
comes 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
candle 1
in 1
one 1
hand 1
and 1
a 1
bundle 1
of 1
stuff 1
in 1
t 1
other 1
looking 1
as 1
absent 1
minded 1
as 1
year 1
before 1
last 1
He 1
went 1
a 1
mooning 1
around 1
first 1
to 1
one 1
rat 1
hole 1
and 1
then 1
another 1
till 1
he 1
d 1
been 1
to 1
them 1
all 1
Then 1
he 1
stood 1
about 1
five 1
minutes 1
picking 1
tallow 1
drip 1
off 1
of 1
his 1
candle 1
and 1
thinking 1
Then 1
he 1
turns 1
off 1
slow 1
and 1
dreamy 1
towards 1
the 1
stairs 1
saying 1
Well 1
for 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
me 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
remember 1
when 1
I 1
done 1
it 1
I 1
could 1
show 1
her 1
now 1
that 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
to 1
blame 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
rats 1
But 1
never 1
mind 1
let 1
it 1
go 1
I 1
reckon 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
do 1
no 1
good 1
And 1
so 1
he 1
went 1
on 1
a 1
mumbling 1
up 1
stairs 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
left 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
mighty 1
nice 1
old 1
man 1
And 1
always 1
is 1
Tom 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
bothered 1
about 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
for 1
a 1
spoon 1
but 1
he 1
said 1
we 1
d 1
got 1
to 1
have 1
it 1
so 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
think 1
When 1
he 1
had 1
ciphered 1
it 1
out 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
how 1
we 1
was 1
to 1
do 1
then 1
we 1
went 1
and 1
waited 1
around 1
the 1
spoon 1
basket 1
till 1
we 1
see 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
coming 1
and 1
then 1
Tom 1
went 1
to 1
counting 1
the 1
spoons 1
and 1
laying 1
them 1
out 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
I 1
slid 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
up 1
my 1
sleeve 1
and 1
Tom 1
says 1
Why 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
but 1
nine 1
spoons 1
yet 1
She 1
says 1
Go 1
long 1
to 1
your 1
play 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
bother 1
me 1
I 1
know 1
better 1
I 1
counted 1
m 1
myself 1
Well 1
I 1
ve 1
counted 1
them 1
twice 1
Aunty 1
and 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
make 1
but 1
nine 1
She 1
looked 1
out 1
of 1
all 1
patience 1
but 1
of 1
course 1
she 1
come 1
to 1
count 1
anybody 1
would 1
I 1
declare 1
to 1
gracious 1
ther 1
ain 1
t 1
but 1
nine 1
she 1
says 1
Why 1
what 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
plague 1
take 1
the 1
things 1
I 1
ll 1
count 1
m 1
again 1
So 1
I 1
slipped 1
back 1
the 1
one 1
I 1
had 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
got 1
done 1
counting 1
she 1
says 1
Hang 1
the 1
troublesome 1
rubbage 1
ther 1
s 1
ten 1
now 1
and 1
she 1
looked 1
huffy 1
and 1
bothered 1
both 1
But 1
Tom 1
says 1
Why 1
Aunty 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
there 1
s 1
ten 1
You 1
numskull 1
didn 1
t 1
you 1
see 1
me 1
count 1
m 1
I 1
know 1
but 1
Well 1
I 1
ll 1
count 1
m 1
again 1
So 1
I 1
smouched 1
one 1
and 1
they 1
come 1
out 1
nine 1
same 1
as 1
the 1
other 1
time 1
Well 1
she 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
tearing 1
way 1
just 1
a 1
trembling 1
all 1
over 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
mad 1
But 1
she 1
counted 1
and 1
counted 1
till 1
she 1
got 1
that 1
addled 1
she 1
d 1
start 1
to 1
count 1
in 1
the 1
basket 1
for 1
a 1
spoon 1
sometimes 1
and 1
so 1
three 1
times 1
they 1
come 1
out 1
right 1
and 1
three 1
times 1
they 1
come 1
out 1
wrong 1
Then 1
she 1
grabbed 1
up 1
the 1
basket 1
and 1
slammed 1
it 1
across 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
knocked 1
the 1
cat 1
galley 1
west 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
cle 1
r 1
out 1
and 1
let 1
her 1
have 1
some 1
peace 1
and 1
if 1
we 1
come 1
bothering 1
around 1
her 1
again 1
betwixt 1
that 1
and 1
dinner 1
she 1
d 1
skin 1
us 1
So 1
we 1
had 1
the 1
odd 1
spoon 1
and 1
dropped 1
it 1
in 1
her 1
apron 1
pocket 1
whilst 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
giving 1
us 1
our 1
sailing 1
orders 1
and 1
Jim 1
got 1
it 1
all 1
right 1
along 1
with 1
her 1
shingle 1
nail 1
before 1
noon 1
We 1
was 1
very 1
well 1
satisfied 1
with 1
this 1
business 1
and 1
Tom 1
allowed 1
it 1
was 1
worth 1
twice 1
the 1
trouble 1
it 1
took 1
because 1
he 1
said 1
now 1
she 1
couldn 1
t 1
ever 1
count 1
them 1
spoons 1
twice 1
alike 1
again 1
to 1
save 1
her 1
life 1
and 1
wouldn 1
t 1
believe 1
she 1
d 1
counted 1
them 1
right 1
if 1
she 1
did 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
after 1
she 1
d 1
about 1
counted 1
her 1
head 1
off 1
for 1
the 1
next 1
three 1
days 1
he 1
judged 1
she 1
d 1
give 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
offer 1
to 1
kill 1
anybody 1
that 1
wanted 1
her 1
to 1
ever 1
count 1
them 1
any 1
more 1
So 1
we 1
put 1
the 1
sheet 1
back 1
on 1
the 1
line 1
that 1
night 1
and 1
stole 1
one 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
closet 1
and 1
kept 1
on 1
putting 1
it 1
back 1
and 1
stealing 1
it 1
again 1
for 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
days 1
till 1
she 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
how 1
many 1
sheets 1
she 1
had 1
any 1
more 1
and 1
she 1
didn 1
t 1
care 1
and 1
warn 1
t 1
a 1
going 1
to 1
bullyrag 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
her 1
soul 1
out 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
wouldn 1
t 1
count 1
them 1
again 1
not 1
to 1
save 1
her 1
life 1
she 1
druther 1
die 1
first 1
So 1
we 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
now 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
shirt 1
and 1
the 1
sheet 1
and 1
the 1
spoon 1
and 1
the 1
candles 1
by 1
the 1
help 1
of 1
the 1
calf 1
and 1
the 1
rats 1
and 1
the 1
mixed 1
up 1
counting 1
and 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
candlestick 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
consequence 1
it 1
would 1
blow 1
over 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
But 1
that 1
pie 1
was 1
a 1
job 1
we 1
had 1
no 1
end 1
of 1
trouble 1
with 1
that 1
pie 1
We 1
fixed 1
it 1
up 1
away 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
cooked 1
it 1
there 1
and 1
we 1
got 1
it 1
done 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
very 1
satisfactory 1
too 1
but 1
not 1
all 1
in 1
one 1
day 1
and 1
we 1
had 1
to 1
use 1
up 1
three 1
wash 1
pans 1
full 1
of 1
flour 1
before 1
we 1
got 1
through 1
and 1
we 1
got 1
burnt 1
pretty 1
much 1
all 1
over 1
in 1
places 1
and 1
eyes 1
put 1
out 1
with 1
the 1
smoke 1
because 1
you 1
see 1
we 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
nothing 1
but 1
a 1
crust 1
and 1
we 1
couldn 1
t 1
prop 1
it 1
up 1
right 1
and 1
she 1
would 1
always 1
cave 1
in 1
But 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
right 1
way 1
at 1
last 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
cook 1
the 1
ladder 1
too 1
in 1
the 1
pie 1
So 1
then 1
we 1
laid 1
in 1
with 1
Jim 1
the 1
second 1
night 1
and 1
tore 1
up 1
the 1
sheet 1
all 1
in 1
little 1
strings 1
and 1
twisted 1
them 1
together 1
and 1
long 1
before 1
daylight 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
lovely 1
rope 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
a 1
hung 1
a 1
person 1
with 1
We 1
let 1
on 1
it 1
took 1
nine 1
months 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
And 1
in 1
the 1
forenoon 1
we 1
took 1
it 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
woods 1
but 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
pie 1
Being 1
made 1
of 1
a 1
whole 1
sheet 1
that 1
way 1
there 1
was 1
rope 1
enough 1
for 1
forty 1
pies 1
if 1
we 1
d 1
a 1
wanted 1
them 1
and 1
plenty 1
left 1
over 1
for 1
soup 1
or 1
sausage 1
or 1
anything 1
you 1
choose 1
We 1
could 1
a 1
had 1
a 1
whole 1
dinner 1
But 1
we 1
didn 1
t 1
need 1
it 1
All 1
we 1
needed 1
was 1
just 1
enough 1
for 1
the 1
pie 1
and 1
so 1
we 1
throwed 1
the 1
rest 1
away 1
We 1
didn 1
t 1
cook 1
none 1
of 1
the 1
pies 1
in 1
the 1
wash 1
pan 1
afraid 1
the 1
solder 1
would 1
melt 1
but 1
Uncle 1
Silas 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
noble 1
brass 1
warming 1
pan 1
which 1
he 1
thought 1
considerable 1
of 1
because 1
it 1
belonged 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
ancesters 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
wooden 1
handle 1
that 1
come 1
over 1
from 1
England 1
with 1
William 1
the 1
Conqueror 1
in 1
the 1
Mayflower 1
or 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
early 1
ships 1
and 1
was 1
hid 1
away 1
up 1
garret 1
with 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
other 1
old 1
pots 1
and 1
things 1
that 1
was 1
valuable 1
not 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
being 1
any 1
account 1
because 1
they 1
warn 1
t 1
but 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
them 1
being 1
relicts 1
you 1
know 1
and 1
we 1
snaked 1
her 1
out 1
private 1
and 1
took 1
her 1
down 1
there 1
but 1
she 1
failed 1
on 1
the 1
first 1
pies 1
because 1
we 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
how 1
but 1
she 1
come 1
up 1
smiling 1
on 1
the 1
last 1
one 1
We 1
took 1
and 1
lined 1
her 1
with 1
dough 1
and 1
set 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
coals 1
and 1
loaded 1
her 1
up 1
with 1
rag 1
rope 1
and 1
put 1
on 1
a 1
dough 1
roof 1
and 1
shut 1
down 1
the 1
lid 1
and 1
put 1
hot 1
embers 1
on 1
top 1
and 1
stood 1
off 1
five 1
foot 1
with 1
the 1
long 1
handle 1
cool 1
and 1
comfortable 1
and 1
in 1
fifteen 1
minutes 1
she 1
turned 1
out 1
a 1
pie 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
satisfaction 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
But 1
the 1
person 1
that 1
et 1
it 1
would 1
want 1
to 1
fetch 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
kags 1
of 1
toothpicks 1
along 1
for 1
if 1
that 1
rope 1
ladder 1
wouldn 1
t 1
cramp 1
him 1
down 1
to 1
business 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
nothing 1
what 1
I 1
m 1
talking 1
about 1
and 1
lay 1
him 1
in 1
enough 1
stomach 1
ache 1
to 1
last 1
him 1
till 1
next 1
time 1
too 1
Nat 1
didn 1
t 1
look 1
when 1
we 1
put 1
the 1
witch 1
pie 1
in 1
Jim 1
s 1
pan 1
and 1
we 1
put 1
the 1
three 1
tin 1
plates 1
in 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
pan 1
under 1
the 1
vittles 1
and 1
so 1
Jim 1
got 1
everything 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
by 1
himself 1
he 1
busted 1
into 1
the 1
pie 1
and 1
hid 1
the 1
rope 1
ladder 1
inside 1
of 1
his 1
straw 1
tick 1
and 1
scratched 1
some 1
marks 1
on 1
a 1
tin 1
plate 1
and 1
throwed 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
hole 1

a 1
bar 1
sinister 1
Oh 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
But 1
he 1
s 1
got 1
to 1
have 1
it 1
All 1
the 1
nobility 1
does 1
That 1
was 1
just 1
his 1
way 1
If 1
it 1
didn 1
t 1
suit 1
him 1
to 1
explain 1
a 1
thing 1
to 1
you 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
do 1
it 1
You 1
might 1
pump 1
at 1
him 1
a 1
week 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
make 1
no 1
difference 1
He 1
d 1
got 1
all 1
that 1
coat 1
of 1
arms 1
business 1
fixed 1
so 1
now 1
he 1
started 1
in 1
to 1
finish 1
up 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
that 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
work 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
plan 1
out 1
a 1
mournful 1
inscription 1
said 1
Jim 1
got 1
to 1
have 1
one 1
like 1
they 1
all 1
done 1
He 1
made 1
up 1
a 1
lot 1
and 1
wrote 1
them 1
out 1
on 1
a 1
paper 1
and 1
read 1
them 1
off 1
so 1
Here 1
a 1
captive 1
heart 1
busted 1
Here 1
a 1
poor 1
prisoner 1
forsook 1
by 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
friends 1
fretted 1
his 1
sorrowful 1
life 1
Here 1
a 1
lonely 1
heart 1
broke 1
and 1
a 1
worn 1
spirit 1
went 1
to 1
its 1
rest 1
after 1
thirty 1
seven 1
years 1
of 1
solitary 1
captivity 1
Here 1
homeless 1
and 1
friendless 1
after 1
thirty 1
seven 1
years 1
of 1
bitter 1
captivity 1
perished 1
a 1
noble 1
stranger 1
natural 1
son 1
of 1
Louis 1
XIV 1
Tom 1
s 1
voice 1
trembled 1
whilst 1
he 1
was 1
reading 1
them 1
and 1
he 1
most 1
broke 1
down 1
When 1
he 1
got 1
done 1
he 1
couldn 1
t 1
no 1
way 1
make 1
up 1
his 1
mind 1
which 1
one 1
for 1
Jim 1
to 1
scrabble 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
wall 1
they 1
was 1
all 1
so 1
good 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
allowed 1
he 1
would 1
let 1
him 1
scrabble 1
them 1
all 1
on 1
Jim 1
said 1
it 1
would 1
take 1
him 1
a 1
year 1
to 1
scrabble 1
such 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
truck 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
logs 1
with 1
a 1
nail 1
and 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
make 1
letters 1
besides 1
but 1
Tom 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
block 1
them 1
out 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
just 1
follow 1
the 1
lines 1
Then 1
pretty 1
soon 1
he 1
says 1
Come 1
to 1
think 1
the 1
logs 1
ain 1
t 1
a 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
have 1
log 1
walls 1
in 1
a 1
dungeon 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
dig 1
the 1
inscriptions 1
into 1
a 1
rock 1
We 1
ll 1
fetch 1
a 1
rock 1
Jim 1
said 1
the 1
rock 1
was 1
worse 1
than 1
the 1
logs 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
would 1
take 1
him 1
such 1
a 1
pison 1
long 1
time 1
to 1
dig 1
them 1
into 1
a 1
rock 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
ever 1
get 1
out 1
But 1
Tom 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
let 1
me 1
help 1
him 1
do 1
it 1
Then 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
look 1
to 1
see 1
how 1
me 1
and 1
Jim 1
was 1
getting 1
along 1
with 1
the 1
pens 1
It 1
was 1
most 1
pesky 1
tedious 1
hard 1
work 1
and 1
slow 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
give 1
my 1
hands 1
no 1
show 1
to 1
get 1
well 1
of 1
the 1
sores 1
and 1
we 1
didn 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
make 1
no 1
headway 1
hardly 1
so 1
Tom 1
says 1
I 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
fix 1
it 1
We 1
got 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
rock 1
for 1
the 1
coat 1
of 1
arms 1
and 1
mournful 1
inscriptions 1
and 1
we 1
can 1
kill 1
two 1
birds 1
with 1
that 1
same 1
rock 1
There 1
s 1
a 1
gaudy 1
big 1
grindstone 1
down 1
at 1
the 1
mill 1
and 1
we 1
ll 1
smouch 1
it 1
and 1
carve 1
the 1
things 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
file 1
out 1
the 1
pens 1
and 1
the 1
saw 1
on 1
it 1
too 1
It 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
slouch 1
of 1
an 1
idea 1
and 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
slouch 1
of 1
a 1
grindstone 1
nuther 1
but 1
we 1
allowed 1
we 1
d 1
tackle 1
it 1
It 1
warn 1
t 1
quite 1
midnight 1
yet 1
so 1
we 1
cleared 1
out 1
for 1
the 1
mill 1
leaving 1
Jim 1
at 1
work 1
We 1
smouched 1
the 1
grindstone 1
and 1
set 1
out 1
to 1
roll 1
her 1
home 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
most 1
nation 1
tough 1
job 1
Sometimes 1
do 1
what 1
we 1
could 1
we 1
couldn 1
t 1
keep 1
her 1
from 1
falling 1
over 1
and 1
she 1
come 1
mighty 1
near 1
mashing 1
us 1
every 1
time 1
Tom 1
said 1
she 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
get 1
one 1
of 1
us 1
sure 1
before 1
we 1
got 1
through 1
We 1
got 1
her 1
half 1
way 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
was 1
plumb 1
played 1
out 1
and 1
most 1
drownded 1
with 1
sweat 1
We 1
see 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
use 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
fetch 1
Jim 1
So 1
he 1
raised 1
up 1
his 1
bed 1
and 1
slid 1
the 1
chain 1
off 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
leg 1
and 1
wrapt 1
it 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
his 1
neck 1
and 1
we 1
crawled 1
out 1
through 1
our 1
hole 1
and 1
down 1
there 1
and 1
Jim 1
and 1
me 1
laid 1
into 1
that 1
grindstone 1
and 1
walked 1
her 1
along 1
like 1
nothing 1
and 1
Tom 1
superintended 1
He 1
could 1
out 1
superintend 1
any 1
boy 1
I 1
ever 1
see 1
He 1
knowed 1
how 1
to 1
do 1
everything 1
Our 1
hole 1
was 1
pretty 1
big 1
but 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
big 1
enough 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
grindstone 1
through 1
but 1
Jim 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
pick 1
and 1
soon 1
made 1
it 1
big 1
enough 1
Then 1
Tom 1
marked 1
out 1
them 1
things 1
on 1
it 1
with 1
the 1
nail 1
and 1
set 1
Jim 1
to 1
work 1
on 1
them 1
with 1
the 1
nail 1
for 1
a 1
chisel 1
and 1
an 1
iron 1
bolt 1
from 1
the 1
rubbage 1
in 1
the 1
lean 1
to 1
for 1
a 1
hammer 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
to 1
work 1
till 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
his 1
candle 1
quit 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
could 1
go 1
to 1
bed 1
and 1
hide 1
the 1
grindstone 1
under 1
his 1
straw 1
tick 1
and 1
sleep 1
on 1
it 1
Then 1
we 1
helped 1
him 1
fix 1
his 1
chain 1
back 1
on 1
the 1
bed 1
leg 1
and 1
was 1
ready 1
for 1
bed 1
ourselves 1
But 1
Tom 1
thought 1
of 1
something 1
and 1
says 1
You 1
got 1
any 1
spiders 1
in 1
here 1
Jim 1
No 1

Tom 1
thought 1
a 1
minute 1
or 1
two 1
and 1
says 1
It 1
s 1
a 1
good 1
idea 1
And 1
I 1
reckon 1

You 1

skasely 1
ever 1

So 1
Tom 1
was 1
stumped 1
But 1
he 1
studied 1
it 1
over 1
and 1
then 1
said 1
Jim 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
worry 1
along 1
the 1
best 1
he 1
could 1
with 1
an 1
onion 1
He 1
promised 1
he 1
would 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
nigger 1
cabins 1
and 1
drop 1
one 1
private 1
in 1
Jim 1
s 1
coffee 1
pot 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
Jim 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
jis 1
s 1
soon 1
have 1
tobacker 1
in 1
his 1
coffee 1
and 1
found 1
so 1
much 1
fault 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
work 1
and 1
bother 1
of 1
raising 1
the 1
mullen 1
and 1
jews 1
harping 1
the 1
rats 1
and 1
petting 1
and 1
flattering 1
up 1
the 1
snakes 1
and 1
spiders 1
and 1
things 1
on 1
top 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
work 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
on 1
pens 1
and 1
inscriptions 1
and 1
journals 1
and 1
things 1
which 1
made 1
it 1
more 1
trouble 1
and 1
worry 1
and 1
responsibility 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
prisoner 1
than 1
anything 1
he 1
ever 1
undertook 1
that 1
Tom 1
most 1
lost 1
all 1
patience 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
just 1
loadened 1
down 1
with 1
more 1
gaudier 1
chances 1
than 1
a 1
prisoner 1
ever 1
had 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
name 1
for 1
himself 1
and 1
yet 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
enough 1
to 1
appreciate 1
them 1
and 1
they 1
was 1
just 1
about 1
wasted 1
on 1
him 1
So 1
Jim 1
he 1
was 1
sorry 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
behave 1
so 1
no 1
more 1
and 1
then 1
me 1
and 1
Tom 1
shoved 1
for 1
bed 1
CHAPTER 1
XXXIX 1
IN 1
the 1
morning 1
we 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
bought 1
a 1
wire 1
rat 1
trap 1
and 1
fetched 1
it 1
down 1
and 1
unstopped 1
the 1
best 1
rat 1
hole 1
and 1
in 1
about 1
an 1
hour 1
we 1
had 1
fifteen 1
of 1
the 1
bulliest 1
kind 1
of 1
ones 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
took 1
it 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
safe 1
place 1
under 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
s 1
bed 1
But 1
while 1
we 1
was 1
gone 1
for 1
spiders 1
little 1
Thomas 1
Franklin 1
Benjamin 1
Jefferson 1
Elexander 1
Phelps 1
found 1
it 1
there 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
it 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
the 1
rats 1
would 1
come 1
out 1
and 1
they 1
did 1
and 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
she 1
come 1
in 1
and 1
when 1
we 1
got 1
back 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
standing 1
on 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
raising 1
Cain 1
and 1
the 1
rats 1
was 1
doing 1
what 1
they 1
could 1
to 1
keep 1
off 1
the 1
dull 1
times 1
for 1
her 1
So 1
she 1
took 1
and 1
dusted 1
us 1
both 1
with 1
the 1
hickry 1
and 1
we 1
was 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
two 1
hours 1
catching 1
another 1
fifteen 1
or 1
sixteen 1
drat 1
that 1
meddlesome 1
cub 1
and 1
they 1
warn 1
t 1
the 1
likeliest 1
nuther 1
because 1
the 1
first 1
haul 1
was 1
the 1
pick 1
of 1
the 1
flock 1
I 1
never 1
see 1
a 1
likelier 1
lot 1
of 1
rats 1
than 1
what 1
that 1
first 1
haul 1
was 1
We 1
got 1
a 1
splendid 1
stock 1
of 1
sorted 1
spiders 1
and 1
bugs 1
and 1
frogs 1
and 1
caterpillars 1
and 1
one 1
thing 1
or 1
another 1
and 1
we 1
like 1
to 1
got 1
a 1
hornet 1
s 1
nest 1
but 1
we 1
didn 1
t 1
The 1
family 1
was 1
at 1
home 1
We 1
didn 1
t 1
give 1
it 1
right 1
up 1
but 1
stayed 1
with 1
them 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
we 1
could 1
because 1
we 1
allowed 1
we 1
d 1
tire 1
them 1
out 1
or 1
they 1
d 1
got 1
to 1
tire 1
us 1
out 1
and 1
they 1
done 1
it 1
Then 1
we 1
got 1
allycumpain 1
and 1
rubbed 1
on 1
the 1
places 1
and 1
was 1
pretty 1
near 1
all 1
right 1
again 1
but 1
couldn 1
t 1
set 1
down 1
convenient 1
And 1
so 1
we 1
went 1
for 1
the 1
snakes 1
and 1
grabbed 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
dozen 1
garters 1
and 1
house 1
snakes 1
and 1
put 1
them 1
in 1
a 1
bag 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
in 1
our 1
room 1
and 1
by 1
that 1
time 1
it 1
was 1
supper 1
time 1
and 1
a 1
rattling 1
good 1
honest 1
day 1
s 1
work 1
and 1
hungry 1
oh 1
no 1
I 1
reckon 1
not 1
And 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
a 1
blessed 1
snake 1
up 1
there 1
when 1
we 1
went 1
back 1
we 1
didn 1
t 1
half 1
tie 1
the 1
sack 1
and 1
they 1
worked 1
out 1
somehow 1
and 1
left 1
But 1
it 1
didn 1
t 1
matter 1
much 1
because 1
they 1
was 1
still 1
on 1
the 1
premises 1
somewheres 1
So 1
we 1
judged 1
we 1
could 1
get 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
again 1
No 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
real 1
scarcity 1
of 1
snakes 1
about 1
the 1
house 1
for 1
a 1
considerable 1
spell 1
You 1
d 1
see 1
them 1
dripping 1
from 1
the 1
rafters 1
and 1
places 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
and 1
they 1
generly 1
landed 1
in 1
your 1
plate 1
or 1
down 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
your 1
neck 1
and 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
where 1
you 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
them 1
Well 1
they 1
was 1
handsome 1
and 1
striped 1
and 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
harm 1
in 1
a 1
million 1
of 1
them 1
but 1
that 1
never 1
made 1
no 1
difference 1
to 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
she 1
despised 1
snakes 1
be 1
the 1
breed 1
what 1
they 1
might 1
and 1
she 1
couldn 1
t 1
stand 1
them 1
no 1
way 1
you 1
could 1
fix 1
it 1
and 1
every 1
time 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
flopped 1
down 1
on 1
her 1
it 1
didn 1
t 1
make 1
no 1
difference 1
what 1
she 1
was 1
doing 1
she 1
would 1
just 1
lay 1
that 1
work 1
down 1
and 1
light 1
out 1
I 1
never 1
see 1
such 1
a 1
woman 1
And 1
you 1
could 1
hear 1
her 1
whoop 1
to 1
Jericho 1
You 1
couldn 1
t 1
get 1
her 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
holt 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
with 1
the 1
tongs 1
And 1
if 1
she 1
turned 1
over 1
and 1
found 1
one 1
in 1
bed 1
she 1
would 1
scramble 1
out 1
and 1
lift 1
a 1
howl 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
think 1
the 1
house 1
was 1
afire 1
She 1
disturbed 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
could 1
most 1
wish 1
there 1
hadn 1
t 1
ever 1
been 1
no 1
snakes 1
created 1
Why 1
after 1
every 1
last 1
snake 1
had 1
been 1
gone 1
clear 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
for 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
a 1
week 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
warn 1
t 1
over 1
it 1
yet 1
she 1
warn 1
t 1
near 1
over 1
it 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
setting 1
thinking 1
about 1
something 1
you 1
could 1
touch 1
her 1
on 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
her 1
neck 1
with 1
a 1
feather 1
and 1
she 1
would 1
jump 1
right 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
stockings 1
It 1
was 1
very 1
curious 1
But 1
Tom 1
said 1
all 1
women 1
was 1
just 1
so 1
He 1
said 1
they 1
was 1
made 1
that 1
way 1
for 1
some 1
reason 1
or 1
other 1
We 1
got 1
a 1
licking 1
every 1
time 1
one 1
of 1
our 1
snakes 1
come 1
in 1
her 1
way 1
and 1
she 1
allowed 1
these 1
lickings 1
warn 1
t 1
nothing 1
to 1
what 1
she 1
would 1
do 1
if 1
we 1
ever 1
loaded 1
up 1
the 1
place 1
again 1
with 1
them 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
mind 1
the 1
lickings 1
because 1
they 1
didn 1
t 1
amount 1
to 1
nothing 1
but 1
I 1
minded 1
the 1
trouble 1
we 1
had 1
to 1
lay 1
in 1
another 1
lot 1
But 1
we 1
got 1
them 1
laid 1
in 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
things 1
and 1
you 1
never 1
see 1
a 1
cabin 1
as 1
blithesome 1
as 1
Jim 1
s 1
was 1
when 1
they 1
d 1
all 1
swarm 1
out 1
for 1
music 1
and 1
go 1
for 1
him 1
Jim 1
didn 1
t 1
like 1
the 1
spiders 1
and 1
the 1
spiders 1
didn 1
t 1
like 1
Jim 1
and 1
so 1
they 1
d 1
lay 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
make 1
it 1
mighty 1
warm 1
for 1
him 1
And 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
between 1
the 1
rats 1
and 1
the 1
snakes 1
and 1
the 1
grindstone 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
room 1
in 1
bed 1
for 1
him 1
skasely 1
and 1
when 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
body 1
couldn 1
t 1
sleep 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
lively 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
always 1
lively 1
he 1
said 1
because 1
they 1
never 1
all 1
slept 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
but 1
took 1
turn 1
about 1
so 1
when 1
the 1
snakes 1
was 1
asleep 1
the 1
rats 1
was 1
on 1
deck 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
rats 1
turned 1
in 1
the 1
snakes 1
come 1
on 1
watch 1
so 1
he 1
always 1
had 1
one 1
gang 1
under 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
way 1
and 1
t 1
other 1
gang 1
having 1
a 1
circus 1
over 1
him 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
to 1
hunt 1
a 1
new 1
place 1
the 1
spiders 1
would 1
take 1
a 1
chance 1
at 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
crossed 1
over 1
He 1
said 1
if 1
he 1
ever 1
got 1
out 1
this 1
time 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
ever 1
be 1
a 1
prisoner 1
again 1
not 1
for 1
a 1
salary 1
Well 1
by 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
three 1
weeks 1
everything 1
was 1
in 1
pretty 1
good 1
shape 1
The 1
shirt 1
was 1
sent 1
in 1
early 1
in 1
a 1
pie 1
and 1
every 1
time 1
a 1
rat 1
bit 1
Jim 1
he 1
would 1
get 1
up 1
and 1
write 1
a 1
little 1
in 1
his 1
journal 1
whilst 1
the 1
ink 1
was 1
fresh 1
the 1
pens 1
was 1
made 1
the 1
inscriptions 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
was 1
all 1
carved 1
on 1
the 1
grindstone 1
the 1
bed 1
leg 1
was 1
sawed 1
in 1
two 1
and 1
we 1
had 1
et 1
up 1
the 1
sawdust 1
and 1
it 1
give 1
us 1
a 1
most 1
amazing 1
stomach 1
ache 1
We 1
reckoned 1
we 1
was 1
all 1
going 1
to 1
die 1
but 1
didn 1
t 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
undigestible 1
sawdust 1
I 1
ever 1
see 1
and 1
Tom 1
said 1
the 1
same 1
But 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
saying 1
we 1
d 1
got 1
all 1
the 1
work 1
done 1
now 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
we 1
was 1
all 1
pretty 1
much 1
fagged 1
out 1
too 1
but 1
mainly 1
Jim 1
The 1
old 1
man 1
had 1
wrote 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
times 1
to 1
the 1
plantation 1
below 1
Orleans 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
get 1
their 1
runaway 1
nigger 1
but 1
hadn 1
t 1
got 1
no 1
answer 1
because 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
such 1
plantation 1
so 1
he 1
allowed 1
he 1
would 1
advertise 1
Jim 1
in 1
the 1
St 1
Louis 1
and 1
New 1
Orleans 1
papers 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
mentioned 1
the 1
St 1
Louis 1
ones 1
it 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
cold 1
shivers 1
and 1
I 1
see 1
we 1
hadn 1
t 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
lose 1
So 1
Tom 1
said 1
now 1
for 1
the 1
nonnamous 1
letters 1
What 1
s 1
them 1
I 1
says 1
Warnings 1
to 1
the 1
people 1
that 1
something 1
is 1
up 1
Sometimes 1
it 1
s 1
done 1
one 1
way 1
sometimes 1
another 1
But 1
there 1
s 1
always 1
somebody 1
spying 1
around 1
that 1
gives 1
notice 1
to 1
the 1
governor 1
of 1
the 1
castle 1
When 1
Louis 1
XVI 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
light 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
Tooleries 1
a 1
servant 1
girl 1
done 1
it 1
It 1
s 1
a 1
very 1
good 1
way 1
and 1
so 1
is 1
the 1
nonnamous 1
letters 1
We 1
ll 1
use 1
them 1
both 1
And 1
it 1
s 1
usual 1
for 1
the 1
prisoner 1
s 1
mother 1
to 1
change 1
clothes 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
she 1
stays 1
in 1
and 1
he 1
slides 1
out 1
in 1
her 1
clothes 1
We 1
ll 1
do 1
that 1
too 1
But 1
looky 1
here 1
Tom 1
what 1
do 1
we 1
want 1
to 1
warn 1
anybody 1
for 1
that 1
something 1
s 1
up 1
Let 1
them 1
find 1
it 1
out 1
for 1
themselves 1
it 1
s 1
their 1
lookout 1
Yes 1
I 1
know 1
but 1
you 1
can 1
t 1
depend 1
on 1
them 1
It 1
s 1
the 1
way 1
they 1
ve 1
acted 1
from 1
the 1
very 1
start 1
left 1
us 1
to 1
do 1
everything 1
They 1
re 1
so 1
confiding 1
and 1
mullet 1
headed 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
take 1
notice 1
of 1
nothing 1
at 1
all 1
So 1
if 1
we 1
don 1
t 1
give 1
them 1
notice 1
there 1
won 1
t 1
be 1
nobody 1
nor 1
nothing 1
to 1
interfere 1
with 1
us 1
and 1
so 1
after 1
all 1
our 1
hard 1
work 1
and 1
trouble 1
this 1
escape 1
ll 1
go 1
off 1
perfectly 1
flat 1
won 1
t 1
amount 1
to 1
nothing 1
won 1
t 1
be 1
nothing 1
to 1
it 1
Well 1
as 1
for 1
me 1
Tom 1
that 1
s 1
the 1
way 1
I 1
d 1

Shucks 1

disgusted 1
So 1
I 1
says 1
But 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
going 1
to 1
make 1
no 1
complaint 1
Any 1
way 1

What 1

servant 1
girl 1
You 1

middle 1

Why 1

minutes 1
to 1

the 1
nonnamous 1
letter 1
and 1

the 1
front 1
door 1
All 1

then 1
I 1

but 1
I 1
could 1
carry 1
it 1
just 1

togs 1
You 1

No 1
but 1

I 1

like 1
anyway 1
That 1
ain 1
t 1
got 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
The 1
thing 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
do 1
is 1
just 1
to 1
do 1
our 1
duty 1
and 1
not 1
worry 1
about 1
whether 1
anybody 1
sees 1
us 1
do 1
it 1
or 1
not 1
Hain 1
t 1
you 1

All 1
right 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
saying 1
nothing 1
I 1
m 1
the 1
servant 1
girl 1
Who 1
s 1
Jim 1
s 1
mother 1
I 1
m 1
his 1
mother 1
I 1
ll 1
hook 1
a 1
gown 1
from 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
Well 1
then 1
you 1
ll 1
have 1
to 1
stay 1
in 1
the 1
cabin 1
when 1
me 1
and 1
Jim 1
leaves 1
Not 1
much 1
I 1
ll 1
stuff 1
Jim 1
s 1
clothes 1
full 1
of 1
straw 1
and 1
lay 1
it 1
on 1
his 1
bed 1
to 1
represent 1
his 1
mother 1
in 1
disguise 1
and 1
Jim 1
ll 1
take 1
the 1
nigger 1
woman 1
s 1
gown 1
off 1
of 1
me 1
and 1
wear 1
it 1
and 1
we 1
ll 1
all 1
evade 1
together 1
When 1
a 1
prisoner 1
of 1
style 1
escapes 1
it 1
s 1
called 1
an 1
evasion 1
It 1
s 1
always 1
called 1
so 1
when 1
a 1
king 1
escapes 1
f 1
rinstance 1
And 1
the 1
same 1
with 1
a 1
king 1
s 1
son 1
it 1
don 1
t 1
make 1
no 1
difference 1
whether 1
he 1
s 1
a 1
natural 1
one 1
or 1
an 1
unnatural 1
one 1
So 1
Tom 1
he 1
wrote 1
the 1
nonnamous 1
letter 1
and 1
I 1
smouched 1
the 1
yaller 1
wench 1
s 1
frock 1
that 1
night 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
on 1
and 1
shoved 1
it 1
under 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
the 1
way 1
Tom 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
It 1
said 1
Beware 1
Trouble 1
is 1
brewing 1
Keep 1
a 1
sharp 1
lookout 1
Unknown 1
Friend 1
Next 1
night 1
we 1
stuck 1
a 1
picture 1
which 1
Tom 1
drawed 1
in 1
blood 1
of 1
a 1
skull 1
and 1
crossbones 1
on 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
and 1
next 1
night 1
another 1
one 1
of 1
a 1
coffin 1
on 1
the 1
back 1
door 1
I 1
never 1
see 1
a 1
family 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
sweat 1
They 1
couldn 1
t 1
a 1
been 1
worse 1
scared 1
if 1
the 1
place 1
had 1
a 1
been 1
full 1
of 1
ghosts 1
laying 1
for 1
them 1
behind 1
everything 1
and 1
under 1
the 1
beds 1
and 1
shivering 1
through 1
the 1
air 1
If 1
a 1
door 1
banged 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
she 1
jumped 1
and 1
said 1
ouch 1
if 1
anything 1
fell 1
she 1
jumped 1
and 1
said 1
ouch 1
if 1
you 1
happened 1
to 1
touch 1
her 1
when 1
she 1
warn 1
t 1
noticing 1
she 1
done 1
the 1
same 1
she 1
couldn 1
t 1
face 1
noway 1
and 1
be 1
satisfied 1
because 1
she 1
allowed 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
behind 1
her 1
every 1
time 1
so 1
she 1
was 1
always 1
a 1
whirling 1
around 1
sudden 1
and 1
saying 1
ouch 1
and 1
before 1
she 1
d 1
got 1
two 1
thirds 1
around 1
she 1
d 1
whirl 1
back 1
again 1
and 1
say 1
it 1
again 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
afraid 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
bed 1
but 1
she 1
dasn 1
t 1
set 1
up 1
So 1
the 1
thing 1
was 1
working 1
very 1
well 1
Tom 1
said 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
never 1
see 1
a 1
thing 1
work 1
more 1
satisfactory 1
He 1
said 1
it 1
showed 1
it 1
was 1
done 1
right 1
So 1
he 1
said 1
now 1
for 1
the 1
grand 1
bulge 1
So 1
the 1
very 1
next 1
morning 1
at 1
the 1
streak 1
of 1
dawn 1
we 1
got 1
another 1
letter 1
ready 1
and 1
was 1
wondering 1
what 1
we 1
better 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
because 1
we 1
heard 1
them 1
say 1
at 1
supper 1
they 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
nigger 1
on 1
watch 1
at 1
both 1
doors 1
all 1
night 1
Tom 1
he 1
went 1
down 1
the 1
lightning 1
rod 1
to 1
spy 1
around 1
and 1
the 1
nigger 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
door 1
was 1
asleep 1
and 1
he 1
stuck 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
his 1
neck 1
and 1
come 1
back 1
This 1
letter 1
said 1
Don 1

but 1
stead 1
of 1
that 1
I 1
will 1
baa 1

soon 1
as 1
they 1

strange 1
things 1
going 1
on 1
she 1
was 1
just 1
in 1
a 1
sweat 1
about 1
every 1
little 1
thing 1
that 1
warn 1
t 1
yard 1
stick 1
straight 1
so 1
she 1
says 1
very 1
decided 1
You 1

into 1
that 1
setting 1
room 1
and 1

ll 1
find 1
out 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
before 1

M 1

So 1
she 1
went 1
away 1
as 1
I 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
walked 1
into 1
the 1
setting 1
room 1
My 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
crowd 1
there 1
Fifteen 1
farmers 1
and 1
every 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
had 1
a 1
gun 1
I 1
was 1
most 1
powerful 1
sick 1
and 1
slunk 1
to 1
a 1
chair 1
and 1
set 1
down 1
They 1
was 1
setting 1
around 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
talking 1
a 1
little 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
voice 1
and 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
fidgety 1
and 1
uneasy 1
but 1
trying 1
to 1
look 1
like 1
they 1
warn 1
t 1
but 1
I 1
knowed 1
they 1
was 1
because 1
they 1
was 1
always 1
taking 1
off 1
their 1
hats 1
and 1
putting 1
them 1
on 1
and 1
scratching 1
their 1
heads 1
and 1
changing 1
their 1
seats 1
and 1
fumbling 1
with 1
their 1
buttons 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
easy 1
myself 1
but 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
take 1
my 1
hat 1
off 1
all 1
the 1
same 1
I 1
did 1
wish 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
would 1
come 1
and 1
get 1
done 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
lick 1
me 1
if 1
she 1
wanted 1

let 1
me 1
get 1
away 1
and 1
tell 1
Tom 1

thing 1
and 1
what 1
a 1
thundering 1
hornet 1

d 1
got 1
ourselves 1
into 1
so 1
we 1
could 1
stop 1
fooling 1
around 1
straight 1
off 1
and 1
clear 1
out 1
with 1
Jim 1
before 1
these 1
rips 1
got 1
out 1
of 1
patience 1
and 1
come 1
for 1
us 1
At 1
last 1
she 1
come 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
ask 1
me 1
questions 1
but 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
answer 1
them 1
straight 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
which 1
end 1
of 1
me 1
was 1
up 1
because 1
these 1
men 1
was 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
fidget 1
now 1
that 1
some 1
was 1
wanting 1
to 1
start 1
right 1
NOW 1
and 1
lay 1
for 1
them 1
desperadoes 1
and 1
saying 1

but 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
to 1

and 1
others 1

trying 1
to 1
get 1
them 1
to 1
hold 1
on 1
and 1
wait 1
for 1
the 1
sheep 1

and 1
here 1

Aunty 1
pegging 1
away 1
at 1
the 1
questions 1
and 1
me 1
a 1
shaking 1
all 1
over 1
and 1
ready 1
to 1
sink 1
down 1
in 1
my 1
tracks 1
I 1
was 1
that 1
scared 1
and 1
the 1
place 1
getting 1
hotter 1
and 1
hotter 1
and 1
the 1
butter 1
beginning 1
to 1
melt 1
and 1
run 1
down 1
my 1
neck 1
and 1
behind 1
my 1
ears 1
and 1
pretty 1
soon 1
when 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
says 1

dropped 1
and 1
a 1
streak 1
of 1
butter 1
come 1
a 1
trickling 1
down 1
my 1
forehead 1
and 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
she 1
see 1
it 1
and 1
turns 1
white 1
as 1
a 1
sheet 1
and 1
says 1
For 1
the 1
land 1
s 1
sake 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
matter 1
with 1
the 1
child 1
He 1
s 1

fever 1
as 1
shore 1
as 1

and 1
they 1
re 1
oozing 1
out 1
And 1
everybody 1
runs 1
to 1

and 1
she 1
snatches 1
off 1
my 1
hat 1
and 1
out 1
comes 1
the 1
bread 1
and 1
what 1
was 1
left 1
of 1
the 1
butter 1
and 1
she 1
grabbed 1
me 1
and 1
hugged 1
me 1
and 1
says 1
Oh 1

turn 1

and 1

never 1
rains 1
but 1
it 1
pours 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
see 1
that 1
truck 1
I 1
thought 1
we 1
d 1
lost 1
you 1
for 1
I 1
knowed 1
by 1
the 1
color 1
and 1
all 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
like 1
your 1
brains 1
would 1
be 1
if 1
Dear 1

and 1

more 1
of 1

till 1
morning 1
I 1
was 1
up 1
stairs 1
in 1
a 1
second 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
lightning 1
rod 1
in 1
another 1
one 1
and 1
shinning 1
through 1
the 1
dark 1
for 1
the 1
lean 1
to 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
hardly 1
get 1
my 1
words 1
out 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
anxious 1
but 1
I 1
told 1
Tom 1
as 1
quick 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
we 1
must 1
jump 1
for 1
it 1
now 1
and 1
not 1
a 1
minute 1
to 1
lose 1
the 1
house 1
full 1
of 1
men 1
yonder 1
with 1
guns 1
His 1
eyes 1
just 1
blazed 1
and 1
he 1
says 1
No 1
is 1
that 1
so 1
ain 1
t 1
it 1
bully 1
Why 1
Huck 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
do 1
over 1
again 1
I 1
bet 1
I 1
could 1
fetch 1
two 1
hundred 1
If 1
we 1
could 1
put 1
it 1
off 1
till 1
Hurry 2
I 1
says 1
Where 1
s 1
Jim 1
Right 1
at 1
your 1
elbow 1
if 1
you 1
reach 1
out 1
your 1
arm 1
you 1
can 1
touch 1
him 1
He 1
s 1
dressed 1
and 1
everything 1
s 1
ready 1
Now 1
we 1
ll 1
slide 1
out 1
and 1
give 1
the 1
sheep 1
signal 1
But 1
then 1
we 1
heard 1
the 1
tramp 1
of 1
men 1
coming 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
heard 1
them 1
begin 1
to 1
fumble 1
with 1
the 1
pad 1
lock 1
and 1
heard 1
a 1
man 1
say 1
I 1
told 1
you 1
we 1
d 1
be 1
too 1
soon 1
they 1
haven 1
t 1
come 1
the 1
door 1
is 1
locked 1
Here 1
I 1
ll 1
lock 1
some 1
of 1
you 1
into 1
the 1
cabin 1
and 1
you 1
lay 1
for 1
em 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
and 1
kill 1
em 1
when 1
they 1
come 1
and 1
the 1
rest 1
scatter 1
around 1
a 1
piece 1
and 1
listen 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
hear 1
em 1
coming 1
So 1
in 1
they 1
come 1
but 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
us 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
and 1
most 1
trod 1
on 1
us 1
whilst 1
we 1
was 1
hustling 1
to 1
get 1
under 1
the 1
bed 1
But 1
we 1
got 1
under 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
out 1
through 1
the 1
hole 1
swift 1
but 1
soft 1
Jim 1
first 1
me 1
next 1
and 1
Tom 1
last 1
which 1
was 1
according 1
to 1
Tom 1
s 1
orders 1
Now 1
we 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
lean 1
to 1
and 1
heard 1
trampings 1
close 1
by 1
outside 1
So 1
we 1
crept 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
Tom 1
stopped 1
us 1
there 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
eye 1
to 1
the 1
crack 1
but 1
couldn 1
t 1
make 1
out 1
nothing 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
dark 1
and 1
whispered 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
listen 1
for 1
the 1
steps 1
to 1
get 1
further 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
nudged 1
us 1
Jim 1
must 1
glide 1
out 1
first 1
and 1
him 1
last 1
So 1
he 1
set 1
his 1
ear 1
to 1
the 1
crack 1
and 1
listened 1
and 1
listened 1
and 1
listened 1
and 1
the 1
steps 1
a 1
scraping 1
around 1
out 1
there 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
nudged 1
us 1
and 1
we 1
slid 1
out 1
and 1
stooped 1
down 1
not 1
breathing 1
and 1
not 1
making 1
the 1
least 1
noise 1
and 1
slipped 1
stealthy 1
towards 1
the 1
fence 1
in 1
Injun 1
file 1
and 1
got 1
to 1
it 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
me 1
and 1
Jim 1
over 1
it 1
but 1
Tom 1
s 1
britches 1
catched 1
fast 1
on 1
a 1
splinter 1
on 1
the 1
top 1
rail 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
hear 1
the 1
steps 1
coming 1
so 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
pull 1
loose 1
which 1
snapped 1
the 1
splinter 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
noise 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
dropped 1
in 1
our 1
tracks 1
and 1
started 1
somebody 1
sings 1
out 1
Who 1
s 1
that 1
Answer 1
or 1
I 1
ll 1
shoot 1
But 1
we 1
didn 1
t 1
answer 1
we 1
just 1
unfurled 1
our 1
heels 1
and 1
shoved 1
Then 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
rush 1
and 1
a 1
Bang 3
and 1
the 1
bullets 1
fairly 1
whizzed 1
around 1
us 1
We 1
heard 1
them 1
sing 1
out 1
Here 1
they 1
are 1
They 1
ve 1
broke 1
for 1
the 1
river 1
After 1
em 1
boys 1
and 1
turn 1
loose 1
the 1
dogs 1
So 1
here 1
they 1
come 1
full 1
tilt 1
We 1
could 1
hear 1
them 1
because 1
they 1
wore 1
boots 1
and 1
yelled 1
but 1
we 1
didn 1
t 1
wear 1
no 1
boots 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
yell 1
We 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
path 1
to 1
the 1
mill 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
got 1
pretty 1
close 1
on 1
to 1
us 1
we 1
dodged 1
into 1
the 1
bush 1
and 1
let 1
them 1
go 1
by 1
and 1
then 1
dropped 1
in 1
behind 1
them 1
They 1
d 1
had 1
all 1
the 1
dogs 1
shut 1
up 1
so 1
they 1
wouldn 1
t 1
scare 1
off 1
the 1
robbers 1
but 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
somebody 1
had 1
let 1
them 1
loose 1
and 1
here 1
they 1
come 1
making 1
powwow 1
enough 1
for 1
a 1
million 1
but 1
they 1
was 1
our 1
dogs 1
so 1
we 1
stopped 1
in 1
our 1
tracks 1
till 1
they 1
catched 1
up 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
see 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
nobody 1
but 1
us 1
and 1
no 1
excitement 1
to 1
offer 1
them 1
they 1
only 1
just 1
said 1
howdy 1
and 1
tore 1
right 1
ahead 1
towards 1
the 1
shouting 1
and 1
clattering 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
up 1
steam 1
again 1
and 1
whizzed 1
along 1
after 1
them 1
till 1
we 1
was 1
nearly 1
to 1
the 1
mill 1
and 1
then 1
struck 1
up 1
through 1
the 1
bush 1
to 1
where 1
my 1
canoe 1
was 1
tied 1
and 1
hopped 1
in 1
and 1
pulled 1
for 1
dear 1
life 1
towards 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
but 1
didn 1
t 1
make 1
no 1
more 1
noise 1
than 1
we 1
was 1
obleeged 1
to 1
Then 1
we 1
struck 1
out 1
easy 1
and 1
comfortable 1
for 1
the 1
island 1
where 1
my 1
raft 1
was 1
and 1
we 1
could 1
hear 1
them 1
yelling 1
and 1
barking 1
at 1
each 1
other 1
all 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
bank 1
till 1
we 1
was 1
so 1
far 1
away 1
the 1
sounds 1
got 1
dim 1
and 1
died 1
out 1
And 1
when 1
we 1
stepped 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
raft 1
I 1
says 1
Now 1
old 1

and 1
I 1

Tom 1
was 1
the 1
gladdest 1
of 1
all 1
because 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
bullet 1
in 1
the 1
calf 1
of 1
his 1
leg 1
When 1
me 1
and 1
Jim 1
heard 1
that 1
we 1
didn 1
t 1
feel 1
so 1
brash 1
as 1

we 1
did 1
before 1
It 1
was 1
hurting 1
him 1
considerable 1
and 1
bleeding 1
so 1
we 1
laid 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
wigwam 1
and 1
tore 1
up 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
duke 1

shirts 1
for 1
to 1

it 1
s 1
forty 1
year 1
I 1
knowed 1
he 1
was 1
white 1
inside 1
and 1
I 1
reckoned 1
he 1
d 1

what 1
he 1
did 1
say 1
so 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
now 1
and 1
I 1
told 1
Tom 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
going 1
for 1
a 1
doctor 1
He 1
raised 1
considerable 1
row 1
about 1
it 1
but 1
me 1
and 1
Jim 1
stuck 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
wouldn 1
t 1
budge 1
so 1
he 1
was 1
for 1
crawling 1
out 1
and 1
setting 1
the 1
raft 1
loose 1
himself 1
but 1
we 1
wouldn 1
t 1
let 1
him 1
Then 1
he 1
give 1
us 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
his 1
mind 1
but 1
it 1
didn 1
t 1
do 1
no 1
good 1
So 1
when 1
he 1
sees 1
me 1
getting 1
the 1
canoe 1
ready 1
he 1
says 1
Well 1
then 1
if 1
you 1
re 1
bound 1
to 1
go 1
I 1
ll 1
tell 1
you 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
do 1
when 1
you 1
get 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
Shut 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
blindfold 1
the 1
doctor 1
tight 1
and 1
fast 1
and 1
make 1
him 1
swear 1
to 1
be 1
silent 1
as 1
the 1
grave 1
and 1
put 1
a 1
purse 1
full 1
of 1
gold 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
then 1
take 1
and 1
lead 1
him 1
all 1
around 1
the 1
back 1
alleys 1
and 1
everywheres 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
and 1
then 1
fetch 1
him 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
in 1
a 1
roundabout 1
way 1
amongst 1
the 1
islands 1
and 1
search 1
him 1
and 1
take 1
his 1
chalk 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
give 1
it 1
back 1
to 1
him 1
till 1

so 1
he 1
can 1
find 1
it 1
again 1
It 1
s 1
the 1
way 1
they 1
all 1

So 1
I 1
said 1
I 1
would 1
and 1
left 1
and 1
Jim 1
was 1
to 1
hide 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
when 1
he 1
see 1
the 1
doctor 1
coming 1
till 1
he 1
was 1
gone 1
again 1
CHAPTER 1
XLI 1
THE 1
doctor 1
was 1
an 1
old 1
man 1
a 1
very 1
nice 1
kind 1
looking 1
old 1
man 1
when 1
I 1
got 1
him 1
up 1
I 1
told 1
him 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
brother 1
was 1
over 1
on 1
Spanish 1
Island 1
hunting 1
yesterday 1
afternoon 1
and 1
camped 1
on 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
a 1
raft 1
we 1
found 1
and 1
about 1
midnight 1
he 1
must 1
a 1
kicked 1
his 1
gun 1
in 1
his 1
dreams 1
for 1
it 1
went 1
off 1
and 1
shot 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
leg 1
and 1
we 1
wanted 1
him 1
to 1
go 1
over 1
there 1
and 1
fix 1
it 1
and 1
not 1
say 1
nothing 1
about 1
it 1
nor 1
let 1
anybody 1
know 1
because 1
we 1
wanted 1
to 1
come 1
home 1
this 1
evening 1
and 1
surprise 1
the 1
folks 1
Who 1
is 1
your 1
folks 1
he 1
says 1
The 1
Phelpses 1
down 1
yonder 1
Oh 1
he 1
says 1
And 1
after 1
a 1
minute 1
he 1
says 1
How 1
d 1
you 1
say 1
he 1
got 1
shot 1
He 1
had 1
a 1
dream 1
I 1
says 1
and 1
it 1
shot 1
him 1
Singular 1
dream 1
he 1
says 1
So 1
he 1
lit 1
up 1
his 1
lantern 1
and 1
got 1
his 1
saddle 1
bags 1
and 1
we 1
started 1
But 1
when 1
he 1
sees 1
the 1
canoe 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
like 1
the 1
look 1
of 1
her 1
said 1
she 1
was 1
big 1
enough 1
for 1
one 1
but 1
didn 1
t 1
look 1
pretty 1
safe 1
for 1
two 1
I 1
says 1
Oh 1
you 1
needn 1
t 1
be 1
afeard 1
sir 1
she 1
carried 1
the 1
three 1
of 1
us 1
easy 1
enough 1
What 1
three 1
Why 1
me 1
and 1
Sid 1
and 3
the 1
guns 1
that 1
s 1
what 1
I 1
mean 1
Oh 1
he 1
says 1
But 1
he 1
put 1
his 1
foot 1
on 1
the 1
gunnel 1
and 1
rocked 1
her 1
and 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
reckoned 1
he 1
d 1
look 1
around 1
for 1
a 1
bigger 1
one 1
But 1
they 1
was 1
all 1
locked 1
and 1
chained 1
so 1
he 1
took 1
my 1
canoe 1
and 1
said 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
wait 1
till 1
he 1
come 1
back 1
or 1
I 1
could 1
hunt 1
around 1
further 1
or 1
maybe 1
I 1
better 1
go 1
down 1
home 1
and 1
get 1
them 1
ready 1
for 1
the 1
surprise 1
if 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
But 1
I 1
said 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
so 1
I 1
told 1
him 1
just 1
how 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
raft 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
started 1
I 1
struck 1
an 1
idea 1
pretty 1
soon 1
I 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
spos 1
n 1
he 1
can 1
t 1
fix 1
that 1
leg 1
just 1
in 1
three 1
shakes 1
of 1
a 1
sheep 1
s 1
tail 1
as 1
the 1
saying 1
is 1
spos 1
n 1
it 1
takes 1
him 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
days 1
What 1
are 1
we 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
lay 1
around 1
there 1
till 1
he 1
lets 1
the 1
cat 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bag 1
No 1
sir 1
I 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
ll 1
do 1
I 1
ll 1
wait 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
comes 1
back 1
if 1
he 1
says 1
he 1
s 1
got 1
to 1
go 1
any 1
more 1
I 1
ll 1
get 1
down 1
there 1
too 1
if 1
I 1
swim 1
and 1
we 1
ll 1
take 1
and 1
tie 1
him 1
and 1
keep 1
him 1
and 1
shove 1
out 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
when 1
Tom 1
s 1
done 1
with 1
him 1
we 1
ll 1
give 1
him 1
what 1
it 1
s 1
worth 1
or 1
all 1
we 1
got 1
and 1
then 1
let 1
him 1
get 1
ashore 1
So 1
then 1
I 1
crept 1
into 1
a 1
lumber 1
pile 1
to 1
get 1
some 1
sleep 1
and 1
next 1
time 1
I 1
waked 1
up 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
away 1
up 1
over 1
my 1
head 1
I 1
shot 1
out 1
and 1
went 1
for 1
the 1
doctor 1
s 1
house 1
but 1
they 1
told 1
me 1
he 1
d 1
gone 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
some 1
time 1
or 1
other 1
and 1
warn 1
t 1
back 1
yet 1
Well 1
thinks 1
I 1
that 1
looks 1
powerful 1
bad 1
for 1
Tom 1
and 1
I 1
ll 1
dig 1
out 1
for 1
the 1
island 1
right 1
off 1
So 1
away 1
I 1
shoved 1
and 1
turned 1
the 1
corner 1
and 1
nearly 1
rammed 1
my 1
head 1
into 1
Uncle 1
Silas 1
s 1
stomach 1
He 1
says 1
Why 1
Tom 1
Where 1
you 1
been 1
all 1
this 1
time 1
you 1
rascal 1
I 1
hain 1
t 1
been 1
nowheres 1
I 1
says 1
only 1
just 1
hunting 1
for 1
the 1
runaway 1
nigger 1
me 1
and 1
Sid 1
Why 1
where 1
ever 1
did 1
you 1
go 1
he 1
says 1
Your 1
aunt 1
s 1
been 1
mighty 1
uneasy 1
She 1
needn 1
t 1
I 1
says 1
because 1
we 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
We 1
followed 1
the 1
men 1
and 1
the 1
dogs 1
but 1
they 1
outrun 1
us 1
and 1
we 1
lost 1
them 1
but 1
we 1
thought 1
we 1
heard 1
them 1
on 1
the 1
water 1
so 1
we 1
got 1
a 1
canoe 1
and 1
took 1
out 1
after 1
them 1
and 1
crossed 1
over 1
but 1
couldn 1
t 1
find 1
nothing 1
of 1
them 1
so 1
we 1
cruised 1
along 1
up 1
shore 1
till 1
we 1
got 1
kind 1
of 1
tired 1
and 1
beat 1
out 1
and 1
tied 1
up 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
sleep 1
and 1
never 1
waked 1
up 1
till 1
about 1
an 1
hour 1
ago 1
then 1
we 1
paddled 1
over 1
here 1
to 1
hear 1
the 1
news 1
and 1
Sid 1
s 1
at 1
the 1
post 1

hear 1
and 1
I 1
m 1
a 1
branching 1
out 1
to 1
get 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
for 1
us 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
re 1

So 1
then 1
we 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
post 1
office 1
to 1
get 1
Sid 1
but 1
just 1
as 1
I 1
suspicioned 1

so 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
he 1
got 1
a 1
letter 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
office 1
and 1
we 1
waited 1
awhile 1
longer 1
but 1
Sid 1
didn 1
t 1
come 1
so 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
said 1

I 1
couldn 1
t 1
get 1

When 1
we 1

glad 1
to 1

I 1

pass 1
I 1

no 1
reasoning 1
faculties 1
no 1
more 1
It 1
looks 1
foolish 1
enough 1
now 1
in 1
the 1
daytime 1
but 1
I 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
there 1
s 1
my 1
two 1
poor 1
boys 1
asleep 1
way 1
up 1
stairs 1
in 1
that 1
lonesome 1
room 1
and 1
I 1
declare 1
to 1

And 1

Because 1
you 1
know 1
when 1
you 1
get 1
scared 1
that 1
way 1
and 1
it 1
keeps 1
running 1
on 1
and 1
getting 1
worse 1
and 1
worse 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
your 1
wits 1
gets 1
to 1
addling 1
and 1
you 1
get 1
to 1
doing 1
all 1
sorts 1
o 1
wild 1
things 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
you 1
think 1
to 1
yourself 1
spos 1
n 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
boy 1
and 1
was 1
away 1
up 1
there 1
and 1
the 1
door 1
ain 1
t 1
locked 1
and 1
you 1
She 1
stopped 1
looking 1
kind 1
of 1
wondering 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
turned 1
her 1
head 1
around 1
slow 1
and 1
when 1
her 1
eye 1
lit 1
on 1
me 1
I 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
walk 1
Says 1
I 1
to 1
myself 1
I 1
can 1
explain 1
better 1
how 1
we 1
come 1
to 1
not 1
be 1
in 1
that 1
room 1
this 1
morning 1
if 1
I 1
go 1
out 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
study 1
over 1
it 1
a 1
little 1
So 1
I 1
done 1
it 1
But 1
I 1
dasn 1
t 1
go 1
fur 1
or 1
she 1
d 1
a 1
sent 1
for 1
me 1
And 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
late 1
in 1
the 1
day 1
the 1
people 1
all 1
went 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
come 1
in 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
the 1
noise 1
and 1
shooting 1
waked 1
up 1
me 1
and 1
Sid 1
and 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
locked 1
and 1
we 1
wanted 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
fun 1
so 1
we 1
went 1
down 1
the 1
lightning 1
rod 1
and 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
got 1
hurt 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
we 1
didn 1
t 1
never 1
want 1
to 1
try 1
that 1
no 1
more 1
And 1
then 1
I 1
went 1
on 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
all 1
what 1
I 1
told 1
Uncle 1
Silas 1
before 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
said 1
she 1
d 1
forgive 1
us 1
and 1
maybe 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
enough 1
anyway 1
and 1
about 1
what 1
a 1
body 1
might 1
expect 1
of 1
boys 1
for 1
all 1
boys 1
was 1
a 1
pretty 1
harum 1
scarum 1
lot 1
as 1
fur 1
as 1
she 1
could 1
see 1
and 1
so 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
no 1
harm 1
hadn 1
t 1
come 1
of 1
it 1
she 1
judged 1
she 1
better 1
put 1
in 1
her 1
time 1
being 1
grateful 1
we 1
was 1
alive 1
and 1
well 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
us 1
still 1
stead 1
of 1
fretting 1
over 1
what 1
was 1
past 1
and 1
done 1
So 1
then 1
she 1
kissed 1
me 1
and 1
patted 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
head 1
and 1
dropped 1
into 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
brown 1
study 1
and 1
pretty 1
soon 1
jumps 1
up 1
and 1
says 1
Why 1
lawsamercy 1
it 1
s 1
most 1
night 1
and 1
Sid 1
not 1
come 1
yet 1
What 1
has 1
become 1
of 1
that 1
boy 1
I 1
see 1
my 1
chance 1
so 1
I 1
skips 1
up 1
and 1
says 1
I 1
ll 1
run 1
right 1
up 1
to 1
town 1
and 1
get 1
him 1
I 1
says 1
No 1
you 1
won 1
t 1
she 1
says 1
You 1
ll 1
stay 1
right 1
wher 1
you 1
are 1
one 1
s 1
enough 1
to 1
be 1
lost 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
If 1
he 1
ain 1
t 1
here 1
to 1
supper 1
your 1
uncle 1
ll 1
go 1
Well 1
he 1
warn 1
t 1
there 1
to 1
supper 1
so 1
right 1
after 1
supper 1
uncle 1
went 1
He 1
come 1
back 1
about 1
ten 1
a 1
little 1
bit 1
uneasy 1
hadn 1
t 1
run 1
across 1
Tom 1
s 1
track 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
uneasy 1
but 1
Uncle 1
Silas 1
he 1
said 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
occasion 1
to 1
be 1
boys 1
will 1
be 1
boys 1
he 1
said 1
and 1
you 1
ll 1
see 1
this 1
one 1
turn 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
all 1
sound 1
and 1
right 1
So 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
satisfied 1
But 1
she 1
said 1
she 1
d 1
set 1
up 1
for 1
him 1
a 1
while 1
anyway 1
and 1
keep 1
a 1
light 1
burning 1
so 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
it 1
And 1
then 1
when 1
I 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
bed 1
she 1
come 1
up 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
fetched 1
her 1
candle 1
and 1
tucked 1
me 1
in 1
and 1
mothered 1
me 1
so 1
good 1
I 1
felt 1
mean 1
and 1
like 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
look 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
and 1
she 1
set 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
bed 1
and 1
talked 1
with 1
me 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
and 1
said 1
what 1
a 1
splendid 1
boy 1
Sid 1
was 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
want 1
to 1
ever 1
stop 1
talking 1
about 1
him 1
and 1
kept 1
asking 1
me 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
if 1
I 1
reckoned 1
he 1
could 1
a 1
got 1
lost 1
or 1
hurt 1
or 1
maybe 1
drownded 1
and 1
might 1
be 1
laying 1
at 1
this 1
minute 1
somewheres 1
suffering 1
or 1
dead 1
and 1
she 1
not 1
by 1
him 1
to 1
help 1
him 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
tears 1
would 1
drip 1
down 1
silent 1
and 1
I 1
would 1
tell 1
her 1
that 1
Sid 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
would 1
be 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
sure 1
and 1
she 1
would 1
squeeze 1
my 1
hand 1
or 1
maybe 1
kiss 1
me 1
and 1
tell 1
me 1
to 1
say 1
it 1
again 1
and 1
keep 1
on 1
saying 1
it 1
because 1
it 1
done 1
her 1
good 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
in 1
so 1
much 1
trouble 1
And 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
going 1
away 1
she 1
looked 1
down 1
in 1
my 1
eyes 1
so 1
steady 1
and 1
gentle 1
and 1
says 1
The 1
door 1
ain 1
t 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
locked 1
Tom 1
and 1
there 1
s 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
the 1
rod 1
but 1
you 1
ll 1
be 1
good 1
won 1
t 1
you 1
And 1
you 1
won 1
t 1
go 1
For 1
my 1
sake 1
Laws 1
knows 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
bad 1
enough 1
to 1
see 1
about 1
Tom 1
and 1
was 1
all 1
intending 1
to 1
go 1
but 1
after 1
that 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
a 1
went 1
not 1
for 1
kingdoms 1
But 1
she 1
was 1
on 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
Tom 1
was 1
on 1
my 1
mind 1
so 1
I 1
slept 1
very 1
restless 1
And 1
twice 1
I 1
went 1
down 1
the 1
rod 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
and 1
slipped 1
around 1
front 1
and 1
see 1
her 1
setting 1
there 1
by 1
her 1
candle 1
in 1
the 1
window 1
with 1
her 1
eyes 1
towards 1
the 1
road 1
and 1
the 1
tears 1
in 1
them 1
and 1
I 1
wished 1
I 1
could 1
do 1
something 1
for 1
her 1
but 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
only 1
to 1
swear 1
that 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
never 1
do 1
nothing 1
to 1
grieve 1
her 1
any 1
more 1
And 1
the 1
third 1
time 1
I 1
waked 1
up 1
at 1
dawn 1
and 1
slid 1
down 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
there 1
yet 1
and 1
her 1
candle 1
was 1
most 1
out 1
and 1
her 1
old 1
gray 1
head 1
was 1
resting 1
on 1
her 1
hand 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
asleep 1
CHAPTER 1
XLII 1
THE 1
old 1
man 1
was 1
uptown 1
again 1
before 1
breakfast 1
but 1
couldn 1
t 1
get 1
no 1
track 1
of 1
Tom 1
and 1
both 1
of 1
them 1
set 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
thinking 1
and 1
not 1
saying 1
nothing 1
and 1
looking 1
mournful 1
and 1
their 1
coffee 1
getting 1
cold 1
and 1
not 1
eating 1
anything 1
And 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
says 1
Did 1

the 1
post 1
office 1
No 1
you 1
didn 1
t 1
give 1
me 1
no 1
letter 1
Well 1
I 1
must 1
a 1
forgot 1
it 1
So 1
he 1
rummaged 1
his 1
pockets 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
off 1
somewheres 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
laid 1
it 1
down 1
and 1
fetched 1
it 1
and 1
give 1
it 1
to 1
her 1
She 1
says 1
Why 1
it 1
s 1
from 1
St 1
Petersburg 1
it 1
s 1
from 1
Sis 1
I 1
allowed 1
another 1
walk 1
would 1
do 1
me 1
good 1
but 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
stir 1
But 1
before 1
she 1
could 1
break 1
it 1
open 1
she 1
dropped 1
it 1
and 1
run 1
for 1
she 1
see 1
something 1
And 1
so 1
did 1
I 1
It 1
was 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
on 1
a 1
mattress 1
and 1
that 1
old 1
doctor 1
and 1
Jim 1
in 1
her 1
calico 1
dress 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
tied 1
behind 1
him 1
and 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
people 1
I 1
hid 1
the 1
letter 1
behind 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
that 1
come 1
handy 1
and 1
rushed 1
She 1
flung 1
herself 1
at 1
Tom 1
crying 1
and 1
says 1
Oh 1
he 1
s 1
dead 1
he 1
s 1
dead 1
I 1
know 1
he 1
s 1
dead 1
And 1
Tom 1
he 1
turned 1
his 1
head 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
muttered 1
something 1
or 1
other 1
which 1
showed 1
he 1
warn 1
t 1
in 1
his 1
right 1
mind 1
then 1
she 1
flung 1
up 1
her 1
hands 1
and 1
says 1
He 1
s 1
alive 1
thank 1
God 1
And 1
that 1
s 1
enough 1
and 1
she 1
snatched 1
a 1
kiss 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
flew 1
for 1
the 1
house 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
bed 1
ready 1
and 1
scattering 1
orders 1
right 1
and 1
left 1
at 1
the 1
niggers 1
and 1
everybody 1
else 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
her 1
tongue 1
could 1
go 1
every 1
jump 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
I 1
followed 1
the 1
men 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
they 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
Jim 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
doctor 1
and 1
Uncle 1
Silas 1
followed 1
after 1
Tom 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
The 1
men 1
was 1
very 1
huffy 1
and 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
wanted 1
to 1
hang 1
Jim 1
for 1
an 1
example 1
to 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
niggers 1
around 1
there 1
so 1
they 1
wouldn 1
t 1
be 1
trying 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
like 1
Jim 1
done 1
and 1
making 1
such 1
a 1
raft 1
of 1
trouble 1
and 1
keeping 1
a 1
whole 1
family 1
scared 1
most 1
to 1
death 1
for 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
But 1
the 1
others 1
said 1
don 1
t 1
do 1
it 2
wouldn 1
t 1
answer 1
at 1
all 1
he 1
ain 1
t 1
our 1
nigger 1
and 1
his 1
owner 1
would 1
turn 1
up 1
and 1
make 1
us 1
pay 1
for 1
him 1
sure 1
So 1
that 1
cooled 1
them 1
down 1
a 1
little 1
because 1
the 1
people 1
that 1
s 1
always 1
the 1
most 1
anxious 1
for 1
to 1
hang 1
a 1
nigger 1
that 1
hain 1
t 1
done 1
just 1
right 1
is 1
always 1
the 1
very 1
ones 1
that 1
ain 1
t 1
the 1
most 1
anxious 1
to 1
pay 1
for 1
him 1
when 1
they 1
ve 1
got 1
their 1
satisfaction 1
out 1
of 1
him 1
They 1
cussed 1
Jim 1
considerble 1
though 1
and 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
cuff 1
or 1
two 1
side 1
the 1
head 1
once 1
in 1
a 1
while 1
but 1
Jim 1
never 1
said 1
nothing 1
and 1
he 1
never 1
let 1
on 1
to 1
know 1
me 1
and 1
they 1
took 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
cabin 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
own 1
clothes 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
chained 1
him 1
again 1
and 1
not 1
to 1
no 1
bed 1
leg 1
this 1
time 1
but 1
to 1
a 1
big 1
staple 1
drove 1
into 1
the 1
bottom 1
log 1
and 1
chained 1
his 1
hands 1
too 1
and 1
both 1
legs 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
warn 1
t 1
to 1
have 1
nothing 1
but 1
bread 1
and 1
water 1
to 1
eat 1
after 1
this 1
till 1
his 1
owner 1
come 1
or 1
he 1
was 1
sold 1
at 1
auction 1
because 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
come 1
in 1
a 1
certain 1
length 1
of 1
time 1
and 1
filled 1
up 1
our 1
hole 1
and 1
said 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
farmers 1
with 1
guns 1
must 1
stand 1
watch 1
around 1
about 1
the 1
cabin 1
every 1
night 1
and 1
a 1
bulldog 1
tied 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
in 1
the 1
daytime 1
and 1
about 1
this 1
time 1
they 1
was 1
through 1
with 1
the 1
job 1
and 1
was 1
tapering 1
off 1
with 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
generl 1
good 1
bye 1
cussing 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
old 1
doctor 1
comes 1
and 1
takes 1
a 1
look 1
and 1
says 1
Don 1
t 1
be 1
no 1
rougher 1
on 1
him 1
than 1
you 1
re 1
obleeged 1
to 1
because 1
he 1
ain 1
t 1
a 1
bad 1
nigger 1
When 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
where 1
I 1
found 1
the 1
boy 1
I 1
see 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
cut 1
the 1
bullet 1
out 1
without 1
some 1
help 1
and 1
he 1
warn 1
t 1
in 1
no 1
condition 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
leave 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
get 1
help 1
and 1
he 1
got 1
a 1
little 1
worse 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
worse 1
and 1
after 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
he 1
went 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
wouldn 1
t 1
let 1
me 1
come 1
a 1
nigh 1
him 1
any 1
more 1
and 1
said 1
if 1
I 1
chalked 1
his 1
raft 1
he 1
d 1
kill 1
me 1
and 1
no 1
end 1
of 1
wild 1
foolishness 1
like 1
that 1
and 1
I 1
see 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
do 1
anything 1
at 1
all 1
with 1
him 1
so 1
I 1
says 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
have 1
help 1
somehow 1
and 1
the 1
minute 1
I 1
says 1
it 1
out 1
crawls 1
this 1
nigger 1
from 1
somewheres 1
and 1
says 1
he 1
ll 1
help 1
and 1
he 1
done 1
it 1
too 1
and 1
done 1
it 1
very 1
well 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
judged 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
runaway 1
nigger 1
and 1
there 1
I 1
was 1
and 1
there 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
stick 1
right 1
straight 1
along 1
all 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
all 1
night 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
fix 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
patients 1
with 1
the 1
chills 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
I 1
d 1
of 1
liked 1
to 1
run 1
up 1
to 1
town 1
and 1
see 1
them 1
but 1
I 1
dasn 1
t 1
because 1
the 1
nigger 1
might 1
get 1
away 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
d 1
be 1
to 1
blame 1
and 1
yet 1
never 1
a 1
skiff 1
come 1
close 1
enough 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
hail 1
So 1
there 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
stick 1
plumb 1
until 1
daylight 1
this 1
morning 1
and 1
I 1
never 1
see 1
a 1
nigger 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
better 1
nuss 1
or 1
faithfuller 1
and 1
yet 1
he 1
was 1
risking 1
his 1
freedom 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
and 1
was 1
all 1
tired 1
out 1
too 1
and 1
I 1
see 1
plain 1
enough 1
he 1
d 1
been 1
worked 1
main 1
hard 1
lately 1
I 1
liked 1
the 1
nigger 1
for 1
that 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
gentlemen 1
a 1
nigger 1
like 1
that 1
is 1
worth 1
a 1
thousand 1
dollars 1
and 1
kind 1
treatment 1
too 1
I 1
had 1
everything 1
I 1
needed 1
and 1
the 1
boy 1
was 1
doing 1
as 1
well 1
there 1
as 1
he 1
would 1
a 1
done 1
at 1
home 1
better 1
maybe 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
quiet 1
but 1
there 1
I 1
was 1
with 1
both 1
of 1
m 1
on 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
there 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
stick 1
till 1
about 1
dawn 1
this 1
morning 1
then 1
some 1
men 1
in 1
a 1
skiff 1
come 1
by 1
and 1
as 1
good 1
luck 1
would 1
have 1
it 1
the 1
nigger 1
was 1
setting 1
by 1
the 1
pallet 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
propped 1
on 1
his 1
knees 1
sound 1
asleep 1
so 1
I 1
motioned 1
them 1
in 1
quiet 1
and 1
they 1
slipped 1
up 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
grabbed 1
him 1
and 1
tied 1
him 1
before 1
he 1
knowed 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
about 1
and 1
we 1
never 1
had 1
no 1
trouble 1
And 1
the 1
boy 1
being 1
in 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
flighty 1
sleep 1
too 1
we 1
muffled 1
the 1
oars 1
and 1
hitched 1
the 1
raft 1
on 1
and 1
towed 1
her 1
over 1
very 1
nice 1
and 1
quiet 1
and 1
the 1
nigger 1
never 1
made 1
the 1
least 1
row 1
nor 1
said 1
a 1
word 1
from 1
the 1
start 1
He 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
bad 1
nigger 1
gentlemen 1
that 1
s 1
what 1
I 1
think 1
about 1
him 1
Somebody 1
says 1
Well 1
it 1
sounds 1
very 1
good 1
doctor 1
I 1
m 1
obleeged 1
to 1
say 1
Then 1
the 1
others 1
softened 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
mighty 1
thankful 1
to 1
that 1
old 1
doctor 1
for 1
doing 1
Jim 1
that 1
good 1
turn 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
glad 1
it 1
was 1
according 1
to 1
my 1
judgment 1
of 1
him 1
too 1
because 1
I 1
thought 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
heart 1
in 1
him 1
and 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
man 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
I 1
see 1
him 1
Then 1
they 1
all 1
agreed 1
that 1
Jim 1
had 1
acted 1
very 1
well 1
and 1
was 1
deserving 1
to 1
have 1
some 1
notice 1
took 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
reward 1
So 1
every 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
promised 1
right 1
out 1
and 1
hearty 1
that 1
they 1
wouldn 1
t 1
cuss 1
him 1
no 1
more 1
Then 1
they 1
come 1
out 1
and 1
locked 1
him 1
up 1
I 1
hoped 1
they 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
say 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
of 1
the 1
chains 1
took 1
off 1
because 1
they 1
was 1
rotten 1
heavy 1
or 1
could 1
have 1
meat 1
and 1
greens 1
with 1
his 1
bread 1
and 1
water 1
but 1
they 1
didn 1
t 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
I 1
reckoned 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
best 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
mix 1
in 1
but 1
I 1
judged 1
I 1
d 1
get 1
the 1
doctor 1
s 1
yarn 1
to 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
somehow 1
or 1
other 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
I 1
d 1
got 1
through 1
the 1
breakers 1
that 1
was 1
laying 1
just 1
ahead 1
of 1
me 1
explanations 1
I 1
mean 1
of 1
how 1
I 1
forgot 1
to 1
mention 1
about 1
Sid 1
being 1
shot 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
telling 1
how 1
him 1
and 1
me 1
put 1
in 1
that 1
dratted 1
night 1
paddling 1
around 1
hunting 1
the 1
runaway 1
nigger 1
But 1
I 1
had 1
plenty 1
time 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
she 1
stuck 1
to 1
the 1
sick 1
room 1
all 1
day 1
and 1
all 1
night 1
and 1
every 1
time 1
I 1
see 1
Uncle 1
Silas 1
mooning 1
around 1
I 1
dodged 1
him 1
Next 1
morning 1
I 1
heard 1
Tom 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
better 1
and 1
they 1
said 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
was 1
gone 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
nap 1
So 1
I 1
slips 1
to 1
the 1
sick 1
room 1
and 1
if 1
I 1
found 1
him 1
awake 1
I 1
reckoned 1
we 1
could 1
put 1
up 1
a 1
yarn 1
for 1
the 1
family 1
that 1
would 1
wash 1
But 1
he 1
was 1
sleeping 1
and 1
sleeping 1
very 1
peaceful 1
too 1
and 1
pale 1
not 1
fire 1
faced 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
was 1
when 1
he 1
come 1
So 1
I 1
set 1
down 1
and 1
laid 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
wake 1
In 1
about 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
comes 1
gliding 1
in 1
and 1
there 1
I 1
was 1
up 1
a 1
stump 1
again 1
She 1
motioned 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
still 1
and 1
set 1
down 1
by 1
me 1
and 1
begun 1
to 1
whisper 1
and 1
said 1
we 1
could 1
all 1
be 1
joyful 1
now 1
because 1
all 1
the 1
symptoms 1
was 1
first 1
rate 1
and 1
he 1
d 1
been 1
sleeping 1
like 1
that 1
for 1
ever 1
so 1
long 1
and 1
looking 1
better 1
and 1
peacefuller 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
ten 1
to 1
one 1
he 1
d 1
wake 1
up 1
in 1
his 1
right 1
mind 1
So 1
we 1
set 1
there 1
watching 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
he 1
stirs 1
a 1
bit 1
and 1
opened 1
his 1
eyes 1
very 1
natural 1
and 1
takes 1
a 1
look 1
and 1
says 1
Hello 1
why 1
I 1
m 1
at 1
home 1
How 1
s 1
that 1
Where 1
s 1
the 1
raft 1
It 1
s 1
all 1
right 1
I 1
says 1
And 1
Jim 1
The 1
same 1
I 1
says 1
but 1
couldn 1
t 1
say 1
it 1
pretty 1
brash 1
But 1
he 1
never 1
noticed 1
but 1
says 1
Good 1
Splendid 1
Now 1
we 1
re 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
safe 1
Did 1
you 1
tell 1
Aunty 1
I 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
say 1
yes 1
but 1
she 1
chipped 1
in 1
and 1
says 1
About 1
what 1
Sid 1
Why 1
about 1
the 1
way 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
was 1
done 1
What 1
whole 1
thing 1
Why 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
There 1
ain 1
t 1
but 1
one 1
how 1

set 1

runaway 1
nigger 1
free 1

and 1

Good 1

Set 1

What 1

child 1

about 1

head 1

No 1

t 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
head 1

all 1
what 1
I 1
m 1
talking 1
about 1
We 1
did 1
set 1
him 1
free 1
me 1
and 1
Tom 1
We 1
laid 1
out 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
and 1

it 1
And 1
we 1
done 1
it 1
elegant 1
too 1
He 1

a 1
start 1
and 1
she 1
never 1
checked 1
him 1
up 1
just 1
set 1
and 1

and 1
stared 1
and 1
let 1
him 1
clip 1
along 1
and 1
I 1
see 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
use 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
put 1
in 1
Why 1
Aunty 1
it 1
cost 1
us 1
a 1
power 1
of 1
work 1
weeks 1
of 1
it 1
hours 1
and 1
hours 1
every 1
night 1
whilst 1
you 1
was 1
all 1
asleep 1
And 1
we 1
had 1
to 1
steal 1
candles 1
and 1
the 1
sheet 1
and 1
the 1
shirt 1
and 1
your 1
dress 1
and 1
spoons 1
and 1
tin 1
plates 1
and 1
case 1
knives 1
and 1

warming 1
pan 1
and 1
the 1
grindstone 1
and 1
flour 1
and 1
just 1
no 1
end 1
of 1
things 1
and 1
you 1
can 1
t 1
think 1
what 1
work 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
saws 1
and 1
pens 1
and 1
inscriptions 1
and 1
one 1
thing 1
or 1
another 1
and 1
you 1
can 1
t 1
think 1
half 1
the 1
fun 1
it 1
was 1
And 1
we 1
had 1
to 1
make 1
up 1
the 1
pictures 1
of 1
coffins 1
and 1
things 1
and 1
nonnamous 1
letters 1
from 1
the 1
robbers 1
and 1
get 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
lightning 1
rod 1
and 1
dig 1
the 1
hole 1
into 1
the 1
cabin 1
and 1
made 1
the 1
rope 1
ladder 1
and 1
send 1
it 1
in 1
cooked 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
pie 1
and 1
send 1
in 1
spoons 1
and 1
things 1
to 1
work 1
with 1
in 1
your 1
apron 1
pocket 1
Mercy 1
sakes 1
and 1
load 1
up 1
the 1
cabin 1
with 1
rats 1
and 1
snakes 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
for 1
company 1
for 1
Jim 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
kept 1
Tom 1
here 1
so 1
long 1
with 1
the 1
butter 1
in 1
his 1
hat 1
that 1
you 1
come 1
near 1
spiling 1
the 1
whole 1
business 1
because 1
the 1
men 1
come 1
before 1
we 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
cabin 1
and 1
we 1
had 1
to 1
rush 1
and 1
they 1

and 1

us 1
and 1
I 1

the 1
most 1
noise 1
and 1
we 1
got 1
our 1
canoe 1
and 1
made 1
for 1
the 1
raft 1
and 1
was 1
all 1
safe 1
and 1
Jim 1
was 1
a 1
free 1
man 1
and 1
we 1

it 1
all 1
by 1
ourselves 1
and 1

with 1
his 1
eye 1
hot 1
and 1
his 1
nostrils 1
opening 1
and 1
shutting 1
like 1

sings 1
out 1
to 1
me 1
They 1
hain 1
t 1
no 1
right 1
to 1
shut 1
him 1

SHOVE 1
and 1

Turn 1

as 1
free 1
as 1

cretur 1
that 1
walks 1

earth 1
What 1
does 1
the 1
child 1
mean 1
I 1
mean 1

word 1
I 1
say 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
and 1
if 1
somebody 1
don 1
t 1
go 1
I 1
ll 1
go 1
I 1
ve 1
knowed 1
him 1
all 1
his 1
life 1
and 1
so 1
has 1
Tom 1
there 1
Old 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
died 1
two 1
months 1
ago 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
ashamed 1
she 1
ever 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
sell 1
him 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
said 1
so 1
and 1
she 1
set 1
him 1
free 1
in 1
her 1
will 1
Then 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
did 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
set 1
him 1
free 1
for 1
seeing 1
he 1
was 1
already 1
free 1
Well 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
question 1
I 1
must 1
say 1
and 1
just 1
like 1
women 1
Why 1
I 1
wanted 1
the 1
adventure 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
I 1
d 1
a 1
waded 1
neck 1
deep 1
in 1
blood 1
to 1
goodness 1
alive 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
If 1
she 1
warn 1
t 1
standing 1
right 1
there 1
just 1
inside 1
the 1
door 1
looking 1
as 1
sweet 1
and 1
contented 1
as 1
an 1
angel 1
half 1
full 1
of 1
pie 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
may 1
never 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
jumped 1
for 1
her 1
and 1
most 1
hugged 1
the 1
head 1
off 1
of 1
her 1
and 1
cried 1
over 1
her 1
and 1
I 1
found 1
a 1
good 1
enough 1
place 1
for 1
me 1
under 1
the 1
bed 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
getting 1
pretty 1
sultry 1
for 1
us 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
And 1
I 1
peeped 1
out 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
Tom 1
s 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
shook 1
herself 1
loose 1
and 1
stood 1
there 1
looking 1
across 1
at 1
Tom 1
over 1
her 1
spectacles 1
kind 1
of 1
grinding 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
earth 1
you 1
know 1
And 1
then 1
she 1
says 1
Yes 1
you 1
better 1
turn 1
y 1
r 1
head 1
away 1
I 1
would 1
if 1
I 1
was 1
you 1
Tom 1
Oh 1
deary 1
me 1
says 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
Is 1
he 1
changed 1
so 1
Why 1
that 1
ain 1
t 1
Tom 1
it 1
s 1
Sid 1
Tom 1
s 1
Tom 1
s 1
why 1
where 1
is 1
Tom 1
He 1
was 1
here 1
a 1
minute 1
ago 1
You 1
mean 1
where 1
s 1
Huck 1
Finn 1
that 1
s 1
what 1
you 1
mean 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
hain 1
t 1
raised 1
such 1
a 1
scamp 1
as 1
my 1
Tom 1
all 1
these 1
years 1
not 1
to 1
know 1
him 1
when 1
I 1
see 1
him 1
That 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
pretty 1
howdy 1
do 1
Come 1
out 1
from 1
under 1
that 1
bed 1
Huck 1
Finn 1
So 1
I 1
done 1
it 1
But 1
not 1
feeling 1
brash 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
she 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
mixed 1
upest 1
looking 1
persons 1
I 1
ever 1
see 1
except 1
one 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
Uncle 1
Silas 1
when 1
he 1
come 1
in 1
and 1
they 1
told 1
it 1
all 1
to 1
him 1
It 1
kind 1
of 1
made 1
him 1
drunk 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
say 1
and 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
nothing 1
at 1
all 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
preached 1
a 1
prayer 1
meeting 1
sermon 1
that 1
night 1
that 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
rattling 1
ruputation 1
because 1
the 1
oldest 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
couldn 1
t 1
a 1
understood 1
it 1
So 1
Tom 1
s 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
she 1
told 1
all 1
about 1
who 1
I 1
was 1
and 1
what 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
up 1
and 1
tell 1
how 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
tight 1
place 1
that 1
when 1
Mrs 1
Phelps 1
took 1
me 1
for 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
she 1
chipped 1
in 1
and 1
says 1
Oh 1
go 1
on 1
and 1
call 1
me 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
I 1
m 1
used 1
to 1
it 1
now 1
and 1
tain 1
t 1
no 1
need 1
to 1
change 1
that 1
when 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
took 1
me 1
for 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
stand 1
it 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
no 1
other 1
way 1
and 1
I 1
knowed 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
mind 1
because 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
nuts 1
for 1
him 1
being 1
a 1
mystery 1
and 1
he 1
d 1
make 1
an 1
adventure 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
be 1
perfectly 1
satisfied 1
And 1
so 1
it 1
turned 1
out 1
and 1
he 1
let 1
on 1
to 1
be 1
Sid 1
and 1
made 1
things 1
as 1
soft 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
for 1
me 1
And 1
his 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
she 1
said 1
Tom 1
was 1
right 1
about 1
old 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
setting 1
Jim 1
free 1
in 1
her 1
will 1
and 1
so 1
sure 1
enough 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
had 1
gone 1
and 1
took 1
all 1
that 1
trouble 1
and 1
bother 1
to 1
set 1
a 1
free 1
nigger 1
free 1
and 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
ever 1
understand 1
before 1
until 1
that 1
minute 1
and 1
that 1
talk 1
how 1
he 1
could 1
help 1
a 1
body 1
set 1
a 1
nigger 1
free 1
with 1
his 1
bringing 1
up 1
Well 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
she 1
said 1
that 1
when 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
wrote 1
to 1
her 1
that 1
Tom 1
and 1
Sid 1
had 1
come 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
safe 1
she 1
says 1
to 1
herself 1
Look 1
at 1
that 1
now 1
I 1
might 1
have 1
expected 1
it 1
letting 1
him 1
go 1
off 1
that 1
way 1
without 1
anybody 1
to 1
watch 1
him 1
So 1
now 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
trapse 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
eleven 1
hundred 1
mile 1
and 1
find 1
out 1
what 1
that 1
creetur 1
s 1
up 1
to 1
this 1
time 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
get 1
any 1
answer 1
out 1
of 1
you 1
about 1
it 1
Why 1
I 1
never 1
heard 1
nothing 1
from 1
you 1
says 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
Well 1
I 1
wonder 1
Why 1
I 1
wrote 1
you 1
twice 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
what 1
you 1
could 1
mean 1
by 1
Sid 1
being 1
here 1
Well 1
I 1
never 1
got 1
em 1
Sis 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
she 1
turns 1
around 1
slow 1
and 1
severe 1
and 1
says 1
You 1
Tom 1
Well 1
what 1
he 1
says 1
kind 1
of 1
pettish 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
what 1
me 1
you 1
impudent 1
thing 1
hand 1
out 1
them 1
letters 1
What 1
letters 1
Them 1
letters 1
I 1
be 1
bound 1
if 1
I 1
have 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
holt 1
of 1
you 1
I 1
ll 1
They 1
re 1
in 1
the 1
trunk 1
There 1
now 1
And 1
they 1
re 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
they 1
was 1
when 1
I 1
got 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
office 1
I 1
hain 1
t 1
looked 1
into 1
them 1
I 1
hain 1
t 1
touched 1
them 1
But 1
I 1
knowed 1
they 1
d 1
make 1
trouble 1
and 1
I 1
thought 1
if 1
you 1
warn 1
t 1
in 1
no 1
hurry 1
I 1
d 1
Well 1
you 1
do 1
need 1
skinning 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
mistake 1
about 1
it 1
And 1
I 1
wrote 1
another 1
one 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
I 1
was 1
coming 1
and 1
I 1
s 1
pose 1
he 1
No 1
it 1
come 1
yesterday 1
I 1
hain 1
t 1
read 1
it 1
yet 1
but 1
it 1
s 1
all 1
right 1
I 1
ve 1
got 1
that 1
one 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
offer 1
to 1
bet 1
two 1
dollars 1
she 1
hadn 1
t 1
but 1
I 1
reckoned 1
maybe 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
as 1
safe 1
to 1
not 1
to 1
So 1
I 1
never 1
said 1
nothing 1
CHAPTER 1
THE 1
LAST 1
THE 1
first 1
time 1
I 1
catched 1
Tom 1
private 1
I 1
asked 1
him 1
what 1
was 1
his 1
idea 1
time 1
of 1
the 1
evasion 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
d 1
planned 1
to 1
do 1
if 1
the 1
evasion 1
worked 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
he 1
managed 1
to 1
set 1
a 1
nigger 1
free 1
that 1
was 1
already 1
free 1
before 1
And 1
he 1
said 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
planned 1
in 1
his 1
head 1
from 1
the 1
start 1
if 1
we 1
got 1
Jim 1
out 1
all 1
safe 1
was 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
run 1
him 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
on 1
the 1
raft 1
and 1
have 1
adventures 1
plumb 1
to 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
then 1
tell 1
him 1
about 1
his 1
being 1
free 1
and 1
take 1
him 1
back 1
up 1
home 1
on 1
a 1
steamboat 1
in 1
style 1
and 1
pay 1
him 1
for 1
his 1
lost 1
time 1
and 1
write 1
word 1
ahead 1
and 1
get 1
out 1
all 1
the 1
niggers 1
around 1
and 1
have 1
them 1
waltz 1
him 1
into 1
town 1
with 1
a 1
torchlight 1
procession 1
and 1
a 1
brass 1
band 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
hero 1
and 1
so 1
would 1
we 1
But 1
I 1
reckoned 1
it 1
was 1
about 1
as 1
well 1
the 1
way 1
it 1
was 1
We 1
had 1
Jim 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
chains 1
in 1
no 1
time 1
and 1
when 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
and 1
Uncle 1
Silas 1
and 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
found 1
out 1
how 1
good 1
he 1
helped 1
the 1
doctor 1
nurse 1
Tom 1
they 1
made 1
a 1
heap 1
of 1
fuss 1
over 1
him 1
and 1
fixed 1
him 1
up 1
prime 1
and 1
give 1
him 1
all 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
a 1
good 1
time 1
and 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
And 1
we 1
had 1
him 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
sick 1
room 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
high 1
talk 1
and 1
Tom 1
give 1
Jim 1
forty 1
dollars 1
for 1
being 1
prisoner 1
for 1
us 1
so 1
patient 1
and 1
doing 1
it 1
up 1
so 1
good 1
and 1
Jim 1
was 1
pleased 1
most 1
to 1

and 1
busted 1
