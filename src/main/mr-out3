TO 1
Mrs 1
Saville 1
England 1
You 1
will 1
rejoice 1
to 1
hear 1
that 1
no 1
disaster 1
has 1
accompanied 1
the 1
commencement 1
of 1
an 1
enterprise 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
regarded 1
with 1
such 1
evil 1
forebodings 1
I 1
arrived 1
here 1
yesterday 1
and 1
my 1
first 1
task 1
is 1
to 1
assure 1
my 1
dear 1
sister 1
of 1
my 1
welfare 1
and 1
increasing 1
confidence 1
in 1
the 1
success 1
of 1
my 1
undertaking 1
I 1
am 1
already 1
far 1
north 1
of 1
London 1
and 1
as 1
I 1
walk 1
in 1
the 1
streets 1
of 1
Petersburgh 1
I 1
feel 1
a 1
cold 1
northern 1
breeze 1
play 1
upon 1
my 1
cheeks 1
which 1
braces 1
my 1
nerves 1
and 1
fills 1
me 1
with 1
delight 1
Do 1
you 1
understand 1
this 1
feeling 1
This 1
breeze 1
which 1
has 1
travelled 1
from 1
the 1
regions 1
towards 1
which 1
I 1
am 1
advancing 1
gives 1
me 1
a 1
foretaste 1
of 1
those 1
icy 1
climes 1
Inspirited 1
by 1
this 1
wind 1
of 1
promise 1
my 1
daydreams 1
become 1
more 1
fervent 1
and 1
vivid 1
I 1
try 1
in 1
vain 1
to 1
be 1
persuaded 1
that 1
the 1
pole 1
is 1
the 1
seat 1
of 1
frost 1
and 1
desolation 1
it 1
ever 1
presents 1
itself 1
to 1
my 1
imagination 1
as 1
the 1
region 1
of 1
beauty 1
and 1
delight 1
There 1
Margaret 1
the 1
sun 1
is 1
forever 1
visible 1
its 1
broad 1
disk 1
just 1
skirting 1
the 1
horizon 1
and 1
diffusing 1
a 1
perpetual 1
splendour 1
There 1
for 1
with 1
your 1
leave 1
my 1
sister 1
I 1
will 1
put 1
some 1
trust 1
in 1
preceding 1
navigators 1
there 1
snow 1
and 1
frost 1
are 1
banished 1
and 1
sailing 1
over 1
a 1
calm 1
sea 1
we 1
may 1
be 1
wafted 1
to 1
a 1
land 1
surpassing 1
in 1
wonders 1
and 1
in 1
beauty 1
every 1
region 1
hitherto 1
discovered 1
on 1
the 1
habitable 1
globe 1
Its 1
productions 1
and 1
features 1
may 1
be 1
without 1
example 1
as 1
the 1
phenomena 1
of 1
the 1
heavenly 1
bodies 1
undoubtedly 1
are 1
in 1
those 1
undiscovered 1
solitudes 1
What 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
expected 1
in 1
a 1
country 1
of 1
eternal 1
light 1
I 1
may 1
there 1
discover 1
the 1
wondrous 1
power 1
which 1
attracts 1
the 1
needle 1
and 1
may 1
regulate 1
a 1
thousand 1
celestial 1
observations 1
that 1
require 1
only 1
this 1
voyage 1
to 1
render 1
their 1
seeming 1
eccentricities 1
consistent 1
forever 1
I 1
shall 1
satiate 1
my 1
ardent 1
curiosity 1
with 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
never 1
before 1
visited 1
and 1
may 1
tread 1
a 1
land 1
never 1
before 1
imprinted 1
by 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
man 1
These 1
are 1
my 1
enticements 1
and 1
they 1
are 1
sufficient 1
to 1
conquer 1
all 1
fear 1
of 1
danger 1
or 1
death 1
and 1
to 1
induce 1
me 1
to 1
commence 1
this 1
laborious 1
voyage 1
with 1
the 1
joy 1
a 1
child 1
feels 1
when 1
he 1
embarks 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
boat 1
with 1
his 1
holiday 1
mates 1
on 1
an 1
expedition 1
of 1
discovery 1
up 1
his 1
native 1
river 1
But 1
supposing 1
all 1
these 1
conjectures 1
to 1
be 1
false 1
you 1
cannot 1
contest 1
the 1
inestimable 1
benefit 1
which 1
I 1
shall 1
confer 1
on 1
all 1
mankind 1
to 1
the 1
last 1
generation 1
by 1
discovering 1
a 1
passage 1
near 1
the 1
pole 1
to 1
those 1
countries 1
to 1
reach 1
which 1
at 1
present 1
so 1
many 1
months 1
are 1
requisite 1
or 1
by 1
ascertaining 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
the 1
magnet 1
which 1
if 1
at 1
all 1
possible 1
can 1
only 1
be 1
effected 1
by 1
an 1
undertaking 1
such 1
as 1
mine 1
These 1
reflections 1
have 1
dispelled 1
the 1
agitation 1
with 1
which 1
I 1
began 1
my 1
letter 1
and 1
I 1
feel 1
my 1
heart 1
glow 1
with 1
an 1
enthusiasm 1
which 1
elevates 1
me 1
to 1
heaven 1
for 1
nothing 1
contributes 1
so 1
much 1
to 1
tranquillize 1
the 1
mind 1
as 1
a 1
steady 1
purpose 1
a 1
point 1
on 1
which 1
the 1
soul 1
may 1
fix 1
its 1
intellectual 1
eye 1
This 1
expedition 1
has 1
been 1
the 1
favourite 1
dream 1
of 1
my 1
early 1
years 1
I 1
have 1
read 1
with 1
ardour 1
the 1
accounts 1
of 1
the 1
various 1
voyages 1
which 1
have 1
been 1
made 1
in 1
the 1
prospect 1
of 1
arriving 1
at 1
the 1
North 1
Pacific 1
Ocean 1
through 1
the 1
seas 1
which 1
surround 1
the 1
pole 1
You 1
may 1
remember 1
that 1
a 1
history 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
voyages 1
made 1
for 1
purposes 1
of 1
discovery 1
composed 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
our 1
good 1
Uncle 1
Thomas 1
library 1
My 1
education 1
was 1
neglected 1
yet 1
I 1
was 1
passionately 1
fond 1
of 1
reading 1
These 1
volumes 1
were 1
my 1
study 1
day 1
and 1
night 1
and 1
my 1
familiarity 1
with 1
them 1
increased 1
that 1
regret 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
felt 1
as 1
a 1
child 1
on 1
learning 1
that 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
dying 1
injunction 1
had 1
forbidden 1
my 1
uncle 1
to 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
embark 1
in 1
a 1
seafaring 1
life 1
These 1
visions 1
faded 1
when 1
I 1
perused 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
those 1
poets 1
whose 1
effusions 1
entranced 1
my 1
soul 1
and 1
lifted 1
it 1
to 1
heaven 1
I 1
also 1
became 1
a 1
poet 1
and 1
for 1
one 1
year 1
lived 1
in 1
a 1
paradise 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
creation 1
I 1
imagined 1
that 1
I 1
also 1
might 1
obtain 1
a 1
niche 1
in 1
the 1
temple 1
where 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
Homer 1
and 1
Shakespeare 1
are 1
consecrated 1
You 1
are 1
well 1
acquainted 1
with 1
my 1
failure 1
and 1
how 1
heavily 1
I 1
bore 1
the 1
disappointment 1
But 1
just 1
at 1
that 1
time 1
I 1
inherited 1
the 1
fortune 1
of 1
my 1
cousin 1
and 1
my 1
thoughts 1
were 1
turned 1
into 1
the 1
channel 1
of 1
their 1
earlier 1
bent 1
Six 1
years 1
have 1
passed 1
since 1
I 1
resolved 1
on 1
my 1
present 1
undertaking 1
I 1
can 1
even 1
now 1
remember 1
the 1
hour 1
from 1
which 1
I 1
dedicated 1
myself 1
to 1
this 1
great 1
enterprise 1
I 1
commenced 1
by 1
inuring 1
my 1
body 1
to 1
hardship 1
I 1
accompanied 1
the 1
whale 1
fishers 1
on 1
several 1
expeditions 1
to 1
the 1
North 1
Sea 1
I 1
voluntarily 1
endured 1
cold 1
famine 1
thirst 1
and 1
want 1
of 1
sleep 1
I 1
often 1
worked 1
harder 1
than 1
the 1
common 1
sailors 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
devoted 1
my 1
nights 1
to 1
the 1
study 1
of 1
mathematics 1
the 1
theory 1
of 1
medicine 1
and 1
those 1
branches 1
of 1
physical 1
science 1
from 1
which 1
a 1
naval 1
adventurer 1
might 1
derive 1
the 1
greatest 1
practical 1
advantage 1
Twice 1
I 1
actually 1
hired 1
myself 1
as 1
an 1
under 1
mate 1
in 1
a 1
Greenland 1
whaler 1
and 1
acquitted 1
myself 1
to 1
admiration 1
I 1
must 1
own 1
I 1
felt 1
a 1
little 1
proud 1
when 1
my 1
captain 1
offered 1
me 1
the 1
second 1
dignity 1
in 1
the 1
vessel 1
and 1
entreated 1
me 1
to 1
remain 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
earnestness 1
so 1
valuable 1
did 1
he 1
consider 1
my 1
services 1
And 1
now 1
dear 1
Margaret 1
do 1
I 1
not 1
deserve 1
to 1
accomplish 1
some 1
great 1
purpose 1
My 1
life 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
passed 1
in 1
ease 1
and 1
luxury 1
but 1
I 1
preferred 1
glory 1
to 1
every 1
enticement 1
that 1
wealth 1
placed 1
in 1
my 1
path 1
Oh 1
that 1
some 1
encouraging 1
voice 1
would 1
answer 1
in 1
the 1
affirmative 1
My 1
courage 1
and 1
my 1
resolution 1
is 1
firm 1
but 1
my 1
hopes 1
fluctuate 1
and 1
my 1
spirits 1
are 1
often 1
depressed 1
I 1
am 1
about 1
to 1
proceed 1
on 1
a 1
long 1
and 1
difficult 1
voyage 1
the 1
emergencies 1
of 1
which 1
will 1
demand 1
all 1
my 1
fortitude 1
I 1
am 1
required 1
not 1
only 1
to 1
raise 1
the 1
spirits 1
of 1
others 1
but 1
sometimes 1
to 1
sustain 1
my 1
own 1
when 1
theirs 1
are 1
failing 1
This 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
favourable 1
period 1
for 1
travelling 1
in 1
Russia 1
They 1
fly 1
quickly 1
over 1
the 1
snow 1
in 1
their 1
sledges 1
the 1
motion 1
is 1
pleasant 1
and 1
in 1
my 1
opinion 1
far 1
more 1
agreeable 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
an 1
English 1
stagecoach 1
The 1
cold 1
is 1
not 1
excessive 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
wrapped 1
in 1
furs 1
a 1
dress 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
already 1
adopted 1
for 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
difference 1
between 1
walking 1
the 1
deck 1
and 1
remaining 1
seated 1
motionless 1
for 1
hours 1
when 1
no 1
exercise 1
prevents 1
the 1
blood 1
from 1
actually 1
freezing 1
in 1
your 1
veins 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
ambition 1
to 1
lose 1
my 1
life 1
on 1
the 1
post 1
road 1
between 1
St 1
Petersburgh 1
and 1
Archangel 1
I 1
shall 1
depart 1
for 1
the 1
latter 1
town 1
in 1
a 1
fortnight 1
or 1
three 1
weeks 1
and 1
my 1
intention 1
is 1
to 1
hire 1
a 1
ship 1
there 1
which 1
can 1
easily 1
be 1
done 1
by 1
paying 1
the 1
insurance 1
for 1
the 1
owner 1
and 1
to 1
engage 1
as 1
many 1
sailors 1
as 1
I 1
think 1
necessary 1
among 1
those 1
who 1
are 1
accustomed 1
to 1
the 1
whale 1
fishing 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
intend 1
to 1
sail 1
until 1
the 1
month 1
of 1
June 1
and 1
when 1
shall 1
I 1
return 1
Ah 1
dear 1
sister 1
how 1
can 1
I 1
answer 1
this 1
question 1
If 1
I 1
succeed 1
many 2
months 1
perhaps 1
years 1
will 1
pass 1
before 1
you 1
and 1
I 1
may 1
meet 1
If 1
I 1
fail 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
me 1
again 1
soon 1
or 1
never 1
Farewell 1
my 1
dear 1
excellent 1
Margaret 1
Heaven 1
shower 1
down 1
blessings 1
on 1
you 1
and 1
save 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
testify 1
my 1
gratitude 1
for 1
all 1
your 1
love 1
and 1
kindness 1
Your 1
affectionate 1

Letter 1

March 1
To 1
Mrs 1
Saville 1
England 1
How 1
slowly 1
the 1
time 1
passes 1
here 1
encompassed 1
as 1
I 1
am 1
by 1
frost 1
and 1
snow 1
Yet 1
a 1
second 1
step 1
is 1
taken 1
towards 1
my 1
enterprise 1
I 1
have 1
hired 1
a 1
vessel 1
and 1
am 1
occupied 1
in 1
collecting 1
my 1
sailors 1
those 1
whom 1
I 1
have 1
already 1
engaged 1
appear 1
to 1
be 1
men 1
on 1
whom 1
I 1
can 1
depend 1
and 1
are 1
certainly 1
possessed 1
of 1
dauntless 1
courage 1
But 1
I 1
have 1
one 1
want 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
never 1
yet 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
satisfy 1
and 1
the 1
absence 1
of 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
which 1
I 1
now 1
feel 1
as 1
a 1
most 1
severe 1
evil 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
friend 1
Margaret 1
when 1
I 1
am 1
glowing 1
with 1
the 1
enthusiasm 1
of 1
success 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
none 1
to 1
participate 1
my 1
joy 1
if 1
I 1
am 1
assailed 1
by 1
disappointment 1
no 1
one 1
will 1
endeavour 1
to 1
sustain 1
me 1
in 1
dejection 1
I 1
shall 1
commit 1
my 1
thoughts 1
to 1
paper 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
but 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
poor 1
medium 1
for 1
the 1
communication 1
of 1
feeling 1
I 1
desire 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
could 1
sympathize 1
with 1
me 1
whose 1
eyes 1
would 1
reply 1
to 1
mine 1
You 1
may 1
deem 1
me 1
romantic 1
my 1
dear 1
sister 1
but 1
I 1
bitterly 1
feel 1
the 1
want 1
of 1
a 1
friend 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
one 1
near 1
me 1
gentle 1
yet 1
courageous 1
possessed 1
of 1
a 1
cultivated 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
of 1
a 1
capacious 1
mind 1
whose 1
tastes 1
are 1
like 1
my 1
own 1
to 1
approve 1
or 1
amend 1
my 1
plans 1
How 1
would 1
such 1
a 1
friend 1
repair 1
the 1
faults 1
of 1
your 1
poor 1
brother 1
I 1
am 1
too 1
ardent 1
in 1
execution 1
and 1
too 1
impatient 1
of 1
difficulties 1
But 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
still 1
greater 1
evil 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
self 1
educated 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
fourteen 1
years 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
I 1
ran 1
wild 1
on 1
a 1
common 1
and 1
read 1
nothing 1
but 1
our 1
Uncle 1
Thomas 1
books 1
of 1
voyages 1
At 1
that 1
age 1
I 1
became 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
celebrated 1
poets 1
of 1
our 1
own 1
country 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
when 1
it 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
to 1
derive 1
its 1
most 1
important 1
benefits 1
from 1
such 1
a 1
conviction 1
that 1
I 1
perceived 1
the 1
necessity 1
of 1
becoming 1
acquainted 1
with 1
more 1
languages 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
my 1
native 1
country 1
Now 1
I 1
am 1
twenty 1
eight 1
and 1
am 1
in 1
reality 1
more 1
illiterate 1
than 1
many 1
schoolboys 1
of 1
fifteen 1
It 1
is 1
true 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
thought 1
more 1
and 1
that 1
my 1
daydreams 1
are 1
more 1
extended 1
and 1
magnificent 1
but 1
they 1
want 1
as 1
the 1
painters 1
call 1
it 1
KEEPING 1
and 1
I 1
greatly 1
need 1
a 1
friend 1
who 1
would 1
have 1
sense 1
enough 1
not 1
to 1
despise 1
me 1
as 1
romantic 1
and 1
affection 1
enough 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
endeavour 1
to 1
regulate 1
my 1
mind 1
Well 1
these 1
are 1
useless 1
complaints 1
I 1
shall 1
certainly 1
find 1
no 1
friend 1
on 1
the 1
wide 1
ocean 1
nor 1
even 1
here 1
in 1
Archangel 1
among 1
merchants 1
and 1
seamen 1
Yet 1
some 1
feelings 1
unallied 1
to 1
the 1
dross 1
of 1
human 1
nature 1
beat 1
even 1
in 1
these 1
rugged 1
bosoms 1
My 1
lieutenant 1
for 1
instance 1
is 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
wonderful 1
courage 1
and 1
enterprise 1
he 1
is 1
madly 1
desirous 1
of 1
glory 1
or 1
rather 1
to 1
word 1
my 1
phrase 1
more 1
characteristically 1
of 1
advancement 1
in 1
his 1
profession 1
He 1
is 1
an 1
Englishman 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
national 1
and 1
professional 1
prejudices 1
unsoftened 1
by 1
cultivation 1
retains 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
noblest 1
endowments 1
of 1
humanity 1
I 1
first 1
became 1
acquainted 1
with 1
him 1
on 1
board 1
a 1
whale 1
vessel 1
finding 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
unemployed 1
in 1
this 1
city 1
I 1
easily 1
engaged 1
him 1
to 1
assist 1
in 1
my 1
enterprise 1
The 1
master 1
is 1
a 1
person 1
of 1
an 1
excellent 1
disposition 1
and 1
is 1
remarkable 1
in 1
the 1
ship 1
for 1
his 1
gentleness 1
and 1
the 1
mildness 1
of 1
his 1
discipline 1
This 1
circumstance 1
added 1
to 1
his 1
well 1
known 1
integrity 1
and 1
dauntless 1
courage 1
made 1
me 1
very 1
desirous 1
to 1
engage 1
him 1
A 1
youth 1
passed 1
in 1
solitude 1
my 1
best 1
years 1
spent 1
under 1
your 1
gentle 1
and 1
feminine 1
fosterage 1
has 1
so 1
refined 1
the 1
groundwork 1
of 1
my 1
character 1
that 1
I 1
cannot 1
overcome 1
an 1
intense 1
distaste 1
to 1
the 1
usual 1
brutality 1
exercised 1
on 1
board 1
ship 1
I 1
have 1
never 1
believed 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
necessary 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
heard 1
of 1
a 1
mariner 1
equally 1
noted 1
for 1
his 1
kindliness 1
of 1
heart 1
and 1
the 1
respect 1
and 1
obedience 1
paid 1
to 1
him 1
by 1
his 1
crew 1
I 1
felt 1
myself 1
peculiarly 1
fortunate 1
in 1
being 1
able 1
to 1
secure 1
his 1
services 1
I 1
heard 1
of 1
him 1
first 1
in 1
rather 1
a 1
romantic 1
manner 1
from 1
a 1
lady 1
who 1
owes 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
happiness 1
of 1
her 1
life 1
This 1
briefly 1
is 1
his 1
story 1
Some 1
years 1
ago 1
he 1
loved 1
a 1
young 1
Russian 1
lady 1
of 1
moderate 1
fortune 1
and 1
having 1
amassed 1
a 1
considerable 1
sum 1
in 1
prize 1
money 1
the 1
father 1
of 1
the 1
girl 1
consented 1
to 1
the 1
match 1
He 1
saw 1
his 1
mistress 1
once 1
before 1
the 1
destined 1
ceremony 1
but 1
she 1
was 1
bathed 1
in 1
tears 1
and 1
throwing 1
herself 1
at 1
his 1
feet 1
entreated 1
him 1
to 1
spare 1
her 1
confessing 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
that 1
she 1
loved 1
another 1
but 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
poor 1
and 1
that 1
her 1
father 1
would 1
never 1
consent 1
to 1
the 1
union 1
My 1
generous 1
friend 1
reassured 1
the 1
suppliant 1
and 1
on 1
being 1
informed 1
of 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
her 1
lover 1
instantly 1
abandoned 1
his 1
pursuit 1
He 1
had 1
already 1
bought 1
a 1
farm 1
with 1
his 1
money 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
designed 1
to 1
pass 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
but 1
he 1
bestowed 1
the 1
whole 1
on 1
his 1
rival 1
together 1
with 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
his 1
prize 1
money 1
to 1
purchase 1
stock 1
and 1
then 1
himself 1
solicited 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
s 1
father 1
to 1
consent 1
to 1
her 1
marriage 1
with 1
her 1
lover 1
But 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
decidedly 1
refused 1
thinking 1
himself 1
bound 1
in 1
honour 1
to 1
my 1
friend 1
who 1
when 1
he 1
found 1
the 1
father 1
inexorable 1
quitted 1
his 1
country 1
nor 1
returned 1
until 1
he 1
heard 1
that 1
his 1
former 1
mistress 1
was 1
married 1
according 1
to 1
her 1
inclinations 1
What 1
a 1
noble 1
fellow 1
you 1
will 1
exclaim 1
He 1
is 1
so 1
but 1
then 1
he 1
is 1
wholly 1
uneducated 1
he 1
is 1
as 1
silent 1
as 1
a 1
Turk 1
and 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
ignorant 1
carelessness 1
attends 1
him 1
which 1
while 1
it 1
renders 1
his 1
conduct 1
the 1
more 1
astonishing 1
detracts 1
from 1
the 1
interest 1
and 1
sympathy 1
which 1
otherwise 1
he 1
would 1
command 1
Yet 1
do 1
not 1
suppose 1
because 1
I 1
complain 1
a 1
little 1
or 1
because 1
I 1
can 1
conceive 1
a 1
consolation 1
for 1
my 1
toils 1
which 1
I 1
may 1
never 1
know 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
wavering 1
in 1
my 1
resolutions 1
Those 1
are 1
as 1
fixed 1
as 1
fate 1
and 1
my 1
voyage 1
is 1
only 1
now 1
delayed 1
until 1
the 1
weather 1
shall 1
permit 1
my 1
embarkation 1
The 1
winter 1
has 1
been 1
dreadfully 1
severe 1
but 1
the 1
spring 1
promises 1
well 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
considered 1
as 1
a 1
remarkably 1
early 1
season 1
so 1
that 1
perhaps 1
I 1
may 1
sail 1
sooner 1
than 1
I 1
expected 1
I 1
shall 1
do 1
nothing 1
rashly 1
you 1
know 1
me 1
sufficiently 1
to 1
confide 1
in 1
my 1
prudence 1
and 1
considerateness 1
whenever 1
the 1
safety 1
of 1
others 1
is 1
committed 1
to 1
my 1
care 1
I 1
cannot 1
describe 1
to 1
you 1
my 1
sensations 1
on 1
the 1
near 1
prospect 1
of 1
my 1
undertaking 1
It 1
is 1
impossible 1
to 1
communicate 1
to 1
you 1
a 1
conception 1
of 1
the 1
trembling 1
sensation 1
half 1
pleasurable 1
and 1
half 1
fearful 1
with 1
which 1
I 1
am 1
preparing 1
to 1
depart 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
unexplored 1
regions 1
to 1
the 1
land 1
of 1
mist 1
and 1
snow 1
but 1
I 1
shall 1
kill 1
no 1
albatross 1
therefore 1
do 1
not 1
be 1
alarmed 1
for 1
my 1
safety 1
or 1
if 1
I 1
should 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
you 1
as 1
worn 1
and 1
woeful 1
as 1
the 1
Ancient 1
Mariner 1
You 1
will 1
smile 1
at 1
my 1
allusion 1
but 1
I 1
will 1
disclose 1
a 1
secret 1
I 1
have 1
often 1
attributed 1
my 1
attachment 1
to 1
my 1
passionate 1
enthusiasm 1
for 1
the 1
dangerous 1
mysteries 1
of 1
ocean 1
to 1
that 1
production 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
imaginative 1
of 1
modern 1
poets 1
There 1
is 1
something 1
at 1
work 1
in 1
my 1
soul 1
which 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
understand 1
I 1
am 1
practically 1
industrious 1
painstaking 1
a 1
workman 1
to 1
execute 1
with 1
perseverance 1
and 1
labour 1
but 1
besides 1
this 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
love 1
for 1
the 1
marvellous 1
a 1
belief 1
in 1
the 1
marvellous 1
intertwined 1
in 1
all 1
my 1
projects 1
which 1
hurries 1
me 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
common 1
pathways 1
of 1
men 1
even 1
to 1
the 1
wild 1
sea 1
and 1
unvisited 1
regions 1
I 1
am 1
about 1
to 1
explore 1
But 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
dearer 1
considerations 1
Shall 1
I 1
meet 1
you 1
again 1
after 1
having 1
traversed 1
immense 1
seas 1
and 1
returned 1
by 1
the 1
most 1
southern 1
cape 1
of 1
Africa 1
or 1
America 1
I 1
dare 1
not 1
expect 1
such 1
success 1
yet 1
I 1
cannot 1
bear 1
to 1
look 1
on 1
the 1
reverse 1
of 1
the 1
picture 1
Continue 1
for 1
the 1
present 1
to 1
write 1
to 1
me 1
by 1
every 1
opportunity 1
I 1
may 1
receive 1
your 1
letters 1
on 1
some 1
occasions 1
when 1
I 1
need 1
them 1
most 1
to 1
support 1
my 1
spirits 1
I 1
love 1
you 1
very 1
tenderly 1
Remember 1
me 1
with 1
affection 1
should 1
you 1
never 1
hear 1
from 1
me 1
again 1

To 1
Mrs 1
Saville 1
England 1
My 1
dear 1
Sister 1
I 1
write 1
a 1
few 1
lines 1
in 1
haste 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
safe 1
and 1
well 1
advanced 1
on 1
my 1
voyage 1
This 1
letter 1
will 1
reach 1
England 1
by 1
a 1
merchantman 1
now 1
on 1
its 1
homeward 1
voyage 1
from 1
Archangel 1
more 1
fortunate 1
than 1
I 1
who 1
may 1
not 1
see 1
my 1
native 1
land 1
perhaps 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
I 1
am 1
however 1
in 1
good 1
spirits 1
my 1
men 1
are 1
bold 1
and 1
apparently 1
firm 1
of 1
purpose 1
nor 1
do 1
the 1
floating 1
sheets 1
of 1
ice 1
that 1
continually 1
pass 1
us 1
indicating 1
the 1
dangers 1
of 1
the 1
region 1
towards 1
which 1
we 1
are 1
advancing 1
appear 1
to 1
dismay 1
them 1
We 1
have 1
already 1
reached 1
a 1
very 1
high 1
latitude 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
height 1
of 1
summer 1
and 1
although 1
not 1
so 1
warm 1
as 1
in 1
England 1
the 1
southern 1
gales 1
which 1
blow 1
us 1
speedily 1
towards 1
those 1
shores 1
which 1
I 1
so 1
ardently 1
desire 1
to 1
attain 1
breathe 1
a 1
degree 1
of 1
renovating 1
warmth 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
expected 1
No 1
incidents 1
have 1
hitherto 1
befallen 1
us 1
that 1
would 1
make 1
a 1
figure 1
in 1
a 1
letter 1
One 1
or 1
two 1
stiff 1
gales 1
and 1
the 1
springing 1
of 1
a 1
leak 1
are 1
accidents 1
which 1
experienced 1
navigators 1
scarcely 1
remember 1
to 1
record 1
and 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
well 1
content 1
if 1
nothing 1
worse 1
happen 1
to 1
us 1
during 1
our 1
voyage 1
Adieu 1
my 1
dear 1
Margaret 1
Be 1
assured 1
that 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
sake 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
yours 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
rashly 1
encounter 1
danger 1
I 1
will 1
be 1
cool 1
persevering 1
and 1
prudent 1
But 1
success 1
SHALL 1
crown 1
my 1
endeavours 1
Wherefore 1
not 1
Thus 1
far 1
I 1
have 1
gone 1
tracing 1
a 1
secure 1
way 1
over 1
the 1
pathless 1
seas 1
the 1
very 1
stars 1
themselves 1
being 1
witnesses 1
and 1
testimonies 1
of 1
my 1
triumph 1
Why 1
not 1
still 1
proceed 1
over 1
the 1
untamed 1
yet 1
obedient 1
element 1
What 1
can 1
stop 1
the 1
determined 1
heart 1
and 1
resolved 1
will 1
of 1
man 1
My 1
swelling 1
heart 1
involuntarily 1
pours 1
itself 1
out 1
thus 1
But 1
I 1
must 1
finish 1
Heaven 1
bless 1
my 1
beloved 1

Letter 1
August 1
th 1
To 1
Mrs 1
Saville 1
England 1
So 1
strange 1
an 1
accident 1
has 1
happened 1
to 1
us 1
that 1
I 1
cannot 1
forbear 1
recording 1
it 1
although 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
probable 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
me 1
before 1
these 1
papers 1
can 1
come 1
into 1
your 1
possession 1
Last 1
Monday 1
July 1
st 1
we 1
were 1
nearly 1
surrounded 1
by 1
ice 1
which 1
closed 1
in 1
the 1
ship 1
on 1
all 1
sides 1
scarcely 1
leaving 1
her 1
the 1
sea 1
room 1
in 1
which 1
she 1
floated 1
Our 1
situation 1
was 1
somewhat 1
dangerous 1
especially 1
as 1
we 1
were 1
compassed 1
round 1
by 1
a 1
very 1
thick 1
fog 1
We 1
accordingly 1
lay 1
to 1
hoping 1
that 1
some 1
change 1
would 1
take 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
atmosphere 1
and 1
weather 1
About 1
two 1
o 1
clock 1
the 1
mist 1
cleared 1
away 1
and 1
we 1
beheld 1
stretched 1
out 1
in 1
every 1
direction 1
vast 1
and 1
irregular 1
plains 1
of 1
ice 1
which 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
no 1
end 1
Some 1
of 1
my 1
comrades 1
groaned 1
and 1
my 1
own 1
mind 1
began 1
to 1
grow 1
watchful 1
with 1
anxious 1
thoughts 1
when 1
a 1
strange 1
sight 1
suddenly 1
attracted 1
our 1
attention 1
and 1
diverted 1
our 1
solicitude 1
from 1
our 1
own 1
situation 1
We 1
perceived 1
a 1
low 1
carriage 1
fixed 1
on 1
a 1
sledge 1
and 1
drawn 1
by 1
dogs 1
pass 1
on 1
towards 1
the 1
north 1
at 1
the 1
distance 1
of 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
a 1
being 1
which 1
had 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
but 1
apparently 1
of 1
gigantic 1
stature 1
sat 1
in 1
the 1
sledge 1
and 1
guided 1
the 1
dogs 1
We 1
watched 1
the 1
rapid 1
progress 1
of 1
the 1
traveller 1
with 1
our 1
telescopes 1
until 1
he 1
was 1
lost 1
among 1
the 1
distant 1
inequalities 1
of 1
the 1
ice 1
This 1
appearance 1
excited 1
our 1
unqualified 1
wonder 1
We 1
were 1
as 1
we 1
believed 1
many 1
hundred 1
miles 1
from 1
any 1
land 1
but 1
this 1
apparition 1
seemed 1
to 1
denote 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
in 1
reality 1
so 1
distant 1
as 1
we 1
had 1
supposed 1
Shut 1
in 1
however 1
by 1
ice 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
to 1
follow 1
his 1
track 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
observed 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
attention 1
About 1
two 1
hours 1
after 1
this 1
occurrence 1
we 1
heard 1
the 1
ground 1
sea 1
and 1
before 1
night 1
the 1
ice 1
broke 1
and 1
freed 1
our 1
ship 1
We 1
however 1
lay 1
to 1
until 1
the 1
morning 1
fearing 1
to 1
encounter 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
those 1
large 1
loose 1
masses 1
which 1
float 1
about 1
after 1
the 1
breaking 1
up 1
of 1
the 1
ice 1
I 1
profited 1
of 1
this 1
time 1
to 1
rest 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
In 1
the 1
morning 1
however 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
light 1
I 1
went 1
upon 1
deck 1
and 1
found 1
all 1
the 1
sailors 1
busy 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
vessel 1
apparently 1
talking 1
to 1
someone 1
in 1
the 1
sea 1
It 1
was 1
in 1
fact 1
a 1
sledge 1
like 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
seen 1
before 1
which 1
had 1
drifted 1
towards 1
us 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
on 1
a 1
large 1
fragment 1
of 1
ice 1
Only 1
one 1
dog 1
remained 1
alive 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
within 1
it 1
whom 1
the 1
sailors 1
were 1
persuading 1
to 1
enter 1
the 1
vessel 1
He 1
was 1
not 1
as 1
the 1
other 1
traveller 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
savage 1
inhabitant 1
of 1
some 1
undiscovered 1
island 1
but 1
a 1
European 1
When 1
I 1
appeared 1
on 1
deck 1
the 1
master 1
said 1
Here 1
is 1
our 1
captain 1
and 1
he 1
will 1
not 1
allow 1
you 1
to 1
perish 1
on 1
the 1
open 1
sea 1
On 1
perceiving 1
me 1
the 1
stranger 1
addressed 1
me 1
in 1
English 1
although 1
with 1
a 1
foreign 1
accent 1
Before 1
I 1
come 1
on 1
board 1
your 1
vessel 1
said 1
he 1
will 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
kindness 1
to 1
inform 1
me 1
whither 1
you 1
are 1
bound 1
You 1
may 1
conceive 1
my 1
astonishment 1
on 1
hearing 1
such 1
a 1
question 1
addressed 1
to 1
me 1
from 1
a 1
man 1
on 1
the 1
brink 1
of 1
destruction 1
and 1
to 1
whom 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
supposed 1
that 1
my 1
vessel 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
resource 1
which 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
exchanged 1
for 1
the 1
most 1
precious 1
wealth 1
the 1
earth 1
can 1
afford 1
I 1
replied 1
however 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
on 1
a 1
voyage 1
of 1
discovery 1
towards 1
the 1
northern 1
pole 1
Upon 1
hearing 1
this 1
he 1
appeared 1
satisfied 1
and 1
consented 1
to 1
come 1
on 1
board 1
Good 1
God 1
Margaret 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
seen 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
thus 1
capitulated 1
for 1
his 1
safety 1
your 1
surprise 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
boundless 1
His 1
limbs 1
were 1
nearly 1
frozen 1
and 1
his 1
body 1
dreadfully 1
emaciated 1
by 1
fatigue 1
and 1
suffering 1
I 1
never 1
saw 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
so 1
wretched 1
a 1
condition 1
We 1
attempted 1
to 1
carry 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
cabin 1
but 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
quitted 1
the 1
fresh 1
air 1
he 1
fainted 1
We 1
accordingly 1
brought 1
him 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
deck 1
and 1
restored 1
him 1
to 1
animation 1
by 1
rubbing 1
him 1
with 1
brandy 1
and 1
forcing 1
him 1
to 1
swallow 1
a 1
small 1
quantity 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
showed 1
signs 1
of 1
life 1
we 1
wrapped 1
him 1
up 1
in 1
blankets 1
and 1
placed 1
him 1
near 1
the 1
chimney 1
of 1
the 1
kitchen 1
stove 1
By 1
slow 1
degrees 1
he 1
recovered 1
and 1
ate 1
a 1
little 1
soup 1
which 1
restored 1
him 1
wonderfully 1
Two 1
days 1
passed 1
in 1
this 1
manner 1
before 1
he 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
speak 1
and 1
I 1
often 1
feared 1
that 1
his 1
sufferings 1
had 1
deprived 1
him 1
of 1
understanding 1
When 1
he 1
had 1
in 1
some 1
measure 1
recovered 1
I 1
removed 1
him 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
cabin 1
and 1
attended 1
on 1
him 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
my 1
duty 1
would 1
permit 1
I 1
never 1
saw 1
a 1
more 1
interesting 1
creature 1
his 1
eyes 1
have 1
generally 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
wildness 1
and 1
even 1
madness 1
but 1
there 1
are 1
moments 1
when 1
if 1
anyone 1
performs 1
an 1
act 1
of 1
kindness 1
towards 1
him 1
or 1
does 1
him 1
any 1
the 1
most 1
trifling 1
service 1
his 1
whole 1
countenance 1
is 1
lighted 1
up 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
with 1
a 1
beam 1
of 1
benevolence 1
and 1
sweetness 1
that 1
I 1
never 1
saw 1
equalled 1
But 1
he 1
is 1
generally 1
melancholy 1
and 1
despairing 1
and 1
sometimes 1
he 1
gnashes 1
his 1
teeth 1
as 1
if 1
impatient 1
of 1
the 1
weight 1
of 1
woes 1
that 1
oppresses 1
him 1
When 1
my 1
guest 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
recovered 1
I 1
had 1
great 1
trouble 1
to 1
keep 1
off 1
the 1
men 1
who 1
wished 1
to 1
ask 1
him 1
a 1
thousand 1
questions 1
but 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
allow 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
tormented 1
by 1
their 1
idle 1
curiosity 1
in 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
body 1
and 1
mind 1
whose 1
restoration 1
evidently 1
depended 1
upon 1
entire 1
repose 1
Once 1
however 1
the 1
lieutenant 1
asked 1
why 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
so 1
far 1
upon 1
the 1
ice 1
in 1
so 1
strange 1
a 1
vehicle 1
His 1
countenance 1
instantly 1
assumed 1
an 1
aspect 1
of 1
the 1
deepest 1
gloom 1
and 1
he 1
replied 1
To 1
seek 1
one 1
who 1
fled 1
from 1
me 1
And 1
did 1
the 1
man 1
whom 1
you 1
pursued 1
travel 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
fashion 1
Yes 1
Then 1
I 1
fancy 1
we 1
have 1
seen 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
we 1
picked 1
you 1
up 1
we 1
saw 1
some 1
dogs 1
drawing 1
a 1
sledge 1
with 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
it 1
across 1
the 1
ice 1
This 1
aroused 1
the 1
stranger 1
s 1
attention 1
and 1
he 1
asked 1
a 1
multitude 1
of 1
questions 1
concerning 1
the 1
route 1
which 1
the 1
demon 1
as 1
he 1
called 1
him 1
had 1
pursued 1
Soon 1
after 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
alone 1
with 1
me 1
he 1
said 1
I 1
have 1
doubtless 1
excited 1
your 1
curiosity 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
that 1
of 1
these 1
good 1
people 1
but 1
you 1
are 1
too 1
considerate 1
to 1
make 1
inquiries 1
Certainly 1
it 1
would 1
indeed 1
be 1
very 1
impertinent 1
and 1
inhuman 1
in 1
me 1
to 1
trouble 1
you 1
with 1
any 1
inquisitiveness 1
of 1
mine 1
And 1
yet 1
you 1
rescued 1
me 1
from 1
a 1
strange 1
and 1
perilous 1
situation 1
you 1
have 1
benevolently 1
restored 1
me 1
to 1
life 1
Soon 1
after 1
this 1
he 1
inquired 1
if 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
the 1
breaking 1
up 1
of 1
the 1
ice 1
had 1
destroyed 1
the 1
other 1
sledge 1
I 1
replied 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
answer 1
with 1
any 1
degree 1
of 1
certainty 1
for 1
the 1
ice 1
had 1
not 1
broken 1
until 1
near 1
midnight 1
and 1
the 1
traveller 1
might 1
have 1
arrived 1
at 1
a 1
place 1
of 1
safety 1
before 1
that 1
time 1
but 1
of 1
this 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
judge 1
From 1
this 1
time 1
a 1
new 1
spirit 1
of 1
life 1
animated 1
the 1
decaying 1
frame 1
of 1
the 1
stranger 1
He 1
manifested 1
the 1
greatest 1
eagerness 1
to 1
be 1
upon 1
deck 1
to 1
watch 1
for 1
the 1
sledge 1
which 1
had 1
before 1
appeared 1
but 1
I 1
have 1
persuaded 1
him 1
to 1
remain 1
in 1
the 1
cabin 1
for 1
he 1
is 1
far 1
too 1
weak 1
to 1
sustain 1
the 1
rawness 1
of 1
the 1
atmosphere 1
I 1
have 1
promised 1
that 1
someone 1
should 1
watch 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
give 1
him 1
instant 1
notice 1
if 1
any 1
new 1
object 1
should 1
appear 1
in 1
sight 1
Such 1
is 1
my 1
journal 1
of 1
what 1
relates 1
to 1
this 1
strange 1
occurrence 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
present 1
day 1
The 1
stranger 1
has 1
gradually 1
improved 1
in 1
health 1
but 1
is 1
very 1
silent 1
and 1
appears 1
uneasy 1
when 1
anyone 1
except 1
myself 1
enters 1
his 1
cabin 1
Yet 1
his 1
manners 1
are 1
so 1
conciliating 1
and 1
gentle 1
that 1
the 1
sailors 1
are 1
all 1
interested 1
in 1
him 1
although 1
they 1
have 1
had 1
very 1
little 1
communication 1
with 1
him 1
For 1
my 1
own 1
part 1
I 1
begin 1
to 1
love 1
him 1
as 1
a 1
brother 1
and 1
his 1
constant 1
and 1
deep 1
grief 1
fills 1
me 1
with 1
sympathy 1
and 1
compassion 1
He 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
noble 1
creature 1
in 1
his 1
better 1
days 1
being 1
even 1
now 1
in 1
wreck 1
so 1
attractive 1
and 1
amiable 1
I 1
said 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
letters 1
my 1
dear 1
Margaret 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
find 1
no 1
friend 1
on 1
the 1
wide 1
ocean 1
yet 1
I 1
have 1
found 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
before 1
his 1
spirit 1
had 1
been 1
broken 1
by 1
misery 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
happy 1
to 1
have 1
possessed 1
as 1
the 1
brother 1
of 1
my 1
heart 1
I 1
shall 1
continue 1
my 1
journal 1
concerning 1
the 1
stranger 1
at 1
intervals 1
should 1
I 1
have 1
any 1
fresh 1
incidents 1
to 1
record 1
August 1
th 1
My 1
affection 1
for 1
my 1
guest 1
increases 1
every 1
day 1
He 1
excites 1
at 1
once 1
my 1
admiration 1
and 1
my 1
pity 1
to 1
an 1
astonishing 1
degree 1
How 1
can 1
I 1
see 1
so 1
noble 1
a 1
creature 1
destroyed 1
by 1
misery 1
without 1
feeling 1
the 1
most 1
poignant 1
grief 1
He 1
is 1
so 1
gentle 1
yet 1
so 1
wise 1
his 1
mind 1
is 1
so 1
cultivated 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
speaks 1
although 1
his 1
words 1
are 1
culled 1
with 1
the 1
choicest 1
art 1
yet 1
they 1
flow 1
with 1
rapidity 1
and 1
unparalleled 1
eloquence 1
He 1
is 1
now 1
much 1
recovered 1
from 1
his 1
illness 1
and 1
is 1
continually 1
on 1
the 1
deck 1
apparently 1
watching 1
for 1
the 1
sledge 1
that 1
preceded 1
his 1
own 1
Yet 1
although 1
unhappy 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
so 1
utterly 1
occupied 1
by 1
his 1
own 1
misery 1
but 1
that 1
he 1
interests 1
himself 1
deeply 1
in 1
the 1
projects 1
of 1
others 1
He 1
has 1
frequently 1
conversed 1
with 1
me 1
on 1
mine 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
communicated 1
to 1
him 1
without 1
disguise 1
He 1
entered 1
attentively 1
into 1
all 1
my 1
arguments 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
my 1
eventual 1
success 1
and 1
into 1
every 1
minute 1
detail 1
of 1
the 1
measures 1
I 1
had 1
taken 1
to 1
secure 1
it 1
I 1
was 1
easily 1
led 1
by 1
the 1
sympathy 1
which 1
he 1
evinced 1
to 1
use 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
my 1
heart 1
to 1
give 1
utterance 1
to 1
the 1
burning 1
ardour 1
of 1
my 1
soul 1
and 1
to 1
say 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
fervour 1
that 1
warmed 1
me 1
how 1
gladly 1
I 1
would 1
sacrifice 1
my 1
fortune 1
my 1
existence 1
my 1
every 1
hope 1
to 1
the 1
furtherance 1
of 1
my 1
enterprise 1
One 1
man 1
s 1
life 1
or 1
death 1
were 1
but 1
a 1
small 1
price 1
to 1
pay 1
for 1
the 1
acquirement 1
of 1
the 1
knowledge 1
which 1
I 1
sought 1
for 1
the 1
dominion 1
I 1
should 1
acquire 1
and 1
transmit 1
over 1
the 1
elemental 1
foes 1
of 1
our 1
race 1
As 1
I 1
spoke 1
a 1
dark 1
gloom 1
spread 1
over 1
my 1
listener 1
s 1
countenance 1
At 1
first 1
I 1
perceived 1
that 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
suppress 1
his 1
emotion 1
he 1
placed 1
his 1
hands 1
before 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
my 1
voice 1
quivered 1
and 1
failed 1
me 1
as 1
I 1
beheld 1
tears 1
trickle 1
fast 1
from 1
between 1
his 1
fingers 1
a 1
groan 1
burst 1
from 1
his 1
heaving 1
breast 1
I 1
paused 1
at 1
length 1
he 1
spoke 1
in 1
broken 1
accents 1
Unhappy 1
man 1
Do 1
you 1
share 1
my 1
madness 1
Have 1
you 1
drunk 1
also 1
of 1
the 1
intoxicating 1
draught 1
Hear 1
me 1
let 1
me 1
reveal 1
my 1
tale 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
dash 1
the 1
cup 1
from 1
your 1
lips 1
Such 1
words 1
you 1
may 1
imagine 1
strongly 1
excited 1
my 1
curiosity 1
but 1
the 1
paroxysm 1
of 1
grief 1
that 1
had 1
seized 1
the 1
stranger 1
overcame 1
his 1
weakened 1
powers 1
and 1
many 1
hours 1
of 1
repose 1
and 1
tranquil 1
conversation 1
were 1
necessary 1
to 1
restore 1
his 1
composure 1
Having 1
conquered 1
the 1
violence 1
of 1
his 1
feelings 1
he 1
appeared 1
to 1
despise 1
himself 1
for 1
being 1
the 1
slave 1
of 1
passion 1
and 1
quelling 1
the 1
dark 1
tyranny 1
of 1
despair 1
he 1
led 1
me 1
again 1
to 1
converse 1
concerning 1
myself 1
personally 1
He 1
asked 1
me 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
my 1
earlier 1
years 1
The 1
tale 1
was 1
quickly 1
told 1
but 1
it 1
awakened 1
various 1
trains 1
of 1
reflection 1
I 1
spoke 1
of 1
my 1
desire 1
of 1
finding 1
a 1
friend 1
of 1
my 1
thirst 1
for 1
a 1
more 1
intimate 1
sympathy 1
with 1
a 1
fellow 1
mind 1
than 1
had 1
ever 1
fallen 1
to 1
my 1
lot 1
and 1
expressed 1
my 1
conviction 1
that 1
a 1
man 1
could 1
boast 1
of 1
little 1
happiness 1
who 1
did 1
not 1
enjoy 1
this 1
blessing 1
I 1
agree 1
with 1
you 1
replied 1
the 1
stranger 1
we 1
are 1
unfashioned 1
creatures 1
but 1
half 1
made 1
up 1
if 1
one 1
wiser 1
better 1
dearer 1
than 1
ourselves 1
such 1
a 1
friend 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
do 1
not 1
lend 1
his 1
aid 1
to 1
perfectionate 1
our 1
weak 1
and 1
faulty 1
natures 1
I 1
once 1
had 1
a 1
friend 1
the 1
most 1
noble 1
of 1
human 1
creatures 1
and 1
am 1
entitled 1
therefore 1
to 1
judge 1
respecting 1
friendship 1
You 1
have 1
hope 1
and 1
the 1
world 1
before 1
you 1
and 1
have 1
no 1
cause 1
for 1
despair 1
But 1
I 2
have 1
lost 1
everything 1
and 1
cannot 1
begin 1
life 1
anew 1
As 1
he 1
said 1
this 1
his 1
countenance 1
became 1
expressive 1
of 1
a 1
calm 1
settled 1
grief 1
that 1
touched 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
heart 1
But 1
he 1
was 1
silent 1
and 1
presently 1
retired 1
to 1
his 1
cabin 1
Even 1
broken 1
in 1
spirit 1
as 1
he 1
is 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
feel 1
more 1
deeply 1
than 1
he 1
does 1
the 1
beauties 1
of 1
nature 1
The 1
starry 1
sky 1
the 1
sea 1
and 1
every 1
sight 1
afforded 1
by 1
these 1
wonderful 1
regions 1
seem 1
still 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
elevating 1
his 1
soul 1
from 1
earth 1
Such 1
a 1
man 1
has 1
a 1
double 1
existence 1
he 1
may 1
suffer 1
misery 1
and 1
be 1
overwhelmed 1
by 1
disappointments 1
yet 1
when 1
he 1
has 1
retired 1
into 1
himself 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
like 1
a 1
celestial 1
spirit 1
that 1
has 1
a 1
halo 1
around 1
him 1
within 1
whose 1
circle 1
no 1
grief 1
or 1
folly 1
ventures 1
Will 1
you 1
smile 1
at 1
the 1
enthusiasm 1
I 1
express 1
concerning 1
this 1
divine 1
wanderer 1
You 1
would 1
not 1
if 1
you 1
saw 1
him 1
You 1
have 1
been 1
tutored 1
and 1
refined 1
by 1
books 1
and 1
retirement 1
from 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
therefore 1
somewhat 1
fastidious 1
but 1
this 1
only 1
renders 1
you 1
the 1
more 1
fit 1
to 1
appreciate 1
the 1
extraordinary 1
merits 1
of 1
this 1
wonderful 1
man 1
Sometimes 1
I 1
have 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
discover 1
what 1
quality 1
it 1
is 1
which 1
he 1
possesses 1
that 1
elevates 1
him 1
so 1
immeasurably 1
above 1
any 1
other 1
person 1
I 1
ever 1
knew 1
I 1
believe 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
an 1
intuitive 1
discernment 1
a 1
quick 1
but 1
never 1
failing 1
power 1
of 1
judgment 1
a 1
penetration 1
into 1
the 1
causes 1
of 1
things 1
unequalled 1
for 1
clearness 1
and 1
precision 1
add 1
to 1
this 1
a 1
facility 1
of 1
expression 1
and 1
a 1
voice 1
whose 1
varied 1
intonations 1
are 1
soul 1
subduing 1
music 1
August 1
Yesterday 1
the 1
stranger 1
said 1
to 1
me 1
You 1
may 1
easily 1
perceive 1
Captain 1
Walton 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
suffered 1
great 1
and 1
unparalleled 1
misfortunes 1
I 1
had 1
determined 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
that 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
these 1
evils 1
should 1
die 1
with 1
me 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
won 1
me 1
to 1
alter 1
my 1
determination 1
You 1
seek 1
for 1
knowledge 1
and 1
wisdom 1
as 1
I 1
once 1
did 1
and 1
I 1
ardently 1
hope 1
that 1
the 1
gratification 1
of 1
your 1
wishes 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
a 1
serpent 1
to 1
sting 1
you 1
as 1
mine 1
has 1
been 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
relation 1
of 1
my 1
disasters 1
will 1
be 1
useful 1
to 1
you 1
yet 1
when 1
I 1
reflect 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
pursuing 1
the 1
same 1
course 1
exposing 1
yourself 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
dangers 1
which 1
have 1
rendered 1
me 1
what 1
I 1
am 1
I 1
imagine 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
deduce 1
an 1
apt 1
moral 1
from 1
my 1
tale 1
one 1
that 1
may 1
direct 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
succeed 1
in 1
your 1
undertaking 1
and 1
console 1
you 1
in 1
case 1
of 1
failure 1
Prepare 1
to 1
hear 1
of 1
occurrences 1
which 1
are 1
usually 1
deemed 1
marvellous 1
Were 1
we 1
among 1
the 1
tamer 1
scenes 1
of 1
nature 1
I 1
might 1
fear 1
to 1
encounter 1
your 1
unbelief 1
perhaps 1
your 1
ridicule 1
but 1
many 1
things 1
will 1
appear 1
possible 1
in 1
these 1
wild 1
and 1
mysterious 1
regions 1
which 1
would 1
provoke 1
the 1
laughter 1
of 1
those 1
unacquainted 1
with 1
the 1
ever 1
varied 1
powers 1
of 1
nature 1
nor 1
can 1
I 1
doubt 1
but 1
that 1
my 1
tale 1
conveys 1
in 1
its 1
series 1
internal 1
evidence 1
of 1
the 1
truth 1
of 1
the 1
events 1
of 1
which 1
it 1
is 1
composed 1
You 1
may 1
easily 1
imagine 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
much 1
gratified 1
by 1
the 1
offered 1
communication 1
yet 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
endure 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
renew 1
his 1
grief 1
by 1
a 1
recital 1
of 1
his 1
misfortunes 1
I 1
felt 1
the 1
greatest 1
eagerness 1
to 1
hear 1
the 1
promised 1
narrative 1
partly 1
from 1
curiosity 1
and 1
partly 1
from 1
a 1
strong 1
desire 1
to 1
ameliorate 1
his 1
fate 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
I 1
expressed 1
these 1
feelings 1
in 1
my 1
answer 1
I 1
thank 1
you 1
he 1
replied 1
for 1
your 1
sympathy 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
useless 1
my 1
fate 1
is 1
nearly 1
fulfilled 1
I 1
wait 1
but 1
for 1
one 1
event 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
shall 1
repose 1
in 1
peace 1
I 1
understand 1
your 1
feeling 1
continued 1
he 1
perceiving 1
that 1
I 1
wished 1
to 1
interrupt 1
him 1
but 1
you 1
are 1
mistaken 1
my 1
friend 1
if 1
thus 1
you 1
will 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
name 1
you 1
nothing 1
can 1
alter 1
my 1
destiny 1
listen 1
to 1
my 1
history 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
perceive 1
how 1
irrevocably 1
it 1
is 1
determined 1
He 1
then 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
commence 1
his 1
narrative 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
when 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
at 1
leisure 1
This 1
promise 1
drew 1
from 1
me 1
the 1
warmest 1
thanks 1
I 1
have 1
resolved 1
every 1
night 1
when 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
imperatively 1
occupied 1
by 1
my 1
duties 1
to 1
record 1
as 1
nearly 1
as 1
possible 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
words 1
what 1
he 1
has 1
related 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
If 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
engaged 1
I 1
will 1
at 1
least 1
make 1
notes 1
This 1
manuscript 1
will 1
doubtless 1
afford 1
you 1
the 1
greatest 1
pleasure 1
but 1
to 1
me 1
who 1
know 1
him 1
and 1
who 1
hear 1
it 1
from 1
his 1
own 1
lips 1
with 1
what 1
interest 1
and 1
sympathy 1
shall 1
I 1
read 1
it 1
in 1
some 1
future 1
day 1
Even 1
now 1
as 1
I 1
commence 1
my 1
task 1
his 1
full 1
toned 1
voice 1
swells 1
in 1
my 1
ears 1
his 1
lustrous 1
eyes 1
dwell 1
on 1
me 1
with 1
all 1
their 1
melancholy 1
sweetness 1
I 1
see 1
his 1
thin 1
hand 1
raised 1
in 1
animation 1
while 1
the 1
lineaments 1
of 1
his 1
face 1
are 1
irradiated 1
by 1
the 1
soul 1
within 1
Strange 1
and 1
harrowing 1
must 1
be 1
his 1
story 1
frightful 1
the 1
storm 1
which 1
embraced 1
the 1
gallant 1
vessel 1
on 1
its 1
course 1
and 1
wrecked 1
it 1
thus 1
Chapter 1
I 1
am 1
by 1
birth 1
a 1
Genevese 1
and 1
my 1
family 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
distinguished 1
of 1
that 1
republic 1
My 1
ancestors 1
had 1
been 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
counsellors 1
and 1
syndics 1
and 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
filled 1
several 1
public 1
situations 1
with 1
honour 1
and 1
reputation 1
He 1
was 1
respected 1
by 1
all 1
who 1
knew 1
him 1
for 1
his 1
integrity 1
and 1
indefatigable 1
attention 1
to 1
public 1
business 1
He 1
passed 1
his 1
younger 1
days 1
perpetually 1
occupied 1
by 1
the 1
affairs 1
of 1
his 1
country 1
a 1
variety 1
of 1
circumstances 1
had 1
prevented 1
his 1
marrying 1
early 1
nor 1
was 1
it 1
until 1
the 1
decline 1
of 1
life 1
that 1
he 1
became 1
a 1
husband 1
and 1
the 1
father 1
of 1
a 1
family 1
As 1
the 1
circumstances 1
of 1
his 1
marriage 1
illustrate 1
his 1
character 1
I 1
cannot 1
refrain 1
from 1
relating 1
them 1
One 1
of 1
his 1
most 1
intimate 1
friends 1
was 1
a 1
merchant 1
who 1
from 1
a 1
flourishing 1
state 1
fell 1
through 1
numerous 1
mischances 1
into 1
poverty 1
This 1
man 1
whose 1
name 1
was 1
Beaufort 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
proud 1
and 1
unbending 1
disposition 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
poverty 1
and 1
oblivion 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
country 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
formerly 1
been 1
distinguished 1
for 1
his 1
rank 1
and 1
magnificence 1
Having 1
paid 1
his 1
debts 1
therefore 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
honourable 1
manner 1
he 1
retreated 1
with 1
his 1
daughter 1
to 1
the 1
town 1
of 1
Lucerne 1
where 1
he 1
lived 1
unknown 1
and 1
in 1
wretchedness 1
My 1
father 1
loved 1
Beaufort 1
with 1
the 1
truest 1
friendship 1
and 1
was 1
deeply 1
grieved 1
by 1
his 1
retreat 1
in 1
these 1
unfortunate 1
circumstances 1
He 1
bitterly 1
deplored 1
the 1
false 1
pride 1
which 1
led 1
his 1
friend 1
to 1
a 1
conduct 1
so 1
little 1
worthy 1
of 1
the 1
affection 1
that 1
united 1
them 1
He 1
lost 1
no 1
time 1
in 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
seek 1
him 1
out 1
with 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
persuading 1
him 1
to 1
begin 1
the 1
world 1
again 1
through 1
his 1
credit 1
and 1
assistance 1
Beaufort 1
had 1
taken 1
effectual 1
measures 1
to 1
conceal 1
himself 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
ten 1
months 1
before 1
my 1
father 1
discovered 1
his 1
abode 1
Overjoyed 1
at 1
this 1
discovery 1
he 1
hastened 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
which 1
was 1
situated 1
in 1
a 1
mean 1
street 1
near 1
the 1
Reuss 1
But 1
when 1
he 1
entered 1
misery 1
and 1
despair 1
alone 1
welcomed 1
him 1
Beaufort 1
had 1
saved 1
but 1
a 1
very 1
small 1
sum 1
of 1
money 1
from 1
the 1
wreck 1
of 1
his 1
fortunes 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
sufficient 1
to 1
provide 1
him 1
with 1
sustenance 1
for 1
some 1
months 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
he 1
hoped 1
to 1
procure 1
some 1
respectable 1
employment 1
in 1
a 1
merchant 1
s 1
house 1
The 1
interval 1
was 1
consequently 1
spent 1
in 1
inaction 1
his 1
grief 1
only 1
became 1
more 1
deep 1
and 1
rankling 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
leisure 1
for 1
reflection 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
it 1
took 1
so 1
fast 1
hold 1
of 1
his 1
mind 1
that 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
three 1
months 1
he 1
lay 1
on 1
a 1
bed 1
of 1
sickness 1
incapable 1
of 1
any 1
exertion 1
His 1
daughter 1
attended 1
him 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
tenderness 1
but 1
she 1
saw 1
with 1
despair 1
that 1
their 1
little 1
fund 1
was 1
rapidly 1
decreasing 1
and 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
other 1
prospect 1
of 1
support 1
But 1
Caroline 1
Beaufort 1
possessed 1
a 1
mind 1
of 1
an 1
uncommon 1
mould 1
and 1
her 1
courage 1
rose 1
to 1
support 1
her 1
in 1
her 1
adversity 1
She 1
procured 1
plain 1
work 1
she 1
plaited 1
straw 1
and 1
by 1
various 1
means 1
contrived 1
to 1
earn 1
a 1
pittance 1
scarcely 1
sufficient 1
to 1
support 1
life 1
Several 1
months 1
passed 1
in 1
this 1
manner 1
Her 1
father 1
grew 1
worse 1
her 1
time 1
was 1
more 1
entirely 1
occupied 1
in 1
attending 1
him 1
her 1
means 1
of 1
subsistence 1
decreased 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
tenth 1
month 1
her 1
father 1
died 1
in 1
her 1
arms 1
leaving 1
her 1
an 1
orphan 1
and 1
a 1
beggar 1
This 1
last 1
blow 1
overcame 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
knelt 1
by 1
Beaufort 1
s 1
coffin 1
weeping 1
bitterly 1
when 1
my 1
father 1
entered 1
the 1
chamber 1
He 1
came 1
like 1
a 1
protecting 1
spirit 1
to 1
the 1
poor 1
girl 1
who 1
committed 1
herself 1
to 1
his 1
care 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
interment 1
of 1
his 1
friend 1
he 1
conducted 1
her 1
to 1
Geneva 1
and 1
placed 1
her 1
under 1
the 1
protection 1
of 1
a 1
relation 1
Two 1
years 1
after 1
this 1
event 1
Caroline 1
became 1
his 1
wife 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
considerable 1
difference 1
between 1
the 1
ages 1
of 1
my 1
parents 1
but 1
this 1
circumstance 1
seemed 1
to 1
unite 1
them 1
only 1
closer 1
in 1
bonds 1
of 1
devoted 1
affection 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
justice 1
in 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
upright 1
mind 1
which 1
rendered 1
it 1
necessary 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
approve 1
highly 1
to 1
love 1
strongly 1
Perhaps 1
during 1
former 1
years 1
he 1
had 1
suffered 1
from 1
the 1
late 1
discovered 1
unworthiness 1
of 1
one 1
beloved 1
and 1
so 1
was 1
disposed 1
to 1
set 1
a 1
greater 1
value 1
on 1
tried 1
worth 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
show 1
of 1
gratitude 1
and 1
worship 1
in 1
his 1
attachment 1
to 1
my 1
mother 1
differing 1
wholly 1
from 1
the 1
doting 1
fondness 1
of 1
age 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
inspired 1
by 1
reverence 1
for 1
her 1
virtues 1
and 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
in 1
some 1
degree 1
recompensing 1
her 1
for 1
the 1
sorrows 1
she 1
had 1
endured 1
but 1
which 1
gave 1
inexpressible 1
grace 1
to 1
his 1
behaviour 1
to 1
her 1
Everything 1
was 1
made 1
to 1
yield 1
to 1
her 1
wishes 1
and 1
her 1
convenience 1
He 1
strove 1
to 1
shelter 1
her 1
as 1
a 1
fair 1
exotic 1
is 1
sheltered 1
by 1
the 1
gardener 1
from 1
every 1
rougher 1
wind 1
and 1
to 1
surround 1
her 1
with 1
all 1
that 1
could 1
tend 1
to 1
excite 1
pleasurable 1
emotion 1
in 1
her 1
soft 1
and 1
benevolent 1
mind 1
Her 1
health 1
and 1
even 1
the 1
tranquillity 1
of 1
her 1
hitherto 1
constant 1
spirit 1
had 1
been 1
shaken 1
by 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
gone 1
through 1
During 1
the 1
two 1
years 1
that 1
had 1
elapsed 1
previous 1
to 1
their 1
marriage 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
gradually 1
relinquished 1
all 1
his 1
public 1
functions 1
and 1
immediately 1
after 1
their 1
union 1
they 1
sought 1
the 1
pleasant 1
climate 1
of 1
Italy 1
and 1
the 1
change 1
of 1
scene 1
and 1
interest 1
attendant 1
on 1
a 1
tour 1
through 1
that 1
land 1
of 1
wonders 1
as 1
a 1
restorative 1
for 1
her 1
weakened 1
frame 1
From 1
Italy 1
they 1
visited 1
Germany 1
and 1
France 1
I 1
their 1
eldest 1
child 1
was 1
born 1
at 1
Naples 1
and 1
as 1
an 1
infant 1
accompanied 1
them 1
in 1
their 1
rambles 1
I 1
remained 1
for 1
several 1
years 1
their 1
only 1
child 1
Much 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
attached 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
draw 1
inexhaustible 1
stores 1
of 1
affection 1
from 1
a 1
very 1
mine 1
of 1
love 1
to 1
bestow 1
them 1
upon 1
me 1
My 1
mother 1
s 1
tender 1
caresses 1
and 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
smile 1
of 1
benevolent 1
pleasure 1
while 1
regarding 1
me 1
are 1
my 1
first 1
recollections 1
I 1
was 1
their 1
plaything 1
and 1
their 1
idol 1
and 1
something 1
better 1
their 1
child 1
the 1
innocent 1
and 1
helpless 1
creature 1
bestowed 1
on 1
them 1
by 1
heaven 1
whom 1
to 1
bring 1
up 1
to 1
good 1
and 1
whose 1
future 1
lot 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
their 1
hands 1
to 1
direct 1
to 1
happiness 1
or 1
misery 1
according 1
as 1
they 1
fulfilled 1
their 1
duties 1
towards 1
me 1
With 1
this 1
deep 1
consciousness 1
of 1
what 1
they 1
owed 1
towards 1
the 1
being 1
to 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
given 1
life 1
added 1
to 1
the 1
active 1
spirit 1
of 1
tenderness 1
that 1
animated 1
both 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
imagined 1
that 1
while 1
during 1
every 1
hour 1
of 1
my 1
infant 1
life 1
I 1
received 1
a 1
lesson 1
of 1
patience 1
of 1
charity 1
and 1
of 1
self 1
control 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
guided 1
by 1
a 1
silken 1
cord 1
that 1
all 1
seemed 1
but 1
one 1
train 1
of 1
enjoyment 1
to 1
me 1
For 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
I 1
was 1
their 1
only 1
care 1
My 1
mother 1
had 1
much 1
desired 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
daughter 1
but 1
I 1
continued 1
their 1
single 1
offspring 1
When 1
I 1
was 1
about 1
five 1
years 1
old 1
while 1
making 1
an 1
excursion 1
beyond 1
the 1
frontiers 1
of 1
Italy 1
they 1
passed 1
a 1
week 1
on 1
the 1
shores 1
of 1
the 1
Lake 1
of 1
Como 1
Their 1
benevolent 1
disposition 1
often 1
made 1
them 1
enter 1
the 1
cottages 1
of 1
the 1
poor 1
This 1
to 1
my 1
mother 1
was 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
duty 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
necessity 1
a 1
passion 1
remembering 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
suffered 1
and 1
how 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
relieved 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
act 1
in 1
her 1
turn 1
the 1
guardian 1
angel 1
to 1
the 1
afflicted 1
During 1
one 1
of 1
their 1
walks 1
a 1
poor 1
cot 1
in 1
the 1
foldings 1
of 1
a 1
vale 1
attracted 1
their 1
notice 1
as 1
being 1
singularly 1
disconsolate 1
while 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
half 1
clothed 1
children 1
gathered 1
about 1
it 1
spoke 1
of 1
penury 1
in 1
its 1
worst 1
shape 1
One 1
day 1
when 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
gone 1
by 1
himself 1
to 1
Milan 1
my 1
mother 1
accompanied 1
by 1
me 1
visited 1
this 1
abode 1
She 1
found 1
a 1
peasant 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
hard 1
working 1
bent 1
down 1
by 1
care 1
and 1
labour 1
distributing 1
a 1
scanty 1
meal 1
to 1
five 1
hungry 1
babes 1
Among 1
these 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
which 1
attracted 1
my 1
mother 1
far 1
above 1
all 1
the 1
rest 1
She 1
appeared 1
of 1
a 1
different 1
stock 1
The 1
four 1
others 1
were 1
dark 1
eyed 1
hardy 1
little 1
vagrants 1
this 1
child 1
was 1
thin 1
and 1
very 1
fair 1
Her 1
hair 1
was 1
the 1
brightest 1
living 1
gold 1
and 1
despite 1
the 1
poverty 1
of 1
her 1
clothing 1
seemed 1
to 1
set 1
a 1
crown 1
of 1
distinction 1
on 1
her 1
head 1
Her 1
brow 1
was 1
clear 1
and 1
ample 1
her 1
blue 1
eyes 1
cloudless 1
and 1
her 1
lips 1
and 1
the 1
moulding 1
of 1
her 1
face 1
so 1
expressive 1
of 1
sensibility 1
and 1
sweetness 1
that 1
none 1
could 1
behold 1
her 1
without 1
looking 1
on 1
her 1
as 1
of 1
a 1
distinct 1
species 1
a 1
being 1
heaven 1
sent 1
and 1
bearing 1
a 1
celestial 1
stamp 1
in 1
all 1
her 1
features 1
The 1
peasant 1
woman 1
perceiving 1
that 1
my 1
mother 1
fixed 1
eyes 1
of 1
wonder 1
and 1
admiration 1
on 1
this 1
lovely 1
girl 1
eagerly 1
communicated 1
her 1
history 1
She 1
was 1
not 1
her 1
child 1
but 1
the 1
daughter 1
of 1
a 1
Milanese 1
nobleman 1
Her 1
mother 1
was 1
a 1
German 1
and 1
had 1
died 1
on 1
giving 1
her 1
birth 1
The 1
infant 1
had 1
been 1
placed 1
with 1
these 1
good 1
people 1
to 1
nurse 1
they 1
were 1
better 1
off 1
then 1
They 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
long 1
married 1
and 1
their 1
eldest 1
child 1
was 1
but 1
just 1
born 1
The 1
father 1
of 1
their 1
charge 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
Italians 1
nursed 1
in 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
antique 1
glory 1
of 1
Italy 1
one 1
among 1
the 1
schiavi 1
ognor 1
frementi 1
who 1
exerted 1
himself 1
to 1
obtain 1
the 1
liberty 1
of 1
his 1
country 1
He 1
became 1
the 1
victim 1
of 1
its 1
weakness 1
Whether 1
he 1
had 1
died 1
or 1
still 1
lingered 1
in 1
the 1
dungeons 1
of 1
Austria 1
was 1
not 1
known 1
His 1
property 1
was 1
confiscated 1
his 1
child 1
became 1
an 1
orphan 1
and 1
a 1
beggar 1
She 1
continued 1
with 1
her 1
foster 1
parents 1
and 1
bloomed 1
in 1
their 1
rude 1
abode 1
fairer 1
than 1
a 1
garden 1
rose 1
among 1
dark 1
leaved 1
brambles 1
When 1
my 1
father 1
returned 1
from 1
Milan 1
he 1
found 1
playing 1
with 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
hall 1
of 1
our 1
villa 1
a 1
child 1
fairer 1
than 1
pictured 1
cherub 1
a 1
creature 1
who 1
seemed 1
to 1
shed 1
radiance 1
from 1
her 1
looks 1
and 1
whose 1
form 1
and 1
motions 1
were 1
lighter 1
than 1
the 1
chamois 1
of 1
the 1
hills 1
The 1
apparition 1
was 1
soon 1
explained 1
With 1
his 1
permission 1
my 1
mother 1
prevailed 1
on 1
her 1
rustic 1
guardians 1
to 1
yield 1
their 1
charge 1
to 1
her 1
They 1
were 1
fond 1
of 1
the 1
sweet 1
orphan 1
Her 1
presence 1
had 1
seemed 1
a 1
blessing 1
to 1
them 1
but 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
unfair 1
to 1
her 1
to 1
keep 1
her 1
in 1
poverty 1
and 1
want 1
when 1
Providence 1
afforded 1
her 1
such 1
powerful 1
protection 1
They 1
consulted 1
their 1
village 1
priest 1
and 1
the 1
result 1
was 1
that 1
Elizabeth 1
Lavenza 1
became 1
the 1
inmate 1
of 1
my 1
parents 1
house 1
my 1
more 1
than 1
sister 1
the 1
beautiful 1
and 1
adored 1
companion 1
of 1
all 1
my 1
occupations 1
and 1
my 1
pleasures 1
Everyone 1
loved 1
Elizabeth 1
The 1
passionate 1
and 1
almost 1
reverential 1
attachment 1
with 1
which 1
all 1
regarded 1
her 1
became 1
while 1
I 1
shared 1
it 1
my 1
pride 1
and 1
my 1
delight 1
On 1
the 1
evening 1
previous 1
to 1
her 1
being 1
brought 1
to 1
my 1
home 1
my 1
mother 1
had 1
said 1
playfully 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
pretty 1
present 1
for 1
my 1
Victor 1
tomorrow 1
he 1
shall 1
have 1
it 1
And 1
when 1
on 1
the 1
morrow 1
she 1
presented 1
Elizabeth 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
her 1
promised 1
gift 1
I 1
with 1
childish 1
seriousness 1
interpreted 1
her 1
words 1
literally 1
and 1
looked 1
upon 1
Elizabeth 1
as 1
mine 2
to 1
protect 1
love 1
and 1
cherish 1
All 1
praises 1
bestowed 1
on 1
her 1
I 1
received 1
as 1
made 1
to 1
a 1
possession 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
We 1
called 1
each 1
other 1
familiarly 1
by 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
cousin 1
No 1
word 1
no 1
expression 1
could 1
body 1
forth 1
the 1
kind 1
of 1
relation 1
in 1
which 1
she 1
stood 1
to 1
me 1
my 1
more 1
than 1
sister 1
since 1
till 1
death 1
she 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
mine 1
only 1
Chapter 1
We 1
were 1
brought 1
up 1
together 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
quite 1
a 1
year 1
difference 1
in 1
our 1
ages 1
I 1
need 1
not 1
say 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
strangers 1
to 1
any 1
species 1
of 1
disunion 1
or 1
dispute 1
Harmony 1
was 1
the 1
soul 1
of 1
our 1
companionship 1
and 1
the 1
diversity 1
and 1
contrast 1
that 1
subsisted 1
in 1
our 1
characters 1
drew 1
us 1
nearer 1
together 1
Elizabeth 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
calmer 1
and 1
more 1
concentrated 1
disposition 1
but 1
with 1
all 1
my 1
ardour 1
I 1
was 1
capable 1
of 1
a 1
more 1
intense 1
application 1
and 1
was 1
more 1
deeply 1
smitten 1
with 1
the 1
thirst 1
for 1
knowledge 1
She 1
busied 1
herself 1
with 1
following 1
the 1
aerial 1
creations 1
of 1
the 1
poets 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
majestic 1
and 1
wondrous 1
scenes 1
which 1
surrounded 1
our 1
Swiss 1
home 1
the 1
sublime 1
shapes 1
of 1
the 1
mountains 1
the 1
changes 1
of 1
the 1
seasons 1
tempest 1
and 1
calm 1
the 1
silence 1
of 1
winter 1
and 1
the 1
life 1
and 1
turbulence 1
of 1
our 1
Alpine 1
summers 1
she 1
found 1
ample 1
scope 1
for 1
admiration 1
and 1
delight 1
While 1
my 1
companion 1
contemplated 1
with 1
a 1
serious 1
and 1
satisfied 1
spirit 1
the 1
magnificent 1
appearances 1
of 1
things 1
I 1
delighted 1
in 1
investigating 1
their 1
causes 1
The 1
world 1
was 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
secret 1
which 1
I 1
desired 1
to 1
divine 1
Curiosity 1
earnest 1
research 1
to 1
learn 1
the 1
hidden 1
laws 1
of 1
nature 1
gladness 1
akin 1
to 1
rapture 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
unfolded 1
to 1
me 1
are 1
among 1
the 1
earliest 1
sensations 1
I 1
can 1
remember 1
On 1
the 1
birth 1
of 1
a 1
second 1
son 1
my 1
junior 1
by 1
seven 1
years 1
my 1
parents 1
gave 1
up 1
entirely 1
their 1
wandering 1
life 1
and 1
fixed 1
themselves 1
in 1
their 1
native 1
country 1
We 1
possessed 1
a 1
house 1
in 1
Geneva 1
and 1
a 1
campagne 1
on 1
Belrive 1
the 1
eastern 1
shore 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
at 1
the 1
distance 1
of 1
rather 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
league 1
from 1
the 1
city 1
We 1
resided 1
principally 1
in 1
the 1
latter 1
and 1
the 1
lives 1
of 1
my 1
parents 1
were 1
passed 1
in 1
considerable 1
seclusion 1
It 1
was 1
my 1
temper 1
to 1
avoid 1
a 1
crowd 1
and 1
to 1
attach 1
myself 1
fervently 1
to 1
a 1
few 1
I 1
was 1
indifferent 1
therefore 1
to 1
my 1
school 1
fellows 1
in 1
general 1
but 1
I 1
united 1
myself 1
in 1
the 1
bonds 1
of 1
the 1
closest 1
friendship 1
to 1
one 1
among 1
them 1
Henry 1
Clerval 1
was 1
the 1
son 1
of 1
a 1
merchant 1
of 1
Geneva 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
boy 1
of 1
singular 1
talent 1
and 1
fancy 1
He 1
loved 1
enterprise 1
hardship 1
and 1
even 1
danger 1
for 1
its 1
own 1
sake 1
He 1
was 1
deeply 1
read 1
in 1
books 1
of 1
chivalry 1
and 1
romance 1
He 1
composed 1
heroic 1
songs 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
write 1
many 1
a 1
tale 1
of 1
enchantment 1
and 1
knightly 1
adventure 1
He 1
tried 1
to 1
make 1
us 1
act 1
plays 1
and 1
to 1
enter 1
into 1
masquerades 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
characters 1
were 1
drawn 1
from 1
the 1
heroes 1
of 1
Roncesvalles 1
of 1
the 1
Round 1
Table 1
of 1
King 1
Arthur 1
and 1
the 1
chivalrous 1
train 1
who 1
shed 1
their 1
blood 1
to 1
redeem 1
the 1
holy 1
sepulchre 1
from 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
the 1
infidels 1
No 1
human 1
being 1
could 1
have 1
passed 1
a 1
happier 1
childhood 1
than 1
myself 1
My 1
parents 1
were 1
possessed 1
by 1
the 1
very 1
spirit 1
of 1
kindness 1
and 1
indulgence 1
We 1
felt 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
the 1
tyrants 1
to 1
rule 1
our 1
lot 1
according 1
to 1
their 1
caprice 1
but 1
the 1
agents 1
and 1
creators 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
many 1
delights 1
which 1
we 1
enjoyed 1
When 1
I 1
mingled 1
with 1
other 1
families 1
I 1
distinctly 1
discerned 1
how 1
peculiarly 1
fortunate 1
my 1
lot 1
was 1
and 1
gratitude 1
assisted 1
the 1
development 1
of 1
filial 1
love 1
My 1
temper 1
was 1
sometimes 1
violent 1
and 1
my 1
passions 1
vehement 1
but 1
by 1
some 1
law 1
in 1
my 1
temperature 1
they 1
were 1
turned 1
not 1
towards 1
childish 1
pursuits 1
but 1
to 1
an 1
eager 1
desire 1
to 1
learn 1
and 1
not 1
to 1
learn 1
all 1
things 1
indiscriminately 1
I 1
confess 1
that 1
neither 1
the 1
structure 1
of 1
languages 1
nor 1
the 1
code 1
of 1
governments 1
nor 1
the 1
politics 1
of 1
various 1
states 1
possessed 1
attractions 1
for 1
me 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
secrets 1
of 1
heaven 1
and 1
earth 1
that 1
I 1
desired 1
to 1
learn 1
and 1
whether 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
outward 1
substance 1
of 1
things 1
or 1
the 1
inner 1
spirit 1
of 1
nature 1
and 1
the 1
mysterious 1
soul 1
of 1
man 1
that 1
occupied 1
me 1
still 1
my 1
inquiries 1
were 1
directed 1
to 1
the 1
metaphysical 1
or 1
in 1
its 1
highest 1
sense 1
the 1
physical 1
secrets 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
Meanwhile 1
Clerval 1
occupied 1
himself 1
so 1
to 1
speak 1
with 1
the 1
moral 1
relations 1
of 1
things 1
The 1
busy 1
stage 1
of 1
life 1
the 1
virtues 1
of 1
heroes 1
and 1
the 1
actions 1
of 1
men 1
were 1
his 1
theme 1
and 1
his 1
hope 1
and 1
his 1
dream 1
was 1
to 1
become 1
one 1
among 1
those 1
whose 1
names 1
are 1
recorded 1
in 1
story 1
as 1
the 1
gallant 1
and 1
adventurous 1
benefactors 1
of 1
our 1
species 1
The 1
saintly 1
soul 1
of 1
Elizabeth 1
shone 1
like 1
a 1
shrine 1
dedicated 1
lamp 1
in 1
our 1
peaceful 1
home 1
Her 1
sympathy 1
was 1
ours 1
her 1
smile 1
her 1
soft 1
voice 1
the 1
sweet 1
glance 1
of 1
her 1
celestial 1
eyes 1
were 1
ever 1
there 1
to 1
bless 1
and 1
animate 1
us 1
She 1
was 1
the 1
living 1
spirit 1
of 1
love 1
to 1
soften 1
and 1
attract 1
I 1
might 1
have 1
become 1
sullen 1
in 1
my 1
study 1
rough 1
through 1
the 1
ardour 1
of 1
my 1
nature 1
but 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
there 1
to 1
subdue 1
me 1
to 1
a 1
semblance 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
gentleness 1
And 1
Clerval 1
could 1
aught 1
ill 1
entrench 1
on 1
the 1
noble 1
spirit 1
of 1
Clerval 1
Yet 1
he 1
might 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
perfectly 1
humane 1
so 1
thoughtful 1
in 1
his 1
generosity 1
so 1
full 1
of 1
kindness 1
and 1
tenderness 1
amidst 1
his 1
passion 1
for 1
adventurous 1
exploit 1
had 1
she 1
not 1
unfolded 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
real 1
loveliness 1
of 1
beneficence 1
and 1
made 1
the 1
doing 1
good 1
the 1
end 1
and 1
aim 1
of 1
his 1
soaring 1
ambition 1
I 1
feel 1
exquisite 1
pleasure 1
in 1
dwelling 1
on 1
the 1
recollections 1
of 1
childhood 1
before 1
misfortune 1
had 1
tainted 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
changed 1
its 1
bright 1
visions 1
of 1
extensive 1
usefulness 1
into 1
gloomy 1
and 1
narrow 1
reflections 1
upon 1
self 1
Besides 1
in 1
drawing 1
the 1
picture 1
of 1
my 1
early 1
days 1
I 1
also 1
record 1
those 1
events 1
which 1
led 1
by 1
insensible 1
steps 1
to 1
my 1
after 1
tale 1
of 1
misery 1
for 1
when 1
I 1
would 1
account 1
to 1
myself 1
for 1
the 1
birth 1
of 1
that 1
passion 1
which 1
afterwards 1
ruled 1
my 1
destiny 1
I 1
find 1
it 1
arise 1
like 1
a 1
mountain 1
river 1
from 1
ignoble 1
and 1
almost 1
forgotten 1
sources 1
but 1
swelling 1
as 1
it 1
proceeded 1
it 1
became 1
the 1
torrent 1
which 1
in 1
its 1
course 1
has 1
swept 1
away 1
all 1
my 1
hopes 1
and 1
joys 1
Natural 1
philosophy 1
is 1
the 1
genius 1
that 1
has 1
regulated 1
my 1
fate 1
I 1
desire 1
therefore 1
in 1
this 1
narration 1
to 1
state 1
those 1
facts 1
which 1
led 1
to 1
my 1
predilection 1
for 1
that 1
science 1
When 1
I 1
was 1
thirteen 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
we 1
all 1
went 1
on 1
a 1
party 1
of 1
pleasure 1
to 1
the 1
baths 1
near 1
Thonon 1
the 1
inclemency 1
of 1
the 1
weather 1
obliged 1
us 1
to 1
remain 1
a 1
day 1
confined 1
to 1
the 1
inn 1
In 1
this 1
house 1
I 1
chanced 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
volume 1
of 1
the 1
works 1
of 1
Cornelius 1
Agrippa 1
I 1
opened 1
it 1
with 1
apathy 1
the 1
theory 1
which 1
he 1
attempts 1
to 1
demonstrate 1
and 1
the 1
wonderful 1
facts 1
which 1
he 1
relates 1
soon 1
changed 1
this 1
feeling 1
into 1
enthusiasm 1
A 1
new 1
light 1
seemed 1
to 1
dawn 1
upon 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
bounding 1
with 1
joy 1
I 1
communicated 1
my 1
discovery 1
to 1
my 1
father 1
My 1
father 1
looked 1
carelessly 1
at 1
the 1
title 1
page 1
of 1
my 1
book 1
and 1
said 1
Ah 1
Cornelius 1
Agrippa 1
My 1
dear 1
Victor 1
do 1
not 1
waste 1
your 1
time 1
upon 1
this 1
it 1
is 1
sad 1
trash 1
If 1
instead 1
of 1
this 1
remark 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
taken 1
the 1
pains 1
to 1
explain 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
principles 1
of 1
Agrippa 1
had 1
been 1
entirely 1
exploded 1
and 1
that 1
a 1
modern 1
system 1
of 1
science 1
had 1
been 1
introduced 1
which 1
possessed 1
much 1
greater 1
powers 1
than 1
the 1
ancient 1
because 1
the 1
powers 1
of 1
the 1
latter 1
were 1
chimerical 1
while 1
those 1
of 1
the 1
former 1
were 1
real 1
and 1
practical 1
under 1
such 1
circumstances 1
I 1
should 1
certainly 1
have 1
thrown 1
Agrippa 1
aside 1
and 1
have 1
contented 1
my 1
imagination 1
warmed 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
by 1
returning 1
with 1
greater 1
ardour 1
to 1
my 1
former 1
studies 1
It 1
is 1
even 1
possible 1
that 1
the 1
train 1
of 1
my 1
ideas 1
would 1
never 1
have 1
received 1
the 1
fatal 1
impulse 1
that 1
led 1
to 1
my 1
ruin 1
But 1
the 1
cursory 1
glance 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
taken 1
of 1
my 1
volume 1
by 1
no 1
means 1
assured 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
acquainted 1
with 1
its 1
contents 1
and 1
I 1
continued 1
to 1
read 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
avidity 1
When 1
I 1
returned 1
home 1
my 1
first 1
care 1
was 1
to 1
procure 1
the 1
whole 1
works 1
of 1
this 1
author 1
and 1
afterwards 1
of 1
Paracelsus 1
and 1
Albertus 1
Magnus 1
I 1
read 1
and 1
studied 1
the 1
wild 1
fancies 1
of 1
these 1
writers 1
with 1
delight 1
they 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
treasures 1
known 1
to 1
few 1
besides 1
myself 1
I 1
have 1
described 1
myself 1
as 1
always 1
having 1
been 1
imbued 1
with 1
a 1
fervent 1
longing 1
to 1
penetrate 1
the 1
secrets 1
of 1
nature 1
In 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
intense 1
labour 1
and 1
wonderful 1
discoveries 1
of 1
modern 1
philosophers 1
I 1
always 1
came 1
from 1
my 1
studies 1
discontented 1
and 1
unsatisfied 1
Sir 1
Isaac 1
Newton 1
is 1
said 1
to 1
have 1
avowed 1
that 1
he 1
felt 1
like 1
a 1
child 1
picking 1
up 1
shells 1
beside 1
the 1
great 1
and 1
unexplored 1
ocean 1
of 1
truth 1
Those 1
of 1
his 1
successors 1
in 1
each 1
branch 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
with 1
whom 1
I 1
was 1
acquainted 1
appeared 1
even 1
to 1
my 1
boy 1
s 1
apprehensions 1
as 1
tyros 1
engaged 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
pursuit 1
The 1
untaught 1
peasant 1
beheld 1
the 1
elements 1
around 1
him 1
and 1
was 1
acquainted 1
with 1
their 1
practical 1
uses 1
The 1
most 1
learned 1
philosopher 1
knew 1
little 1
more 1
He 1
had 1
partially 1
unveiled 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
Nature 1
but 1
her 1
immortal 1
lineaments 1
were 1
still 1
a 1
wonder 1
and 1
a 1
mystery 1
He 1
might 1
dissect 1
anatomize 1
and 1
give 1
names 1
but 1
not 1
to 1
speak 1
of 1
a 1
final 1
cause 1
causes 1
in 1
their 1
secondary 1
and 1
tertiary 1
grades 1
were 1
utterly 1
unknown 1
to 1
him 1
I 1
had 1
gazed 1
upon 1
the 1
fortifications 1
and 1
impediments 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
keep 1
human 1
beings 1
from 1
entering 1
the 1
citadel 1
of 1
nature 1
and 1
rashly 1
and 1
ignorantly 1
I 1
had 1
repined 1
But 1
here 1
were 1
books 1
and 1
here 1
were 1
men 1
who 1
had 1
penetrated 1
deeper 1
and 1
knew 1
more 1
I 1
took 1
their 1
word 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
they 1
averred 1
and 1
I 1
became 1
their 1
disciple 1
It 1
may 1
appear 1
strange 1
that 1
such 1
should 1
arise 1
in 1
the 1
eighteenth 1
century 1
but 1
while 1
I 1
followed 1
the 1
routine 1
of 1
education 1
in 1
the 1
schools 1
of 1
Geneva 1
I 1
was 1
to 1
a 1
great 1
degree 1
self 1
taught 1
with 1
regard 1
to 1
my 1
favourite 1
studies 1
My 1
father 1
was 1
not 1
scientific 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
left 1
to 1
struggle 1
with 1
a 1
child 1
s 1
blindness 1
added 1
to 1
a 1
student 1
s 1
thirst 1
for 1
knowledge 1
Under 1
the 1
guidance 1
of 1
my 1
new 1
preceptors 1
I 1
entered 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
diligence 1
into 1
the 1
search 1
of 1
the 1
philosopher 1
s 1
stone 1
and 1
the 1
elixir 1
of 1
life 1
but 1
the 1
latter 1
soon 1
obtained 1
my 1
undivided 1
attention 1
Wealth 1
was 1
an 1
inferior 1
object 1
but 1
what 1
glory 1
would 1
attend 1
the 1
discovery 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
banish 1
disease 1
from 1
the 1
human 1
frame 1
and 1
render 1
man 1
invulnerable 1
to 1
any 1
but 1
a 1
violent 1
death 1
Nor 1
were 1
these 1
my 1
only 1
visions 1
The 1
raising 1
of 1
ghosts 1
or 1
devils 1
was 1
a 1
promise 1
liberally 1
accorded 1
by 1
my 1
favourite 1
authors 1
the 1
fulfilment 1
of 1
which 1
I 1
most 1
eagerly 1
sought 1
and 1
if 1
my 1
incantations 1
were 1
always 1
unsuccessful 1
I 1
attributed 1
the 1
failure 1
rather 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
inexperience 1
and 1
mistake 1
than 1
to 1
a 1
want 1
of 1
skill 1
or 1
fidelity 1
in 1
my 1
instructors 1
And 1
thus 1
for 1
a 1
time 1
I 1
was 1
occupied 1
by 1
exploded 1
systems 1
mingling 1
like 1
an 1
unadept 1
a 1
thousand 1
contradictory 1
theories 1
and 1
floundering 1
desperately 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
slough 1
of 1
multifarious 1
knowledge 1
guided 1
by 1
an 1
ardent 1
imagination 1
and 1
childish 1
reasoning 1
till 1
an 1
accident 1
again 1
changed 1
the 1
current 1
of 1
my 1
ideas 1
When 1
I 1
was 1
about 1
fifteen 1
years 1
old 1
we 1
had 1
retired 1
to 1
our 1
house 1
near 1
Belrive 1
when 1
we 1
witnessed 1
a 1
most 1
violent 1
and 1
terrible 1
thunderstorm 1
It 1
advanced 1
from 1
behind 1
the 1
mountains 1
of 1
Jura 1
and 1
the 1
thunder 1
burst 1
at 1
once 1
with 1
frightful 1
loudness 1
from 1
various 1
quarters 1
of 1
the 1
heavens 1
I 1
remained 1
while 1
the 1
storm 1
lasted 1
watching 1
its 1
progress 1
with 1
curiosity 1
and 1
delight 1
As 1
I 1
stood 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
on 1
a 1
sudden 1
I 1
beheld 1
a 1
stream 1
of 1
fire 1
issue 1
from 1
an 1
old 1
and 1
beautiful 1
oak 1
which 1
stood 1
about 1
twenty 1
yards 1
from 1
our 1
house 1
and 1
so 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
dazzling 1
light 1
vanished 1
the 1
oak 1
had 1
disappeared 1
and 1
nothing 1
remained 1
but 1
a 1
blasted 1
stump 1
When 1
we 1
visited 1
it 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
we 1
found 1
the 1
tree 1
shattered 1
in 1
a 1
singular 1
manner 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
splintered 1
by 1
the 1
shock 1
but 1
entirely 1
reduced 1
to 1
thin 1
ribbons 1
of 1
wood 1
I 1
never 1
beheld 1
anything 1
so 1
utterly 1
destroyed 1
Before 1
this 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
unacquainted 1
with 1
the 1
more 1
obvious 1
laws 1
of 1
electricity 1
On 1
this 1
occasion 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
great 1
research 1
in 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
was 1
with 1
us 1
and 1
excited 1
by 1
this 1
catastrophe 1
he 1
entered 1
on 1
the 1
explanation 1
of 1
a 1
theory 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
formed 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
of 1
electricity 1
and 1
galvanism 1
which 1
was 1
at 1
once 1
new 1
and 1
astonishing 1
to 1
me 1
All 1
that 1
he 1
said 1
threw 1
greatly 1
into 1
the 1
shade 1
Cornelius 1
Agrippa 1
Albertus 1
Magnus 1
and 1
Paracelsus 1
the 1
lords 1
of 1
my 1
imagination 1
but 1
by 1
some 1
fatality 1
the 1
overthrow 1
of 1
these 1
men 1
disinclined 1
me 1
to 1
pursue 1
my 1
accustomed 1
studies 1
It 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
if 1
nothing 1
would 1
or 1
could 1
ever 1
be 1
known 1
All 1
that 1
had 1
so 1
long 1
engaged 1
my 1
attention 1
suddenly 1
grew 1
despicable 1
By 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
caprices 1
of 1
the 1
mind 1
which 1
we 1
are 1
perhaps 1
most 1
subject 1
to 1
in 1
early 1
youth 1
I 1
at 1
once 1
gave 1
up 1
my 1
former 1
occupations 1
set 1
down 1
natural 1
history 1
and 1
all 1
its 1
progeny 1
as 1
a 1
deformed 1
and 1
abortive 1
creation 1
and 1
entertained 1
the 1
greatest 1
disdain 1
for 1
a 1
would 1
be 1
science 1
which 1
could 1
never 1
even 1
step 1
within 1
the 1
threshold 1
of 1
real 1
knowledge 1
In 1
this 1
mood 1
of 1
mind 1
I 1
betook 1
myself 1
to 1
the 1
mathematics 1
and 1
the 1
branches 1
of 1
study 1
appertaining 1
to 1
that 1
science 1
as 1
being 1
built 1
upon 1
secure 1
foundations 1
and 1
so 1
worthy 1
of 1
my 1
consideration 1
Thus 1
strangely 1
are 1
our 1
souls 1
constructed 1
and 1
by 1
such 1
slight 1
ligaments 1
are 1
we 1
bound 1
to 1
prosperity 1
or 1
ruin 1
When 1
I 1
look 1
back 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
if 1
this 1
almost 1
miraculous 1
change 1
of 1
inclination 1
and 1
will 1
was 1
the 1
immediate 1
suggestion 1
of 1
the 1
guardian 1
angel 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
the 1
last 1
effort 1
made 1
by 1
the 1
spirit 1
of 1
preservation 1
to 1
avert 1
the 1
storm 1
that 1
was 1
even 1
then 1
hanging 1
in 1
the 1
stars 1
and 1
ready 1
to 1
envelop 1
me 1
Her 1
victory 1
was 1
announced 1
by 1
an 1
unusual 1
tranquillity 1
and 1
gladness 1
of 1
soul 1
which 1
followed 1
the 1
relinquishing 1
of 1
my 1
ancient 1
and 1
latterly 1
tormenting 1
studies 1
It 1
was 1
thus 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
taught 1
to 1
associate 1
evil 1
with 1
their 1
prosecution 1
happiness 1
with 1
their 1
disregard 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
strong 1
effort 1
of 1
the 1
spirit 1
of 1
good 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
ineffectual 1
Destiny 1
was 1
too 1
potent 1
and 1
her 1
immutable 1
laws 1
had 1
decreed 1
my 1
utter 1
and 1
terrible 1
destruction 1
Chapter 1
When 1
I 1
had 1
attained 1
the 1
age 1
of 1
seventeen 1
my 1
parents 1
resolved 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
become 1
a 1
student 1
at 1
the 1
university 1
of 1
Ingolstadt 1
I 1
had 1
hitherto 1
attended 1
the 1
schools 1
of 1
Geneva 1
but 1
my 1
father 1
thought 1
it 1
necessary 1
for 1
the 1
completion 1
of 1
my 1
education 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
made 1
acquainted 1
with 1
other 1
customs 1
than 1
those 1
of 1
my 1
native 1
country 1
My 1
departure 1
was 1
therefore 1
fixed 1
at 1
an 1
early 1
date 1
but 1
before 1
the 1
day 1
resolved 1
upon 1
could 1
arrive 1
the 1
first 1
misfortune 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
occurred 1
an 1
omen 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
of 1
my 1
future 1
misery 1
Elizabeth 1
had 1
caught 1
the 1
scarlet 1
fever 1
her 1
illness 1
was 1
severe 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
greatest 1
danger 1
During 1
her 1
illness 1
many 1
arguments 1
had 1
been 1
urged 1
to 1
persuade 1
my 1
mother 1
to 1
refrain 1
from 1
attending 1
upon 1
her 1
She 1
had 1
at 1
first 1
yielded 1
to 1
our 1
entreaties 1
but 1
when 1
she 1
heard 1
that 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
her 1
favourite 1
was 1
menaced 1
she 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
control 1
her 1
anxiety 1
She 1
attended 1
her 1
sickbed 1
her 1
watchful 1
attentions 1
triumphed 1
over 1
the 1
malignity 1
of 1
the 1
distemper 1
Elizabeth 1
was 1
saved 1
but 1
the 1
consequences 1
of 1
this 1
imprudence 1
were 1
fatal 1
to 1
her 1
preserver 1
On 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
my 1
mother 1
sickened 1
her 1
fever 1
was 1
accompanied 1
by 1
the 1
most 1
alarming 1
symptoms 1
and 1
the 1
looks 1
of 1
her 1
medical 1
attendants 1
prognosticated 1
the 1
worst 1
event 1
On 1
her 1
deathbed 1
the 1
fortitude 1
and 1
benignity 1
of 1
this 1
best 1
of 1
women 1
did 1
not 1
desert 1
her 1
She 1
joined 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
Elizabeth 1
and 1
myself 1
My 1
children 1
she 1
said 1
my 1
firmest 1
hopes 1
of 1
future 1
happiness 1
were 1
placed 1
on 1
the 1
prospect 1
of 1
your 1
union 1
This 1
expectation 1
will 1
now 1
be 1
the 1
consolation 1
of 1
your 1
father 1
Elizabeth 1
my 1
love 1
you 1
must 1
supply 1
my 1
place 1
to 1
my 1
younger 1
children 1
Alas 1
I 1
regret 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
taken 1
from 1
you 1
and 1
happy 1
and 1
beloved 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
hard 1
to 1
quit 1
you 1
all 1
But 1
these 1
are 1
not 1
thoughts 1
befitting 1
me 1
I 1
will 1
endeavour 1
to 1
resign 1
myself 1
cheerfully 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
will 1
indulge 1
a 1
hope 1
of 1
meeting 1
you 1
in 1
another 1
world 1
She 1
died 1
calmly 1
and 1
her 1
countenance 1
expressed 1
affection 1
even 1
in 1
death 1
I 1
need 1
not 1
describe 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
those 1
whose 1
dearest 1
ties 1
are 1
rent 1
by 1
that 1
most 1
irreparable 1
evil 1
the 1
void 1
that 1
presents 1
itself 1
to 1
the 1
soul 1
and 1
the 1
despair 1
that 1
is 1
exhibited 1
on 1
the 1
countenance 1
It 1
is 1
so 1
long 1
before 1
the 1
mind 1
can 1
persuade 1
itself 1
that 1
she 1
whom 1
we 1
saw 1
every 1
day 1
and 1
whose 1
very 1
existence 1
appeared 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
our 1
own 1
can 1
have 1
departed 1
forever 1
that 1
the 1
brightness 1
of 1
a 1
beloved 1
eye 1
can 1
have 1
been 1
extinguished 1
and 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
a 1
voice 1
so 1
familiar 1
and 1
dear 1
to 1
the 1
ear 1
can 1
be 1
hushed 1
never 1
more 1
to 1
be 1
heard 1
These 1
are 1
the 1
reflections 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
days 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
lapse 1
of 1
time 1
proves 1
the 1
reality 1
of 1
the 1
evil 1
then 1
the 1
actual 1
bitterness 1
of 1
grief 1
commences 1
Yet 1
from 1
whom 1
has 1
not 1
that 1
rude 1
hand 1
rent 1
away 1
some 1
dear 1
connection 1
And 1
why 1
should 1
I 1
describe 1
a 1
sorrow 1
which 1
all 1
have 1
felt 1
and 1
must 1
feel 1
The 1
time 1
at 1
length 1
arrives 1
when 1
grief 1
is 1
rather 1
an 1
indulgence 1
than 1
a 1
necessity 1
and 1
the 1
smile 1
that 1
plays 1
upon 1
the 1
lips 1
although 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
deemed 1
a 1
sacrilege 1
is 1
not 1
banished 1
My 1
mother 1
was 1
dead 1
but 1
we 1
had 1
still 1
duties 1
which 1
we 1
ought 1
to 1
perform 1
we 1
must 1
continue 1
our 1
course 1
with 1
the 1
rest 1
and 1
learn 1
to 1
think 1
ourselves 1
fortunate 1
whilst 1
one 1
remains 1
whom 1
the 1
spoiler 1
has 1
not 1
seized 1
My 1
departure 1
for 1
Ingolstadt 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
deferred 1
by 1
these 1
events 1
was 1
now 1
again 1
determined 1
upon 1
I 1
obtained 1
from 1
my 1
father 1
a 1
respite 1
of 1
some 1
weeks 1
It 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
sacrilege 1
so 1
soon 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
repose 1
akin 1
to 1
death 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
mourning 1
and 1
to 1
rush 1
into 1
the 1
thick 1
of 1
life 1
I 1
was 1
new 1
to 1
sorrow 1
but 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
the 1
less 1
alarm 1
me 1
I 1
was 1
unwilling 1
to 1
quit 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
those 1
that 1
remained 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
above 1
all 1
I 1
desired 1
to 1
see 1
my 1
sweet 1
Elizabeth 1
in 1
some 1
degree 1
consoled 1
She 1
indeed 1
veiled 1
her 1
grief 1
and 1
strove 1
to 1
act 1
the 1
comforter 1
to 1
us 1
all 1
She 1
looked 1
steadily 1
on 1
life 1
and 1
assumed 1
its 1
duties 1
with 1
courage 1
and 1
zeal 1
She 1
devoted 1
herself 1
to 1
those 1
whom 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
taught 1
to 1
call 1
her 1
uncle 1
and 1
cousins 1
Never 1
was 1
she 1
so 1
enchanting 1
as 1
at 1
this 1
time 1
when 1
she 1
recalled 1
the 1
sunshine 1
of 1
her 1
smiles 1
and 1
spent 1
them 1
upon 1
us 1
She 1
forgot 1
even 1
her 1
own 1
regret 1
in 1
her 1
endeavours 1
to 1
make 1
us 1
forget 1
The 1
day 1
of 1
my 1
departure 1
at 1
length 1
arrived 1
Clerval 1
spent 1
the 1
last 1
evening 1
with 1
us 1
He 1
had 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
persuade 1
his 1
father 1
to 1
permit 1
him 1
to 1
accompany 1
me 1
and 1
to 1
become 1
my 1
fellow 1
student 1
but 1
in 1
vain 1
His 1
father 1
was 1
a 1
narrow 1
minded 1
trader 1
and 1
saw 1
idleness 1
and 1
ruin 1
in 1
the 1
aspirations 1
and 1
ambition 1
of 1
his 1
son 1
Henry 1
deeply 1
felt 1
the 1
misfortune 1
of 1
being 1
debarred 1
from 1
a 1
liberal 1
education 1
He 1
said 1
little 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
spoke 1
I 1
read 1
in 1
his 1
kindling 1
eye 1
and 1
in 1
his 1
animated 1
glance 1
a 1
restrained 1
but 1
firm 1
resolve 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
chained 1
to 1
the 1
miserable 1
details 1
of 1
commerce 1
We 1
sat 1
late 1
We 1
could 1
not 1
tear 1
ourselves 1
away 1
from 1
each 1
other 1
nor 1
persuade 1
ourselves 1
to 1
say 1
the 1
word 1
Farewell 1
It 1
was 1
said 1
and 1
we 1
retired 1
under 1
the 1
pretence 1
of 1
seeking 1
repose 1
each 1
fancying 1
that 1
the 1
other 1
was 1
deceived 1
but 1
when 1
at 1
morning 1
s 1
dawn 1
I 1
descended 1
to 1
the 1
carriage 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
convey 1
me 1
away 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
there 1
my 1
father 1
again 1
to 1
bless 1
me 1
Clerval 1
to 1
press 1
my 1
hand 1
once 1
more 1
my 1
Elizabeth 1
to 1
renew 1
her 1
entreaties 1
that 1
I 1
would 1
write 1
often 1
and 1
to 1
bestow 1
the 1
last 1
feminine 1
attentions 1
on 1
her 1
playmate 1
and 1
friend 1
I 1
threw 1
myself 1
into 1
the 1
chaise 1
that 1
was 1
to 1
convey 1
me 1
away 1
and 1
indulged 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
melancholy 1
reflections 1
I 1
who 1
had 1
ever 1
been 1
surrounded 1
by 1
amiable 1
companions 1
continually 1
engaged 1
in 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
bestow 1
mutual 1
pleasure 1
I 1
was 1
now 1
alone 1
In 1
the 1
university 1
whither 1
I 1
was 1
going 1
I 1
must 1
form 1
my 1
own 1
friends 1
and 1
be 1
my 1
own 1
protector 1
My 1
life 1
had 1
hitherto 1
been 1
remarkably 1
secluded 1
and 1
domestic 1
and 1
this 1
had 1
given 1
me 1
invincible 1
repugnance 1
to 1
new 1
countenances 1
I 1
loved 1
my 1
brothers 1
Elizabeth 1
and 1
Clerval 1
these 1
were 1
old 1
familiar 1
faces 1
but 1
I 1
believed 1
myself 1
totally 1
unfitted 1
for 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
strangers 1
Such 1
were 1
my 1
reflections 1
as 1
I 1
commenced 1
my 1
journey 1
but 1
as 1
I 1
proceeded 1
my 1
spirits 1
and 1
hopes 1
rose 1
I 1
ardently 1
desired 1
the 1
acquisition 1
of 1
knowledge 1
I 1
had 1
often 1
when 1
at 1
home 1
thought 1
it 1
hard 1
to 1
remain 1
during 1
my 1
youth 1
cooped 1
up 1
in 1
one 1
place 1
and 1
had 1
longed 1
to 1
enter 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
take 1
my 1
station 1
among 1
other 1
human 1
beings 1
Now 1
my 1
desires 1
were 1
complied 1
with 1
and 1
it 1
would 1
indeed 1
have 1
been 1
folly 1
to 1
repent 1
I 1
had 1
sufficient 1
leisure 1
for 1
these 1
and 1
many 1
other 1
reflections 1
during 1
my 1
journey 1
to 1
Ingolstadt 1
which 1
was 1
long 1
and 1
fatiguing 1
At 1
length 1
the 1
high 1
white 1
steeple 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
met 1
my 1
eyes 1
I 1
alighted 1
and 1
was 1
conducted 1
to 1
my 1
solitary 1
apartment 1
to 1
spend 1
the 1
evening 1
as 1
I 1
pleased 1
The 1
next 1
morning 1
I 1
delivered 1
my 1
letters 1
of 1
introduction 1
and 1
paid 1
a 1
visit 1
to 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
principal 1
professors 1
Chance 1
or 1
rather 1
the 1
evil 1
influence 1
the 1
Angel 1
of 1
Destruction 1
which 1
asserted 1
omnipotent 1
sway 1
over 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
moment 1
I 1
turned 1
my 1
reluctant 1
steps 1
from 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
door 1
led 1
me 1
first 1
to 1
M 1
Krempe 1
professor 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
He 1
was 1
an 1
uncouth 1
man 1
but 1
deeply 1
imbued 1
in 1
the 1
secrets 1
of 1
his 1
science 1
He 1
asked 1
me 1
several 1
questions 1
concerning 1
my 1
progress 1
in 1
the 1
different 1
branches 1
of 1
science 1
appertaining 1
to 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
I 1
replied 1
carelessly 1
and 1
partly 1
in 1
contempt 1
mentioned 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
my 1
alchemists 1
as 1
the 1
principal 1
authors 1
I 1
had 1
studied 1
The 1
professor 1
stared 1
Have 1
you 1
he 1
said 1
really 1
spent 1
your 1
time 1
in 1
studying 1
such 1
nonsense 1
I 1
replied 1
in 1
the 1
affirmative 1
Every 1
minute 1
continued 1
M 1
Krempe 1
with 1
warmth 1
every 1
instant 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
wasted 1
on 1
those 1
books 1
is 1
utterly 1
and 1
entirely 1
lost 1
You 1
have 1
burdened 1
your 1
memory 1
with 1
exploded 1
systems 1
and 1
useless 1
names 1
Good 1
God 1
In 1
what 1
desert 1
land 1
have 1
you 1
lived 1
where 1
no 1
one 1
was 1
kind 1
enough 1
to 1
inform 1
you 1
that 1
these 1
fancies 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
so 1
greedily 1
imbibed 1
are 1
a 1
thousand 1
years 1
old 1
and 1
as 1
musty 1
as 1
they 1
are 1
ancient 1
I 1
little 1
expected 1
in 1
this 1
enlightened 1
and 1
scientific 1
age 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
disciple 1
of 1
Albertus 1
Magnus 1
and 1
Paracelsus 1
My 1
dear 1
sir 1
you 1
must 1
begin 1
your 1
studies 1
entirely 1
anew 1
So 1
saying 1
he 1
stepped 1
aside 1
and 1
wrote 1
down 1
a 1
list 1
of 1
several 1
books 1
treating 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
which 1
he 1
desired 1
me 1
to 1
procure 1
and 1
dismissed 1
me 1
after 1
mentioning 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
the 1
following 1
week 1
he 1
intended 1
to 1
commence 1
a 1
course 1
of 1
lectures 1
upon 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
in 1
its 1
general 1
relations 1
and 1
that 1
M 1
Waldman 1
a 1
fellow 1
professor 1
would 1
lecture 1
upon 1
chemistry 1
the 1
alternate 1
days 1
that 1
he 1
omitted 1
I 1
returned 1
home 1
not 1
disappointed 1
for 1
I 1
have 1
said 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
long 1
considered 1
those 1
authors 1
useless 1
whom 1
the 1
professor 1
reprobated 1
but 1
I 1
returned 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
the 1
more 1
inclined 1
to 1
recur 1
to 1
these 1
studies 1
in 1
any 1
shape 1
M 1
Krempe 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
squat 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
gruff 1
voice 1
and 1
a 1
repulsive 1
countenance 1
the 1
teacher 1
therefore 1
did 1
not 1
prepossess 1
me 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
his 1
pursuits 1
In 1
rather 1
a 1
too 1
philosophical 1
and 1
connected 1
a 1
strain 1
perhaps 1
I 1
have 1
given 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
conclusions 1
I 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
concerning 1
them 1
in 1
my 1
early 1
years 1
As 1
a 1
child 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
content 1
with 1
the 1
results 1
promised 1
by 1
the 1
modern 1
professors 1
of 1
natural 1
science 1
With 1
a 1
confusion 1
of 1
ideas 1
only 1
to 1
be 1
accounted 1
for 1
by 1
my 1
extreme 1
youth 1
and 1
my 1
want 1
of 1
a 1
guide 1
on 1
such 1
matters 1
I 1
had 1
retrod 1
the 1
steps 1
of 1
knowledge 1
along 1
the 1
paths 1
of 1
time 1
and 1
exchanged 1
the 1
discoveries 1
of 1
recent 1
inquirers 1
for 1
the 1
dreams 1
of 1
forgotten 1
alchemists 1
Besides 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
contempt 1
for 1
the 1
uses 1
of 1
modern 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
It 1
was 1
very 1
different 1
when 1
the 1
masters 1
of 1
the 1
science 1
sought 1
immortality 1
and 1
power 1
such 1
views 1
although 1
futile 1
were 1
grand 1
but 1
now 1
the 1
scene 1
was 1
changed 1
The 1
ambition 1
of 1
the 1
inquirer 1
seemed 1
to 1
limit 1
itself 1
to 1
the 1
annihilation 1
of 1
those 1
visions 1
on 1
which 1
my 1
interest 1
in 1
science 1
was 1
chiefly 1
founded 1
I 1
was 1
required 1
to 1
exchange 1
chimeras 1
of 1
boundless 1
grandeur 1
for 1
realities 1
of 1
little 1
worth 1
Such 1
were 1
my 1
reflections 1
during 1
the 1
first 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
days 1
of 1
my 1
residence 1
at 1
Ingolstadt 1
which 1
were 1
chiefly 1
spent 1
in 1
becoming 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
localities 1
and 1
the 1
principal 1
residents 1
in 1
my 1
new 1
abode 1
But 1
as 1
the 1
ensuing 1
week 1
commenced 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
information 1
which 1
M 1
Krempe 1
had 1
given 1
me 1
concerning 1
the 1
lectures 1
And 1
although 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
consent 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
hear 1
that 1
little 1
conceited 1
fellow 1
deliver 1
sentences 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
pulpit 1
I 1
recollected 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
said 1
of 1
M 1
Waldman 1
whom 1
I 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
hitherto 1
been 1
out 1
of 1
town 1
Partly 1
from 1
curiosity 1
and 1
partly 1
from 1
idleness 1
I 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
lecturing 1
room 1
which 1
M 1
Waldman 1
entered 1
shortly 1
after 1
This 1
professor 1
was 1
very 1
unlike 1
his 1
colleague 1
He 1
appeared 1
about 1
fifty 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
but 1
with 1
an 1
aspect 1
expressive 1
of 1
the 1
greatest 1
benevolence 1
a 1
few 1
grey 1
hairs 1
covered 1
his 1
temples 1
but 1
those 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
his 1
head 1
were 1
nearly 1
black 1
His 1
person 1
was 1
short 1
but 1
remarkably 1
erect 1
and 1
his 1
voice 1
the 1
sweetest 1
I 1
had 1
ever 1
heard 1
He 1
began 1
his 1
lecture 1
by 1
a 1
recapitulation 1
of 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
chemistry 1
and 1
the 1
various 1
improvements 1
made 1
by 1
different 1
men 1
of 1
learning 1
pronouncing 1
with 1
fervour 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
distinguished 1
discoverers 1
He 1
then 1
took 1
a 1
cursory 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
present 1
state 1
of 1
the 1
science 1
and 1
explained 1
many 1
of 1
its 1
elementary 1
terms 1
After 1
having 1
made 1
a 1
few 1
preparatory 1
experiments 1
he 1
concluded 1
with 1
a 1
panegyric 1
upon 1
modern 1
chemistry 1
the 1
terms 1
of 1
which 1
I 1
shall 1
never 1
forget 1
The 1
ancient 1
teachers 1
of 1
this 1
science 1
said 1
he 1
promised 1
impossibilities 1
and 1
performed 1
nothing 1
The 1
modern 1
masters 1
promise 1
very 1
little 1
they 1
know 1
that 1
metals 1
cannot 1
be 1
transmuted 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
elixir 1
of 1
life 1
is 1
a 1
chimera 1
but 1
these 1
philosophers 1
whose 1
hands 1
seem 1
only 1
made 1
to 1
dabble 1
in 1
dirt 1
and 1
their 1
eyes 1
to 1
pore 1
over 1
the 1
microscope 1
or 1
crucible 1
have 1
indeed 1
performed 1
miracles 1
They 1
penetrate 1
into 1
the 1
recesses 1
of 1
nature 1
and 1
show 1
how 1
she 1
works 1
in 1
her 1
hiding 1
places 1
They 1
ascend 1
into 1
the 1
heavens 1
they 1
have 1
discovered 1
how 1
the 1
blood 1
circulates 1
and 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
air 1
we 1
breathe 1
They 1
have 1
acquired 1
new 1
and 1
almost 1
unlimited 1
powers 1
they 1
can 1
command 1
the 1
thunders 1
of 1
heaven 1
mimic 1
the 1
earthquake 1
and 1
even 1
mock 1
the 1
invisible 1
world 1
with 1
its 1
own 1
shadows 1
Such 1
were 1
the 1
professor 1
s 1
words 1
rather 1
let 1
me 1
say 1
such 1
the 1
words 1
of 1
the 1
fate 1
enounced 1
to 1
destroy 1
me 1
As 1
he 1
went 1
on 1
I 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
my 1
soul 1
were 1
grappling 1
with 1
a 1
palpable 1
enemy 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
the 1
various 1
keys 1
were 1
touched 1
which 1
formed 1
the 1
mechanism 1
of 1
my 1
being 1
chord 1
after 1
chord 1
was 1
sounded 1
and 1
soon 1
my 1
mind 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
one 1
thought 1
one 1
conception 1
one 1
purpose 1
So 1
much 1
has 1
been 1
done 1
exclaimed 1
the 1
soul 1
of 1
Frankenstein 1
more 1
far 1
more 1
will 1
I 1
achieve 1
treading 1
in 1
the 1
steps 1
already 1
marked 1
I 1
will 1
pioneer 1
a 1
new 1
way 1
explore 1
unknown 1
powers 1
and 1
unfold 1
to 1
the 1
world 1
the 1
deepest 1
mysteries 1
of 1
creation 1
I 1
closed 1
not 1
my 1
eyes 1
that 1
night 1
My 1
internal 1
being 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
insurrection 1
and 1
turmoil 1
I 1
felt 1
that 1
order 1
would 1
thence 1
arise 1
but 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
power 1
to 1
produce 1
it 1
By 1
degrees 1
after 1
the 1
morning 1
s 1
dawn 1
sleep 1
came 1
I 1
awoke 1
and 1
my 1
yesternight 1
s 1
thoughts 1
were 1
as 1
a 1
dream 1
There 1
only 1
remained 1
a 1
resolution 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
my 1
ancient 1
studies 1
and 1
to 1
devote 1
myself 1
to 1
a 1
science 1
for 1
which 1
I 1
believed 1
myself 1
to 1
possess 1
a 1
natural 1
talent 1
On 1
the 1
same 1
day 1
I 1
paid 1
M 1
Waldman 1
a 1
visit 1
His 1
manners 1
in 1
private 1
were 1
even 1
more 1
mild 1
and 1
attractive 1
than 1
in 1
public 1
for 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
certain 1
dignity 1
in 1
his 1
mien 1
during 1
his 1
lecture 1
which 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
house 1
was 1
replaced 1
by 1
the 1
greatest 1
affability 1
and 1
kindness 1
I 1
gave 1
him 1
pretty 1
nearly 1
the 1
same 1
account 1
of 1
my 1
former 1
pursuits 1
as 1
I 1
had 1
given 1
to 1
his 1
fellow 1
professor 1
He 1
heard 1
with 1
attention 1
the 1
little 1
narration 1
concerning 1
my 1
studies 1
and 1
smiled 1
at 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
Cornelius 1
Agrippa 1
and 1
Paracelsus 1
but 1
without 1
the 1
contempt 1
that 1
M 1
Krempe 1
had 1
exhibited 1
He 1
said 1
that 1
These 1
were 1
men 1
to 1
whose 1
indefatigable 1
zeal 1
modern 1
philosophers 1
were 1
indebted 1
for 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
foundations 1
of 1
their 1
knowledge 1
They 1
had 1
left 1
to 1
us 1
as 1
an 1
easier 1
task 1
to 1
give 1
new 1
names 1
and 1
arrange 1
in 1
connected 1
classifications 1
the 1
facts 1
which 1
they 1
in 1
a 1
great 1
degree 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
instruments 1
of 1
bringing 1
to 1
light 1
The 1
labours 1
of 1
men 1
of 1
genius 1
however 1
erroneously 1
directed 1
scarcely 1
ever 1
fail 1
in 1
ultimately 1
turning 1
to 1
the 1
solid 1
advantage 1
of 1
mankind 1
I 1
listened 1
to 1
his 1
statement 1
which 1
was 1
delivered 1
without 1
any 1
presumption 1
or 1
affectation 1
and 1
then 1
added 1
that 1
his 1
lecture 1
had 1
removed 1
my 1
prejudices 1
against 1
modern 1
chemists 1
I 1
expressed 1
myself 1
in 1
measured 1
terms 1
with 1
the 1
modesty 1
and 1
deference 1
due 1
from 1
a 1
youth 1
to 1
his 1
instructor 1
without 1
letting 1
escape 1
inexperience 1
in 1
life 1
would 1
have 1
made 1
me 1
ashamed 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
enthusiasm 1
which 1
stimulated 1
my 1
intended 1
labours 1
I 1
requested 1
his 1
advice 1
concerning 1
the 1
books 1
I 1
ought 1
to 1
procure 1
I 1
am 1
happy 1
said 1
M 1
Waldman 1
to 1
have 1
gained 1
a 1
disciple 1
and 1
if 1
your 1
application 1
equals 1
your 1
ability 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
of 1
your 1
success 1
Chemistry 1
is 1
that 1
branch 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
greatest 1
improvements 1
have 1
been 1
and 1
may 1
be 1
made 1
it 1
is 1
on 1
that 1
account 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
made 1
it 1
my 1
peculiar 1
study 1
but 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
neglected 1
the 1
other 1
branches 1
of 1
science 1
A 1
man 1
would 1
make 1
but 1
a 1
very 1
sorry 1
chemist 1
if 1
he 1
attended 1
to 1
that 1
department 1
of 1
human 1
knowledge 1
alone 1
If 1
your 1
wish 1
is 1
to 1
become 1
really 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
science 1
and 1
not 1
merely 1
a 1
petty 1
experimentalist 1
I 1
should 1
advise 1
you 1
to 1
apply 1
to 1
every 1
branch 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
including 1
mathematics 1
He 1
then 1
took 1
me 1
into 1
his 1
laboratory 1
and 1
explained 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
uses 1
of 1
his 1
various 1
machines 1
instructing 1
me 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
I 1
ought 1
to 1
procure 1
and 1
promising 1
me 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
when 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
advanced 1
far 1
enough 1
in 1
the 1
science 1
not 1
to 1
derange 1
their 1
mechanism 1
He 1
also 1
gave 1
me 1
the 1
list 1
of 1
books 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
requested 1
and 1
I 1
took 1
my 1
leave 1
Thus 1
ended 1
a 1
day 1
memorable 1
to 1
me 1
it 1
decided 1
my 1
future 1
destiny 1
Chapter 1
From 1
this 1
day 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
and 1
particularly 1
chemistry 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
comprehensive 1
sense 1
of 1
the 1
term 1
became 1
nearly 1
my 1
sole 1
occupation 1
I 1
read 1
with 1
ardour 1
those 1
works 1
so 1
full 1
of 1
genius 1
and 1
discrimination 1
which 1
modern 1
inquirers 1
have 1
written 1
on 1
these 1
subjects 1
I 1
attended 1
the 1
lectures 1
and 1
cultivated 1
the 1
acquaintance 1
of 1
the 1
men 1
of 1
science 1
of 1
the 1
university 1
and 1
I 1
found 1
even 1
in 1
M 1
Krempe 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
sound 1
sense 1
and 1
real 1
information 1
combined 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
with 1
a 1
repulsive 1
physiognomy 1
and 1
manners 1
but 1
not 1
on 1
that 1
account 1
the 1
less 1
valuable 1
In 1
M 1
Waldman 1
I 1
found 1
a 1
true 1
friend 1
His 1
gentleness 1
was 1
never 1
tinged 1
by 1
dogmatism 1
and 1
his 1
instructions 1
were 1
given 1
with 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
frankness 1
and 1
good 1
nature 1
that 1
banished 1
every 1
idea 1
of 1
pedantry 1
In 1
a 1
thousand 1
ways 1
he 1
smoothed 1
for 1
me 1
the 1
path 1
of 1
knowledge 1
and 1
made 1
the 1
most 1
abstruse 1
inquiries 1
clear 1
and 1
facile 1
to 1
my 1
apprehension 1
My 1
application 1
was 1
at 1
first 1
fluctuating 1
and 1
uncertain 1
it 1
gained 1
strength 1
as 1
I 1
proceeded 1
and 1
soon 1
became 1
so 1
ardent 1
and 1
eager 1
that 1
the 1
stars 1
often 1
disappeared 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
morning 1
whilst 1
I 1
was 1
yet 1
engaged 1
in 1
my 1
laboratory 1
As 1
I 1
applied 1
so 1
closely 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
easily 1
conceived 1
that 1
my 1
progress 1
was 1
rapid 1
My 1
ardour 1
was 1
indeed 1
the 1
astonishment 1
of 1
the 1
students 1
and 1
my 1
proficiency 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
masters 1
Professor 1
Krempe 1
often 1
asked 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
sly 1
smile 1
how 1
Cornelius 1
Agrippa 1
went 1
on 1
whilst 1
M 1
Waldman 1
expressed 1
the 1
most 1
heartfelt 1
exultation 1
in 1
my 1
progress 1
Two 1
years 1
passed 1
in 1
this 1
manner 1
during 1
which 1
I 1
paid 1
no 1
visit 1
to 1
Geneva 1
but 1
was 1
engaged 1
heart 1
and 1
soul 1
in 1
the 1
pursuit 1
of 1
some 1
discoveries 1
which 1
I 1
hoped 1
to 1
make 1
None 1
but 1
those 1
who 1
have 1
experienced 1
them 1
can 1
conceive 1
of 1
the 1
enticements 1
of 1
science 1
In 1
other 1
studies 1
you 1
go 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
others 1
have 1
gone 1
before 1
you 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
more 1
to 1
know 1
but 1
in 1
a 1
scientific 1
pursuit 1
there 1
is 1
continual 1
food 1
for 1
discovery 1
and 1
wonder 1
A 1
mind 1
of 1
moderate 1
capacity 1
which 1
closely 1
pursues 1
one 1
study 1
must 1
infallibly 1
arrive 1
at 1
great 1
proficiency 1
in 1
that 1
study 1
and 1
I 1
who 1
continually 1
sought 1
the 1
attainment 1
of 1
one 1
object 1
of 1
pursuit 1
and 1
was 1
solely 1
wrapped 1
up 1
in 1
this 1
improved 1
so 1
rapidly 1
that 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
two 1
years 1
I 1
made 1
some 1
discoveries 1
in 1
the 1
improvement 1
of 1
some 1
chemical 1
instruments 1
which 1
procured 1
me 1
great 1
esteem 1
and 1
admiration 1
at 1
the 1
university 1
When 1
I 1
had 1
arrived 1
at 1
this 1
point 1
and 1
had 1
become 1
as 1
well 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
theory 1
and 1
practice 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
as 1
depended 1
on 1
the 1
lessons 1
of 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
professors 1
at 1
Ingolstadt 1
my 1
residence 1
there 1
being 1
no 1
longer 1
conducive 1
to 1
my 1
improvements 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
returning 1
to 1
my 1
friends 1
and 1
my 1
native 1
town 1
when 1
an 1
incident 1
happened 1
that 1
protracted 1
my 1
stay 1
One 1
of 1
the 1
phenomena 1
which 1
had 1
peculiarly 1
attracted 1
my 1
attention 1
was 1
the 1
structure 1
of 1
the 1
human 1
frame 1
and 1
indeed 1
any 1
animal 1
endued 1
with 1
life 1
Whence 1
I 1
often 1
asked 1
myself 1
did 1
the 1
principle 1
of 1
life 1
proceed 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
bold 1
question 1
and 1
one 1
which 1
has 1
ever 1
been 1
considered 1
as 1
a 1
mystery 1
yet 1
with 1
how 1
many 1
things 1
are 1
we 1
upon 1
the 1
brink 1
of 1
becoming 1
acquainted 1
if 1
cowardice 1
or 1
carelessness 1
did 1
not 1
restrain 1
our 1
inquiries 1
I 1
revolved 1
these 1
circumstances 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
determined 1
thenceforth 1
to 1
apply 1
myself 1
more 1
particularly 1
to 1
those 1
branches 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
which 1
relate 1
to 1
physiology 1
Unless 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
animated 1
by 1
an 1
almost 1
supernatural 1
enthusiasm 1
my 1
application 1
to 1
this 1
study 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
irksome 1
and 1
almost 1
intolerable 1
To 1
examine 1
the 1
causes 1
of 1
life 1
we 1
must 1
first 1
have 1
recourse 1
to 1
death 1
I 1
became 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
science 1
of 1
anatomy 1
but 1
this 1
was 1
not 1
sufficient 1
I 1
must 1
also 1
observe 1
the 1
natural 1
decay 1
and 1
corruption 1
of 1
the 1
human 1
body 1
In 1
my 1
education 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
taken 1
the 1
greatest 1
precautions 1
that 1
my 1
mind 1
should 1
be 1
impressed 1
with 1
no 1
supernatural 1
horrors 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
ever 1
remember 1
to 1
have 1
trembled 1
at 1
a 1
tale 1
of 1
superstition 1
or 1
to 1
have 1
feared 1
the 1
apparition 1
of 1
a 1
spirit 1
Darkness 1
had 1
no 1
effect 1
upon 1
my 1
fancy 1
and 1
a 1
churchyard 1
was 1
to 1
me 1
merely 1
the 1
receptacle 1
of 1
bodies 1
deprived 1
of 1
life 1
which 1
from 1
being 1
the 1
seat 1
of 1
beauty 1
and 1
strength 1
had 1
become 1
food 1
for 1
the 1
worm 1
Now 1
I 1
was 1
led 1
to 1
examine 1
the 1
cause 1
and 1
progress 1
of 1
this 1
decay 1
and 1
forced 1
to 1
spend 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
in 1
vaults 1
and 1
charnel 1
houses 1
My 1
attention 1
was 1
fixed 1
upon 1
every 1
object 1
the 1
most 1
insupportable 1
to 1
the 1
delicacy 1
of 1
the 1
human 1
feelings 1
I 1
saw 1
how 1
the 1
fine 1
form 1
of 1
man 1
was 1
degraded 1
and 1
wasted 1
I 1
beheld 1
the 1
corruption 1
of 1
death 1
succeed 1
to 1
the 1
blooming 1
cheek 1
of 1
life 1
I 1
saw 1
how 1
the 1
worm 1
inherited 1
the 1
wonders 1
of 1
the 1
eye 1
and 1
brain 1
I 1
paused 1
examining 1
and 1
analysing 1
all 1
the 1
minutiae 1
of 1
causation 1
as 1
exemplified 1
in 1
the 1
change 1
from 1
life 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
death 1
to 1
life 1
until 1
from 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
this 1
darkness 1
a 1
sudden 1
light 1
broke 1
in 1
upon 1
me 1
a 1
light 1
so 1
brilliant 1
and 1
wondrous 1
yet 1
so 1
simple 1
that 1
while 1
I 1
became 1
dizzy 1
with 1
the 1
immensity 1
of 1
the 1
prospect 1
which 1
it 1
illustrated 1
I 1
was 1
surprised 1
that 1
among 1
so 1
many 1
men 1
of 1
genius 1
who 1
had 1
directed 1
their 1
inquiries 1
towards 1
the 1
same 1
science 1
that 1
I 1
alone 1
should 1
be 1
reserved 1
to 1
discover 1
so 1
astonishing 1
a 1
secret 1
Remember 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
recording 1
the 1
vision 1
of 1
a 1
madman 1
The 1
sun 1
does 1
not 1
more 1
certainly 1
shine 1
in 1
the 1
heavens 1
than 1
that 1
which 1
I 1
now 1
affirm 1
is 1
true 1
Some 1
miracle 1
might 1
have 1
produced 1
it 1
yet 1
the 1
stages 1
of 1
the 1
discovery 1
were 1
distinct 1
and 1
probable 1
After 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
of 1
incredible 1
labour 1
and 1
fatigue 1
I 1
succeeded 1
in 1
discovering 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
generation 1
and 1
life 1
nay 1
more 1
I 1
became 1
myself 1
capable 1
of 1
bestowing 1
animation 1
upon 1
lifeless 1
matter 1
The 1
astonishment 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
at 1
first 1
experienced 1
on 1
this 1
discovery 1
soon 1
gave 1
place 1
to 1
delight 1
and 1
rapture 1
After 1
so 1
much 1
time 1
spent 1
in 1
painful 1
labour 1
to 1
arrive 1
at 1
once 1
at 1
the 1
summit 1
of 1
my 1
desires 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
gratifying 1
consummation 1
of 1
my 1
toils 1
But 1
this 1
discovery 1
was 1
so 1
great 1
and 1
overwhelming 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
steps 1
by 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
progressively 1
led 1
to 1
it 1
were 1
obliterated 1
and 1
I 1
beheld 1
only 1
the 1
result 1
What 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
study 1
and 1
desire 1
of 1
the 1
wisest 1
men 1
since 1
the 1
creation 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
was 1
now 1
within 1
my 1
grasp 1
Not 1
that 1
like 1
a 1
magic 1
scene 1
it 1
all 1
opened 1
upon 1
me 1
at 1
once 1
the 1
information 1
I 1
had 1
obtained 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
nature 1
rather 1
to 1
direct 1
my 1
endeavours 1
so 1
soon 1
as 1
I 1
should 1
point 1
them 1
towards 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
my 1
search 1
than 1
to 1
exhibit 1
that 1
object 1
already 1
accomplished 1
I 1
was 1
like 1
the 1
Arabian 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
buried 1
with 1
the 1
dead 1
and 1
found 1
a 1
passage 1
to 1
life 1
aided 1
only 1
by 1
one 1
glimmering 1
and 1
seemingly 1
ineffectual 1
light 1
I 1
see 1
by 1
your 1
eagerness 1
and 1
the 1
wonder 1
and 1
hope 1
which 1
your 1
eyes 1
express 1
my 1
friend 1
that 1
you 1
expect 1
to 1
be 1
informed 1
of 1
the 1
secret 1
with 1
which 1
I 1
am 1
acquainted 1
that 1
cannot 1
be 1
listen 1
patiently 1
until 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
my 1
story 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
easily 1
perceive 1
why 1
I 1
am 1
reserved 1
upon 1
that 1
subject 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
lead 1
you 1
on 1
unguarded 1
and 1
ardent 1
as 1
I 1
then 1
was 1
to 1
your 1
destruction 1
and 1
infallible 1
misery 1
Learn 1
from 1
me 1
if 1
not 1
by 1
my 1
precepts 1
at 1
least 1
by 1
my 1
example 1
how 1
dangerous 1
is 1
the 1
acquirement 1
of 1
knowledge 1
and 1
how 1
much 1
happier 1
that 1
man 1
is 1
who 1
believes 1
his 1
native 1
town 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
world 1
than 1
he 1
who 1
aspires 1
to 1
become 1
greater 1
than 1
his 1
nature 1
will 1
allow 1
When 1
I 1
found 1
so 1
astonishing 1
a 1
power 1
placed 1
within 1
my 1
hands 1
I 1
hesitated 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
concerning 1
the 1
manner 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
should 1
employ 1
it 1
Although 1
I 1
possessed 1
the 1
capacity 1
of 1
bestowing 1
animation 1
yet 1
to 1
prepare 1
a 1
frame 1
for 1
the 1
reception 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
all 1
its 1
intricacies 1
of 1
fibres 1
muscles 1
and 1
veins 1
still 1
remained 1
a 1
work 1
of 1
inconceivable 1
difficulty 1
and 1
labour 1
I 1
doubted 1
at 1
first 1
whether 1
I 1
should 1
attempt 1
the 1
creation 1
of 1
a 1
being 1
like 1
myself 1
or 1
one 1
of 1
simpler 1
organization 1
but 1
my 1
imagination 1
was 1
too 1
much 1
exalted 1
by 1
my 1
first 1
success 1
to 1
permit 1
me 1
to 1
doubt 1
of 1
my 1
ability 1
to 1
give 1
life 1
to 1
an 1
animal 1
as 1
complex 1
and 1
wonderful 1
as 1
man 1
The 1
materials 1
at 1
present 1
within 1
my 1
command 1
hardly 1
appeared 1
adequate 1
to 1
so 1
arduous 1
an 1
undertaking 1
but 1
I 1
doubted 1
not 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
ultimately 1
succeed 1
I 1
prepared 1
myself 1
for 1
a 1
multitude 1
of 1
reverses 1
my 1
operations 1
might 1
be 1
incessantly 1
baffled 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
my 1
work 1
be 1
imperfect 1
yet 1
when 1
I 1
considered 1
the 1
improvement 1
which 1
every 1
day 1
takes 1
place 1
in 1
science 1
and 1
mechanics 1
I 1
was 1
encouraged 1
to 1
hope 1
my 1
present 1
attempts 1
would 1
at 1
least 1
lay 1
the 1
foundations 1
of 1
future 1
success 1
Nor 1
could 1
I 1
consider 1
the 1
magnitude 1
and 1
complexity 1
of 1
my 1
plan 1
as 1
any 1
argument 1
of 1
its 1
impracticability 1
It 1
was 1
with 1
these 1
feelings 1
that 1
I 1
began 1
the 1
creation 1
of 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
As 1
the 1
minuteness 1
of 1
the 1
parts 1
formed 1
a 1
great 1
hindrance 1
to 1
my 1
speed 1
I 1
resolved 1
contrary 1
to 1
my 1
first 1
intention 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
being 1
of 1
a 1
gigantic 1
stature 1
that 1
is 1
to 1
say 1
about 1
eight 1
feet 1
in 1
height 1
and 1
proportionably 1
large 1
After 1
having 1
formed 1
this 1
determination 1
and 1
having 1
spent 1
some 1
months 1
in 1
successfully 1
collecting 1
and 1
arranging 1
my 1
materials 1
I 1
began 1
No 1
one 1
can 1
conceive 1
the 1
variety 1
of 1
feelings 1
which 1
bore 1
me 1
onwards 1
like 1
a 1
hurricane 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
enthusiasm 1
of 1
success 1
Life 1
and 1
death 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
ideal 1
bounds 1
which 1
I 1
should 1
first 1
break 1
through 1
and 1
pour 1
a 1
torrent 1
of 1
light 1
into 1
our 1
dark 1
world 1
A 1
new 1
species 1
would 1
bless 1
me 1
as 1
its 1
creator 1
and 1
source 1
many 1
happy 1
and 1
excellent 1
natures 1
would 1
owe 1
their 1
being 1
to 1
me 1
No 1
father 1
could 1
claim 1
the 1
gratitude 1
of 1
his 1
child 1
so 1
completely 1
as 1
I 1
should 1
deserve 1
theirs 1
Pursuing 1
these 1
reflections 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
bestow 1
animation 1
upon 1
lifeless 1
matter 1
I 1
might 1
in 1
process 1
of 1
time 1
although 1
I 1
now 1
found 1
it 1
impossible 1
renew 1
life 1
where 1
death 1
had 1
apparently 1
devoted 1
the 1
body 1
to 1
corruption 1
These 1
thoughts 1
supported 1
my 1
spirits 1
while 1
I 1
pursued 1
my 1
undertaking 1
with 1
unremitting 1
ardour 1
My 1
cheek 1
had 1
grown 1
pale 1
with 1
study 1
and 1
my 1
person 1
had 1
become 1
emaciated 1
with 1
confinement 1
Sometimes 1
on 1
the 1
very 1
brink 1
of 1
certainty 1
I 1
failed 1
yet 1
still 1
I 1
clung 1
to 1
the 1
hope 1
which 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
or 1
the 1
next 1
hour 1
might 1
realize 1
One 1
secret 1
which 1
I 1
alone 1
possessed 1
was 1
the 1
hope 1
to 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
dedicated 1
myself 1
and 1
the 1
moon 1
gazed 1
on 1
my 1
midnight 1
labours 1
while 1
with 1
unrelaxed 1
and 1
breathless 1
eagerness 1
I 1
pursued 1
nature 1
to 1
her 1
hiding 1
places 1
Who 1
shall 1
conceive 1
the 1
horrors 1
of 1
my 1
secret 1
toil 1
as 1
I 1
dabbled 1
among 1
the 1
unhallowed 1
damps 1
of 1
the 1
grave 1
or 1
tortured 1
the 1
living 1
animal 1
to 1
animate 1
the 1
lifeless 1
clay 1
My 1
limbs 1
now 1
tremble 1
and 1
my 1
eyes 1
swim 1
with 1
the 1
remembrance 1
but 1
then 1
a 1
resistless 1
and 1
almost 1
frantic 1
impulse 1
urged 1
me 1
forward 1
I 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
lost 1
all 1
soul 1
or 1
sensation 1
but 1
for 1
this 1
one 1
pursuit 1
It 1
was 1
indeed 1
but 1
a 1
passing 1
trance 1
that 1
only 1
made 1
me 1
feel 1
with 1
renewed 1
acuteness 1
so 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
unnatural 1
stimulus 1
ceasing 1
to 1
operate 1
I 1
had 1
returned 1
to 1
my 1
old 1
habits 1
I 1
collected 1
bones 1
from 1
charnel 1
houses 1
and 1
disturbed 1
with 1
profane 1
fingers 1
the 1
tremendous 1
secrets 1
of 1
the 1
human 1
frame 1
In 1
a 1
solitary 1
chamber 1
or 1
rather 1
cell 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
separated 1
from 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
apartments 1
by 1
a 1
gallery 1
and 1
staircase 1
I 1
kept 1
my 1
workshop 1
of 1
filthy 1
creation 1
my 1
eyeballs 1
were 1
starting 1
from 1
their 1
sockets 1
in 1
attending 1
to 1
the 1
details 1
of 1
my 1
employment 1
The 1
dissecting 1
room 1
and 1
the 1
slaughter 1
house 1
furnished 1
many 1
of 1
my 1
materials 1
and 1
often 1
did 1
my 1
human 1
nature 1
turn 1
with 1
loathing 1
from 1
my 1
occupation 1
whilst 1
still 1
urged 1
on 1
by 1
an 1
eagerness 1
which 1
perpetually 1
increased 1
I 1
brought 1
my 1
work 1
near 1
to 1
a 1
conclusion 1
The 1
summer 1
months 1
passed 1
while 1
I 1
was 1
thus 1
engaged 1
heart 1
and 1
soul 1
in 1
one 1
pursuit 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
most 1
beautiful 1
season 1
never 1
did 1
the 1
fields 1
bestow 1
a 1
more 1
plentiful 1
harvest 1
or 1
the 1
vines 1
yield 1
a 1
more 1
luxuriant 1
vintage 1
but 1
my 1
eyes 1
were 1
insensible 1
to 1
the 1
charms 1
of 1
nature 1
And 1
the 1
same 1
feelings 1
which 1
made 1
me 1
neglect 1
the 1
scenes 1
around 1
me 1
caused 1
me 1
also 1
to 1
forget 1
those 1
friends 1
who 1
were 1
so 1
many 1
miles 1
absent 1
and 1
whom 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
seen 1
for 1
so 1
long 1
a 1
time 1
I 1
knew 1
my 1
silence 1
disquieted 1
them 1
and 1
I 1
well 1
remembered 1
the 1
words 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
while 1
you 1
are 1
pleased 1
with 1
yourself 1
you 1
will 1
think 1
of 1
us 1
with 1
affection 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
hear 1
regularly 1
from 1
you 1
You 1
must 1
pardon 1
me 1
if 1
I 1
regard 1
any 1
interruption 1
in 1
your 1
correspondence 1
as 1
a 1
proof 1
that 1
your 1
other 1
duties 1
are 1
equally 1
neglected 1
I 1
knew 1
well 1
therefore 1
what 1
would 1
be 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
feelings 1
but 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
tear 1
my 1
thoughts 1
from 1
my 1
employment 1
loathsome 1
in 1
itself 1
but 1
which 1
had 1
taken 1
an 1
irresistible 1
hold 1
of 1
my 1
imagination 1
I 1
wished 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
to 1
procrastinate 1
all 1
that 1
related 1
to 1
my 1
feelings 1
of 1
affection 1
until 1
the 1
great 1
object 1
which 1
swallowed 1
up 1
every 1
habit 1
of 1
my 1
nature 1
should 1
be 1
completed 1
I 1
then 1
thought 1
that 1
my 1
father 1
would 1
be 1
unjust 1
if 1
he 1
ascribed 1
my 1
neglect 1
to 1
vice 1
or 1
faultiness 1
on 1
my 1
part 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
now 1
convinced 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
justified 1
in 1
conceiving 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
altogether 1
free 1
from 1
blame 1
A 1
human 1
being 1
in 1
perfection 1
ought 1
always 1
to 1
preserve 1
a 1
calm 1
and 1
peaceful 1
mind 1
and 1
never 1
to 1
allow 1
passion 1
or 1
a 1
transitory 1
desire 1
to 1
disturb 1
his 1
tranquillity 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
the 1
pursuit 1
of 1
knowledge 1
is 1
an 1
exception 1
to 1
this 1
rule 1
If 1
the 1
study 1
to 1
which 1
you 1
apply 1
yourself 1
has 1
a 1
tendency 1
to 1
weaken 1
your 1
affections 1
and 1
to 1
destroy 1
your 1
taste 1
for 1
those 1
simple 1
pleasures 1
in 1
which 1
no 1
alloy 1
can 1
possibly 1
mix 1
then 1
that 1
study 1
is 1
certainly 1
unlawful 1
that 1
is 1
to 1
say 1
not 1
befitting 1
the 1
human 1
mind 1
If 1
this 1
rule 1
were 1
always 1
observed 1
if 1
no 1
man 1
allowed 1
any 1
pursuit 1
whatsoever 1
to 1
interfere 1
with 1
the 1
tranquillity 1
of 1
his 1
domestic 1
affections 1
Greece 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
enslaved 1
Caesar 1
would 1
have 1
spared 1
his 1
country 1
America 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
discovered 1
more 1
gradually 1
and 1
the 1
empires 1
of 1
Mexico 1
and 1
Peru 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
destroyed 1
But 1
I 1
forget 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
moralizing 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
interesting 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
tale 1
and 1
your 1
looks 1
remind 1
me 1
to 1
proceed 1
My 1
father 1
made 1
no 1
reproach 1
in 1
his 1
letters 1
and 1
only 1
took 1
notice 1
of 1
my 1
silence 1
by 1
inquiring 1
into 1
my 1
occupations 1
more 1
particularly 1
than 1
before 1
Winter 1
spring 1
and 1
summer 1
passed 1
away 1
during 1
my 1
labours 1
but 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
watch 1
the 1
blossom 1
or 1
the 1
expanding 1
leaves 1
sights 1
which 1
before 1
always 1
yielded 1
me 1
supreme 1
delight 1
so 1
deeply 1
was 1
I 1
engrossed 1
in 1
my 1
occupation 1
The 1
leaves 1
of 1
that 1
year 1
had 1
withered 1
before 1
my 1
work 1
drew 1
near 1
to 1
a 1
close 1
and 1
now 1
every 1
day 1
showed 1
me 1
more 1
plainly 1
how 1
well 1
I 1
had 1
succeeded 1
But 1
my 1
enthusiasm 1
was 1
checked 1
by 1
my 1
anxiety 1
and 1
I 1
appeared 1
rather 1
like 1
one 1
doomed 1
by 1
slavery 1
to 1
toil 1
in 1
the 1
mines 1
or 1
any 1
other 1
unwholesome 1
trade 1
than 1
an 1
artist 1
occupied 1
by 1
his 1
favourite 1
employment 1
Every 1
night 1
I 1
was 1
oppressed 1
by 1
a 1
slow 1
fever 1
and 1
I 1
became 1
nervous 1
to 1
a 1
most 1
painful 1
degree 1
the 1
fall 1
of 1
a 1
leaf 1
startled 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
shunned 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
as 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
guilty 1
of 1
a 1
crime 1
Sometimes 1
I 1
grew 1
alarmed 1
at 1
the 1
wreck 1
I 1
perceived 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
become 1
the 1
energy 1
of 1
my 1
purpose 1
alone 1
sustained 1
me 1
my 1
labours 1
would 1
soon 1
end 1
and 1
I 1
believed 1
that 1
exercise 1
and 1
amusement 1
would 1
then 1
drive 1
away 1
incipient 1
disease 1
and 1
I 1
promised 1
myself 1
both 1
of 1
these 1
when 1
my 1
creation 1
should 1
be 1
complete 1
Chapter 1
It 1
was 1
on 1
a 1
dreary 1
night 1
of 1
November 1
that 1
I 1
beheld 1
the 1
accomplishment 1
of 1
my 1
toils 1
With 1
an 1
anxiety 1
that 1
almost 1
amounted 1
to 1
agony 1
I 1
collected 1
the 1
instruments 1
of 1
life 1
around 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
infuse 1
a 1
spark 1
of 1
being 1
into 1
the 1
lifeless 1
thing 1
that 1
lay 1
at 1
my 1
feet 1
It 1
was 1
already 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
the 1
rain 1
pattered 1
dismally 1
against 1
the 1
panes 1
and 1
my 1
candle 1
was 1
nearly 1
burnt 1
out 1
when 1
by 1
the 1
glimmer 1
of 1
the 1
half 1
extinguished 1
light 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
dull 1
yellow 1
eye 1
of 1
the 1
creature 1
open 1
it 1
breathed 1
hard 1
and 1
a 1
convulsive 1
motion 1
agitated 1
its 1
limbs 1
How 1
can 1
I 1
describe 1
my 1
emotions 1
at 1
this 1
catastrophe 1
or 1
how 1
delineate 1
the 1
wretch 1
whom 1
with 1
such 1
infinite 1
pains 1
and 1
care 1
I 1
had 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
form 1
His 1
limbs 1
were 1
in 1
proportion 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
selected 1
his 1
features 1
as 1
beautiful 1
Beautiful 1
Great 1
God 1
His 1
yellow 1
skin 1
scarcely 1
covered 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
muscles 1
and 1
arteries 1
beneath 1
his 1
hair 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
lustrous 1
black 1
and 1
flowing 1
his 1
teeth 1
of 1
a 1
pearly 1
whiteness 1
but 1
these 1
luxuriances 1
only 1
formed 1
a 1
more 1
horrid 1
contrast 1
with 1
his 1
watery 1
eyes 1
that 1
seemed 1
almost 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
colour 1
as 1
the 1
dun 1
white 1
sockets 1
in 1
which 1
they 1
were 1
set 1
his 1
shrivelled 1
complexion 1
and 1
straight 1
black 1
lips 1
The 1
different 1
accidents 1
of 1
life 1
are 1
not 1
so 1
changeable 1
as 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
human 1
nature 1
I 1
had 1
worked 1
hard 1
for 1
nearly 1
two 1
years 1
for 1
the 1
sole 1
purpose 1
of 1
infusing 1
life 1
into 1
an 1
inanimate 1
body 1
For 1
this 1
I 1
had 1
deprived 1
myself 1
of 1
rest 1
and 1
health 1
I 1
had 1
desired 1
it 1
with 1
an 1
ardour 1
that 1
far 1
exceeded 1
moderation 1
but 1
now 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
finished 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
the 1
dream 1
vanished 1
and 1
breathless 1
horror 1
and 1
disgust 1
filled 1
my 1
heart 1
Unable 1
to 1
endure 1
the 1
aspect 1
of 1
the 1
being 1
I 1
had 1
created 1
I 1
rushed 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
continued 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
traversing 1
my 1
bed 1
chamber 1
unable 1
to 1
compose 1
my 1
mind 1
to 1
sleep 1
At 1
length 1
lassitude 1
succeeded 1
to 1
the 1
tumult 1
I 1
had 1
before 1
endured 1
and 1
I 1
threw 1
myself 1
on 1
the 1
bed 1
in 1
my 1
clothes 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
seek 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
of 1
forgetfulness 1
But 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
vain 1
I 1
slept 1
indeed 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
disturbed 1
by 1
the 1
wildest 1
dreams 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
saw 1
Elizabeth 1
in 1
the 1
bloom 1
of 1
health 1
walking 1
in 1
the 1
streets 1
of 1
Ingolstadt 1
Delighted 1
and 1
surprised 1
I 1
embraced 1
her 1
but 1
as 1
I 1
imprinted 1
the 1
first 1
kiss 1
on 1
her 1
lips 1
they 1
became 1
livid 1
with 1
the 1
hue 1
of 1
death 1
her 1
features 1
appeared 1
to 1
change 1
and 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
I 1
held 1
the 1
corpse 1
of 1
my 1
dead 1
mother 1
in 1
my 1
arms 1
a 1
shroud 1
enveloped 1
her 1
form 1
and 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
grave 1
worms 1
crawling 1
in 1
the 1
folds 1
of 1
the 1
flannel 1
I 1
started 1
from 1
my 1
sleep 1
with 1
horror 1
a 1
cold 1
dew 1
covered 1
my 1
forehead 1
my 1
teeth 1
chattered 1
and 1
every 1
limb 1
became 1
convulsed 1
when 1
by 1
the 1
dim 1
and 1
yellow 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
moon 1
as 1
it 1
forced 1
its 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
shutters 1
I 1
beheld 1
the 1
wretch 1
the 1
miserable 1
monster 1
whom 1
I 1
had 1
created 1
He 1
held 1
up 1
the 1
curtain 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
if 1
eyes 1
they 1
may 1
be 1
called 1
were 1
fixed 1
on 1
me 1
His 1
jaws 1
opened 1
and 1
he 1
muttered 1
some 1
inarticulate 1
sounds 1
while 1
a 1
grin 1
wrinkled 1
his 1
cheeks 1
He 1
might 1
have 1
spoken 1
but 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
hear 1
one 1
hand 1
was 1
stretched 1
out 1
seemingly 1
to 1
detain 1
me 1
but 1
I 1
escaped 1
and 1
rushed 1
downstairs 1
I 1
took 1
refuge 1
in 1
the 1
courtyard 1
belonging 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
which 1
I 1
inhabited 1
where 1
I 1
remained 1
during 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
walking 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
greatest 1
agitation 1
listening 1
attentively 1
catching 1
and 1
fearing 1
each 1
sound 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
to 1
announce 1
the 1
approach 1
of 1
the 1
demoniacal 1
corpse 1
to 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
so 1
miserably 1
given 1
life 1
Oh 1
No 1
mortal 1
could 1
support 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
that 1
countenance 1
A 1
mummy 1
again 1
endued 1
with 1
animation 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
so 1
hideous 1
as 1
that 1
wretch 1
I 1
had 1
gazed 1
on 1
him 1
while 1
unfinished 1
he 1
was 1
ugly 1
then 1
but 1
when 1
those 1
muscles 1
and 1
joints 1
were 1
rendered 1
capable 1
of 1
motion 1
it 1
became 1
a 1
thing 1
such 1
as 1
even 1
Dante 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
conceived 1
I 1
passed 1
the 1
night 1
wretchedly 1
Sometimes 1
my 1
pulse 1
beat 1
so 1
quickly 1
and 1
hardly 1
that 1
I 1
felt 1
the 1
palpitation 1
of 1
every 1
artery 1
at 1
others 1
I 1
nearly 1
sank 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
through 1
languor 1
and 1
extreme 1
weakness 1
Mingled 1
with 1
this 1
horror 1
I 1
felt 1
the 1
bitterness 1
of 1
disappointment 1
dreams 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
my 1
food 1
and 1
pleasant 1
rest 1
for 1
so 1
long 1
a 1
space 1
were 1
now 1
become 1
a 1
hell 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
change 1
was 1
so 1
rapid 1
the 1
overthrow 1
so 1
complete 1
Morning 1
dismal 1
and 1
wet 1
at 1
length 1
dawned 1
and 1
discovered 1
to 1
my 1
sleepless 1
and 1
aching 1
eyes 1
the 1
church 1
of 1
Ingolstadt 1
its 1
white 1
steeple 1
and 1
clock 1
which 1
indicated 1
the 1
sixth 1
hour 1
The 1
porter 1
opened 1
the 1
gates 1
of 1
the 1
court 1
which 1
had 1
that 1
night 1
been 1
my 1
asylum 1
and 1
I 1
issued 1
into 1
the 1
streets 1
pacing 1
them 1
with 1
quick 1
steps 1
as 1
if 1
I 1
sought 1
to 1
avoid 1
the 1
wretch 1
whom 1
I 1
feared 1
every 1
turning 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
would 1
present 1
to 1
my 1
view 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
dare 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
apartment 1
which 1
I 1
inhabited 1
but 1
felt 1
impelled 1
to 1
hurry 1
on 1
although 1
drenched 1
by 1
the 1
rain 1
which 1
poured 1
from 1
a 1
black 1
and 1
comfortless 1
sky 1
I 1
continued 1
walking 1
in 1
this 1
manner 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
endeavouring 1
by 1
bodily 1
exercise 1
to 1
ease 1
the 1
load 1
that 1
weighed 1
upon 1
my 1
mind 1
I 1
traversed 1
the 1
streets 1
without 1
any 1
clear 1
conception 1
of 1
where 1
I 1
was 1
or 1
what 1
I 1
was 1
doing 1
My 1
heart 1
palpitated 1
in 1
the 1
sickness 1
of 1
fear 1
and 1
I 1
hurried 1
on 1
with 1
irregular 1
steps 1
not 1
daring 1
to 1
look 1
about 1
me 1
Like 1
one 1
who 1
on 1
a 1
lonely 1
road 1
Doth 1
walk 1
in 1
fear 1
and 1
dread 1
And 1
having 1
once 1
turned 1
round 1
walks 1
on 1
And 1
turns 1
no 1
more 1
his 1
head 1
Because 1
he 1
knows 1
a 1
frightful 1
fiend 1
Doth 1
close 1
behind 1
him 1
tread 1
Coleridge 1
s 1
Ancient 1
Mariner 1
Continuing 1
thus 1
I 1
came 1
at 1
length 1
opposite 1
to 1
the 1
inn 1
at 1
which 1
the 1
various 1
diligences 1
and 1
carriages 1
usually 1
stopped 1
Here 1
I 1
paused 1
I 1
knew 1
not 1
why 1
but 1
I 1
remained 1
some 1
minutes 1
with 1
my 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
on 1
a 1
coach 1
that 1
was 1
coming 1
towards 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
other 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
As 1
it 1
drew 1
nearer 1
I 1
observed 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
Swiss 1
diligence 1
it 1
stopped 1
just 1
where 1
I 1
was 1
standing 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
door 1
being 1
opened 1
I 1
perceived 1
Henry 1
Clerval 1
who 1
on 1
seeing 1
me 1
instantly 1
sprung 1
out 1
My 1
dear 1
Frankenstein 1
exclaimed 1
he 1
how 1
glad 1
I 1
am 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
How 1
fortunate 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
be 1
here 1
at 1
the 1
very 1
moment 1
of 1
my 1
alighting 1
Nothing 1
could 1
equal 1
my 1
delight 1
on 1
seeing 1
Clerval 1
his 1
presence 1
brought 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
thoughts 1
my 1
father 1
Elizabeth 1
and 1
all 1
those 1
scenes 1
of 1
home 1
so 1
dear 1
to 1
my 1
recollection 1
I 1
grasped 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
forgot 1
my 1
horror 1
and 1
misfortune 1
I 1
felt 1
suddenly 1
and 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
during 1
many 1
months 1
calm 1
and 1
serene 1
joy 1
I 1
welcomed 1
my 1
friend 1
therefore 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
cordial 1
manner 1
and 1
we 1
walked 1
towards 1
my 1
college 1
Clerval 1
continued 1
talking 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
about 1
our 1
mutual 1
friends 1
and 1
his 1
own 1
good 1
fortune 1
in 1
being 1
permitted 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
Ingolstadt 1
You 1
may 1
easily 1
believe 1
said 1
he 1
how 1
great 1
was 1
the 1
difficulty 1
to 1
persuade 1
my 1
father 1
that 1
all 1
necessary 1
knowledge 1
was 1
not 1
comprised 1
in 1
the 1
noble 1
art 1
of 1
book 1
keeping 1
and 1
indeed 1
I 1
believe 1
I 1
left 1
him 1
incredulous 1
to 1
the 1
last 1
for 1
his 1
constant 1
answer 1
to 1
my 1
unwearied 1
entreaties 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
Dutch 1
schoolmaster 1
in 1
The 1
Vicar 1
of 1
Wakefield 1
I 1
have 1
ten 1
thousand 1
florins 1
a 1
year 1
without 1
Greek 1
I 1
eat 1
heartily 1
without 1
Greek 1
But 1
his 1
affection 1
for 1
me 1
at 1
length 1
overcame 1
his 1
dislike 1
of 1
learning 1
and 1
he 1
has 1
permitted 1
me 1
to 1
undertake 1
a 1
voyage 1
of 1
discovery 1
to 1
the 1
land 1
of 1
knowledge 1
It 1
gives 1
me 1
the 1
greatest 1
delight 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
but 1
tell 1
me 1
how 1
you 1
left 1
my 1
father 1
brothers 1
and 1
Elizabeth 1
Very 1
well 1
and 1
very 1
happy 1
only 1
a 1
little 1
uneasy 1
that 1
they 1
hear 1
from 1
you 1
so 1
seldom 1
By 1
the 1
by 1
I 1
mean 1
to 1
lecture 1
you 1
a 1
little 1
upon 1
their 1
account 1
myself 1
But 1
my 1
dear 1
Frankenstein 1
continued 1
he 1
stopping 1
short 1
and 1
gazing 1
full 1
in 1
my 1
face 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
before 1
remark 1
how 1
very 1
ill 1
you 1
appear 1
so 1
thin 1
and 1
pale 1
you 1
look 1
as 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
been 1
watching 1
for 1
several 1
nights 1
You 1
have 1
guessed 1
right 1
I 1
have 1
lately 1
been 1
so 1
deeply 1
engaged 1
in 1
one 1
occupation 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
allowed 1
myself 1
sufficient 1
rest 1
as 1
you 1
see 1
but 1
I 1
hope 1
I 1
sincerely 1
hope 1
that 1
all 1
these 1
employments 1
are 1
now 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
at 1
length 1
free 1
I 1
trembled 1
excessively 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
endure 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
and 1
far 1
less 1
to 1
allude 1
to 1
the 1
occurrences 1
of 1
the 1
preceding 1
night 1
I 1
walked 1
with 1
a 1
quick 1
pace 1
and 1
we 1
soon 1
arrived 1
at 1
my 1
college 1
I 1
then 1
reflected 1
and 1
the 1
thought 1
made 1
me 1
shiver 1
that 1
the 1
creature 1
whom 1
I 1
had 1
left 1
in 1
my 1
apartment 1
might 1
still 1
be 1
there 1
alive 1
and 1
walking 1
about 1
I 1
dreaded 1
to 1
behold 1
this 1
monster 1
but 1
I 1
feared 1
still 1
more 1
that 1
Henry 1
should 1
see 1
him 1
Entreating 1
him 1
therefore 1
to 1
remain 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
stairs 1
I 1
darted 1
up 1
towards 1
my 1
own 1
room 1
My 1
hand 1
was 1
already 1
on 1
the 1
lock 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
before 1
I 1
recollected 1
myself 1
I 1
then 1
paused 1
and 1
a 1
cold 1
shivering 1
came 1
over 1
me 1
I 1
threw 1
the 1
door 1
forcibly 1
open 1
as 1
children 1
are 1
accustomed 1
to 1
do 1
when 1
they 1
expect 1
a 1
spectre 1
to 1
stand 1
in 1
waiting 1
for 1
them 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
but 1
nothing 1
appeared 1
I 1
stepped 1
fearfully 1
in 1
the 1
apartment 1
was 1
empty 1
and 1
my 1
bedroom 1
was 1
also 1
freed 1
from 1
its 1
hideous 1
guest 1
I 1
could 1
hardly 1
believe 1
that 1
so 1
great 1
a 1
good 1
fortune 1
could 1
have 1
befallen 1
me 1
but 1
when 1
I 1
became 1
assured 1
that 1
my 1
enemy 1
had 1
indeed 1
fled 1
I 1
clapped 1
my 1
hands 1
for 1
joy 1
and 1
ran 1
down 1
to 1
Clerval 1
We 1
ascended 1
into 1
my 1
room 1
and 1
the 1
servant 1
presently 1
brought 1
breakfast 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
contain 1
myself 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
joy 1
only 1
that 1
possessed 1
me 1
I 1
felt 1
my 1
flesh 1
tingle 1
with 1
excess 1
of 1
sensitiveness 1
and 1
my 1
pulse 1
beat 1
rapidly 1
I 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
remain 1
for 1
a 1
single 1
instant 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
place 1
I 1
jumped 1
over 1
the 1
chairs 1
clapped 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
laughed 1
aloud 1
Clerval 1
at 1
first 1
attributed 1
my 1
unusual 1
spirits 1
to 1
joy 1
on 1
his 1
arrival 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
observed 1
me 1
more 1
attentively 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
wildness 1
in 1
my 1
eyes 1
for 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
account 1
and 1
my 1
loud 1
unrestrained 1
heartless 1
laughter 1
frightened 1
and 1
astonished 1
him 1
My 1
dear 1
Victor 1
cried 1
he 1
what 1
for 1
God 1
s 1
sake 1
is 1
the 1
matter 1
Do 1
not 1
laugh 1
in 1
that 1
manner 1
How 1
ill 1
you 1
are 1
What 1
is 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
all 1
this 1
Do 1
not 1
ask 1
me 1
cried 1
I 1
putting 1
my 1
hands 1
before 1
my 1
eyes 1
for 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
dreaded 1
spectre 1
glide 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
HE 1
can 1
tell 1
Oh 1
save 1
me 1
Save 1
me 1
I 1
imagined 1
that 1
the 1
monster 1
seized 1
me 1
I 1
struggled 1
furiously 1
and 1
fell 1
down 1
in 1
a 1
fit 1
Poor 1
Clerval 1
What 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
his 1
feelings 1
A 1
meeting 1
which 1
he 1
anticipated 1
with 1
such 1
joy 1
so 1
strangely 1
turned 1
to 1
bitterness 1
But 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
witness 1
of 1
his 1
grief 1
for 1
I 1
was 1
lifeless 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
recover 1
my 1
senses 1
for 1
a 1
long 2
time 1
This 1
was 1
the 1
commencement 1
of 1
a 1
nervous 1
fever 1
which 1
confined 1
me 1
for 1
several 1
months 1
During 1
all 1
that 1
time 1
Henry 1
was 1
my 1
only 1
nurse 1
I 1
afterwards 1
learned 1
that 1
knowing 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
advanced 1
age 1
and 1
unfitness 1
for 1
so 1
long 1
a 1
journey 1
and 1
how 1
wretched 1
my 1
sickness 1
would 1
make 1
Elizabeth 1
he 1
spared 1
them 1
this 1
grief 1
by 1
concealing 1
the 1
extent 1
of 1
my 1
disorder 1
He 1
knew 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
a 1
more 1
kind 1
and 1
attentive 1
nurse 1
than 1
himself 1
and 1
firm 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
he 1
felt 1
of 1
my 1
recovery 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
doubt 1
that 1
instead 1
of 1
doing 1
harm 1
he 1
performed 1
the 1
kindest 1
action 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
towards 1
them 1
But 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
reality 1
very 1
ill 1
and 1
surely 1
nothing 1
but 1
the 1
unbounded 1
and 1
unremitting 1
attentions 1
of 1
my 1
friend 1
could 1
have 1
restored 1
me 1
to 1
life 1
The 1
form 1
of 1
the 1
monster 1
on 1
whom 1
I 1
had 1
bestowed 1
existence 1
was 1
forever 1
before 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
I 1
raved 1
incessantly 1
concerning 1
him 1
Doubtless 1
my 1
words 1
surprised 1
Henry 1
he 1
at 1
first 1
believed 1
them 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
wanderings 1
of 1
my 1
disturbed 1
imagination 1
but 1
the 1
pertinacity 1
with 1
which 1
I 1
continually 1
recurred 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
subject 1
persuaded 1
him 1
that 1
my 1
disorder 1
indeed 1
owed 1
its 1
origin 1
to 1
some 1
uncommon 1
and 1
terrible 1
event 1
By 1
very 1
slow 1
degrees 1
and 1
with 1
frequent 1
relapses 1
that 1
alarmed 1
and 1
grieved 1
my 1
friend 1
I 1
recovered 1
I 1
remember 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
I 1
became 1
capable 1
of 1
observing 1
outward 1
objects 1
with 1
any 1
kind 1
of 1
pleasure 1
I 1
perceived 1
that 1
the 1
fallen 1
leaves 1
had 1
disappeared 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
young 1
buds 1
were 1
shooting 1
forth 1
from 1
the 1
trees 1
that 1
shaded 1
my 1
window 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
divine 1
spring 1
and 1
the 1
season 1
contributed 1
greatly 1
to 1
my 1
convalescence 1
I 1
felt 1
also 1
sentiments 1
of 1
joy 1
and 1
affection 1
revive 1
in 1
my 1
bosom 1
my 1
gloom 1
disappeared 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
I 1
became 1
as 1
cheerful 1
as 1
before 1
I 1
was 1
attacked 1
by 1
the 1
fatal 1
passion 1
Dearest 1
Clerval 1
exclaimed 1
I 1
how 1
kind 1
how 1
very 1
good 1
you 1
are 1
to 1
me 1
This 1
whole 1
winter 1
instead 1
of 1
being 1
spent 1
in 1
study 1
as 1
you 1
promised 1
yourself 1
has 1
been 1
consumed 1
in 1
my 1
sick 1
room 1
How 1
shall 1
I 1
ever 1
repay 1
you 1
I 1
feel 1
the 1
greatest 1
remorse 1
for 1
the 1
disappointment 1
of 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
occasion 1
but 1
you 1
will 1
forgive 1
me 1
You 1
will 1
repay 1
me 1
entirely 1
if 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
discompose 1
yourself 1
but 1
get 1
well 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
and 1
since 1
you 1
appear 1
in 1
such 1
good 1
spirits 1
I 1
may 1
speak 1
to 1
you 1
on 1
one 1
subject 1
may 1
I 1
not 1
I 1
trembled 1
One 1
subject 1
What 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
Could 1
he 1
allude 1
to 1
an 1
object 1
on 1
whom 1
I 1
dared 1
not 1
even 1
think 1
Compose 1
yourself 1
said 1
Clerval 1
who 1
observed 1
my 1
change 1
of 1
colour 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
mention 1
it 1
if 1
it 1
agitates 1
you 1
but 1
your 1
father 1
and 1
cousin 1
would 1
be 1
very 1
happy 1
if 1
they 1
received 1
a 1
letter 1
from 1
you 1
in 1
your 1
own 1
handwriting 1
They 1
hardly 1
know 1
how 1
ill 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
and 1
are 1
uneasy 1
at 1
your 1
long 1
silence 1
Is 1
that 1
all 1
my 1
dear 1
Henry 1
How 1
could 1
you 1
suppose 1
that 1
my 1
first 1
thought 1
would 1
not 1
fly 1
towards 1
those 1
dear 2
friends 1
whom 1
I 1
love 1
and 1
who 1
are 1
so 1
deserving 1
of 1
my 1
love 1
If 1
this 1
is 1
your 1
present 1
temper 1
my 1
friend 1
you 1
will 1
perhaps 1
be 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
letter 1
that 1
has 1
been 1
lying 1
here 1
some 1
days 1
for 1
you 1
it 1
is 1
from 1
your 1
cousin 1
I 1
believe 1
Chapter 1
Clerval 1
then 1
put 1
the 1
following 1
letter 1
into 1
my 1
hands 1
It 1
was 1
from 1
my 1
own 1
Elizabeth 1
My 1
dearest 1
Cousin 1
You 1
have 1
been 1
ill 1
very 1
ill 1
and 1
even 1
the 1
constant 1
letters 1
of 1
dear 1
kind 1
Henry 1
are 1
not 1
sufficient 1
to 1
reassure 1
me 1
on 1
your 1
account 1
You 1
are 1
forbidden 1
to 1
write 1
to 1
hold 1
a 1
pen 1
yet 1
one 1
word 1
from 1
you 1
dear 1
Victor 1
is 1
necessary 1
to 1
calm 1
our 1
apprehensions 1
For 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
I 1
have 1
thought 1
that 1
each 1
post 1
would 1
bring 1
this 1
line 1
and 1
my 1
persuasions 1
have 1
restrained 1
my 1
uncle 1
from 1
undertaking 1
a 1
journey 1
to 1
Ingolstadt 1
I 1
have 1
prevented 1
his 1
encountering 1
the 1
inconveniences 1
and 1
perhaps 1
dangers 1
of 1
so 1
long 1
a 1
journey 1
yet 1
how 1
often 1
have 1
I 1
regretted 1
not 1
being 1
able 1
to 1
perform 1
it 1
myself 1
I 1
figure 1
to 1
myself 1
that 1
the 1
task 1
of 1
attending 1
on 1
your 1
sickbed 1
has 1
devolved 1
on 1
some 1
mercenary 1
old 1
nurse 1
who 1
could 1
never 1
guess 1
your 1
wishes 1
nor 1
minister 1
to 1
them 1
with 1
the 1
care 1
and 1
affection 1
of 1
your 1
poor 1
cousin 1
Yet 1
that 1
is 1
over 1
now 1
Clerval 1
writes 1
that 1
indeed 1
you 1
are 1
getting 1
better 1
I 1
eagerly 1
hope 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
confirm 1
this 1
intelligence 1
soon 1
in 1
your 1
own 1
handwriting 1
Get 1
well 1
and 1
return 1
to 1
us 1
You 1
will 1
find 1
a 1
happy 1
cheerful 1
home 1
and 1
friends 1
who 1
love 1
you 1
dearly 1
Your 1
father 1
s 1
health 1
is 1
vigorous 1
and 1
he 1
asks 1
but 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
but 1
to 1
be 1
assured 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
well 1
and 1
not 1
a 1
care 1
will 1
ever 1
cloud 1
his 1
benevolent 1
countenance 1
How 1
pleased 1
you 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
remark 1
the 1
improvement 1
of 1
our 1
Ernest 1
He 1
is 1
now 1
sixteen 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
activity 1
and 1
spirit 1
He 1
is 1
desirous 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
true 1
Swiss 1
and 1
to 1
enter 1
into 1
foreign 1
service 1
but 1
we 1
cannot 1
part 1
with 1
him 1
at 1
least 1
until 1
his 1
elder 1
brother 1
returns 1
to 1
us 1
My 1
uncle 1
is 1
not 1
pleased 1
with 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
a 1
military 1
career 1
in 1
a 1
distant 1
country 1
but 1
Ernest 1
never 1
had 1
your 1
powers 1
of 1
application 1
He 1
looks 1
upon 1
study 1
as 1
an 1
odious 1
fetter 1
his 1
time 1
is 1
spent 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
air 1
climbing 1
the 1
hills 1
or 1
rowing 1
on 1
the 1
lake 1
I 1
fear 1
that 1
he 1
will 1
become 1
an 1
idler 1
unless 1
we 1
yield 1
the 1
point 1
and 1
permit 1
him 1
to 1
enter 1
on 1
the 1
profession 1
which 1
he 1
has 1
selected 1
Little 1
alteration 1
except 1
the 1
growth 1
of 1
our 1
dear 1
children 1
has 1
taken 1
place 1
since 1
you 1
left 1
us 1
The 1
blue 1
lake 1
and 1
snow 1
clad 1
mountains 1
they 1
never 1
change 1
and 1
I 1
think 1
our 1
placid 1
home 1
and 1
our 1
contented 1
hearts 1
are 1
regulated 1
by 1
the 1
same 1
immutable 1
laws 1
My 1
trifling 1
occupations 1
take 1
up 1
my 1
time 1
and 1
amuse 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
rewarded 1
for 1
any 1
exertions 1
by 1
seeing 1
none 1
but 1
happy 1
kind 1
faces 1
around 1
me 1
Since 1
you 1
left 1
us 1
but 1
one 1
change 1
has 1
taken 1
place 1
in 1
our 1
little 1
household 1
Do 1
you 1
remember 1
on 1
what 1
occasion 1
Justine 1
Moritz 1
entered 1
our 1
family 1
Probably 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
I 1
will 1
relate 1
her 1
history 1
therefore 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
Madame 1
Moritz 1
her 1
mother 1
was 1
a 1
widow 1
with 1
four 1
children 1
of 1
whom 1
Justine 1
was 1
the 1
third 1
This 1
girl 1
had 1
always 1
been 1
the 1
favourite 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
but 1
through 1
a 1
strange 1
perversity 1
her 1
mother 1
could 1
not 1
endure 1
her 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
M 1
Moritz 1
treated 1
her 1
very 1
ill 1
My 1
aunt 1
observed 1
this 1
and 1
when 1
Justine 1
was 1
twelve 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
prevailed 1
on 1
her 1
mother 1
to 1
allow 1
her 1
to 1
live 1
at 1
our 1
house 1
The 1
republican 1
institutions 1
of 1
our 1
country 1
have 1
produced 1
simpler 1
and 1
happier 1
manners 1
than 1
those 1
which 1
prevail 1
in 1
the 1
great 1
monarchies 1
that 1
surround 1
it 1
Hence 1
there 1
is 1
less 1
distinction 1
between 1
the 1
several 1
classes 1
of 1
its 1
inhabitants 1
and 1
the 1
lower 1
orders 1
being 1
neither 1
so 1
poor 1
nor 1
so 1
despised 1
their 1
manners 1
are 1
more 1
refined 1
and 1
moral 1
A 1
servant 1
in 1
Geneva 1
does 1
not 1
mean 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
as 1
a 1
servant 1
in 1
France 1
and 1
England 1
Justine 1
thus 1
received 1
in 1
our 1
family 1
learned 1
the 1
duties 1
of 1
a 1
servant 1
a 1
condition 1
which 1
in 1
our 1
fortunate 1
country 1
does 1
not 1
include 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
ignorance 1
and 1
a 1
sacrifice 1
of 1
the 1
dignity 1
of 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
Justine 1
you 1
may 1
remember 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
favourite 1
of 1
yours 1
and 1
I 1
recollect 1
you 1
once 1
remarked 1
that 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
in 1
an 1
ill 1
humour 1
one 1
glance 1
from 1
Justine 1
could 1
dissipate 1
it 1
for 1
the 1
same 1
reason 1
that 1
Ariosto 1
gives 1
concerning 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
Angelica 1
she 1
looked 1
so 1
frank 1
hearted 1
and 1
happy 1
My 1
aunt 1
conceived 1
a 1
great 1
attachment 1
for 1
her 1
by 1
which 1
she 1
was 1
induced 1
to 1
give 1
her 1
an 1
education 1
superior 1
to 1
that 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
at 1
first 1
intended 1
This 1
benefit 1
was 1
fully 1
repaid 1
Justine 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
grateful 1
little 1
creature 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
mean 1
that 1
she 1
made 1
any 1
professions 1
I 1
never 1
heard 1
one 1
pass 1
her 1
lips 1
but 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
by 1
her 1
eyes 1
that 1
she 1
almost 1
adored 1
her 1
protectress 1
Although 1
her 1
disposition 1
was 1
gay 1
and 1
in 1
many 1
respects 1
inconsiderate 1
yet 1
she 1
paid 1
the 1
greatest 1
attention 1
to 1
every 1
gesture 1
of 1
my 1
aunt 1
She 1
thought 1
her 1
the 1
model 1
of 1
all 1
excellence 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
imitate 1
her 1
phraseology 1
and 1
manners 1
so 1
that 1
even 1
now 1
she 1
often 1
reminds 1
me 1
of 1
her 1
When 1
my 1
dearest 1
aunt 1
died 1
every 1
one 1
was 1
too 1
much 1
occupied 1
in 1
their 1
own 1
grief 1
to 1
notice 1
poor 1
Justine 1
who 1
had 1
attended 1
her 1
during 1
her 1
illness 1
with 1
the 1
most 1
anxious 1
affection 1
Poor 1
Justine 1
was 1
very 1
ill 1
but 1
other 1
trials 1
were 1
reserved 1
for 1
her 1
One 1
by 1
one 1
her 1
brothers 1
and 1
sister 1
died 1
and 1
her 1
mother 1
with 1
the 1
exception 1
of 1
her 1
neglected 1
daughter 1
was 1
left 1
childless 1
The 1
conscience 1
of 1
the 1
woman 1
was 1
troubled 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
the 1
deaths 1
of 1
her 1
favourites 1
was 1
a 1
judgement 1
from 1
heaven 1
to 1
chastise 1
her 1
partiality 1
She 1
was 1
a 1
Roman 1
Catholic 1
and 1
I 1
believe 1
her 1
confessor 1
confirmed 1
the 1
idea 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
conceived 1
Accordingly 1
a 1
few 1
months 1
after 1
your 1
departure 1
for 1
Ingolstadt 1
Justine 1
was 1
called 1
home 1
by 1
her 1
repentant 1
mother 1
Poor 1
girl 1
She 1
wept 1
when 1
she 1
quitted 1
our 1
house 1
she 1
was 1
much 1
altered 1
since 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
my 1
aunt 1
grief 1
had 1
given 1
softness 1
and 1
a 1
winning 1
mildness 1
to 1
her 1
manners 1
which 1
had 1
before 1
been 1
remarkable 1
for 1
vivacity 1
Nor 1
was 1
her 1
residence 1
at 1
her 1
mother 1
s 1
house 1
of 1
a 1
nature 1
to 1
restore 1
her 1
gaiety 1
The 1
poor 1
woman 1
was 1
very 1
vacillating 1
in 1
her 1
repentance 1
She 1
sometimes 1
begged 1
Justine 1
to 1
forgive 1
her 1
unkindness 1
but 1
much 1
oftener 1
accused 1
her 1
of 1
having 1
caused 1
the 1
deaths 1
of 1
her 1
brothers 1
and 1
sister 1
Perpetual 1
fretting 1
at 1
length 1
threw 1
Madame 1
Moritz 1
into 1
a 1
decline 1
which 1
at 1
first 1
increased 1
her 1
irritability 1
but 1
she 1
is 1
now 1
at 1
peace 1
for 1
ever 1
She 1
died 1
on 1
the 1
first 1
approach 1
of 1
cold 1
weather 1
at 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
this 1
last 1
winter 1
Justine 1
has 1
just 1
returned 1
to 1
us 1
and 1
I 1
assure 1
you 1
I 1
love 1
her 1
tenderly 1
She 1
is 1
very 1
clever 1
and 1
gentle 1
and 1
extremely 1
pretty 1
as 1
I 1
mentioned 1
before 1
her 1
mien 1
and 1
her 1
expression 1
continually 1
remind 1
me 1
of 1
my 1
dear 1
aunt 1
I 1
must 1
say 1
also 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
to 1
you 1
my 1
dear 1
cousin 1
of 1
little 1
darling 1
William 1
I 1
wish 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
him 1
he 1
is 1
very 1
tall 1
of 1
his 1
age 1
with 1
sweet 1
laughing 1
blue 1
eyes 1
dark 1
eyelashes 1
and 1
curling 1
hair 1
When 1
he 1
smiles 1
two 1
little 1
dimples 1
appear 1
on 1
each 1
cheek 1
which 1
are 1
rosy 1
with 1
health 1
He 1
has 1
already 1
had 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
little 1
WIVES 1
but 1
Louisa 1
Biron 1
is 1
his 1
favourite 1
a 1
pretty 1
little 1
girl 1
of 1
five 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
Now 1
dear 1
Victor 1
I 1
dare 1
say 1
you 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
indulged 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
gossip 1
concerning 1
the 1
good 1
people 1
of 1
Geneva 1
The 1
pretty 1
Miss 1
Mansfield 1
has 1
already 1
received 1
the 1
congratulatory 1
visits 1
on 1
her 1
approaching 1
marriage 1
with 1
a 1
young 1
Englishman 1
John 1
Melbourne 1
Esq 1
Her 1
ugly 1
sister 1
Manon 1
married 1
M 1
Duvillard 1
the 1
rich 1
banker 1
last 1
autumn 1
Your 1
favourite 1
schoolfellow 1
Louis 1
Manoir 1
has 1
suffered 1
several 1
misfortunes 1
since 1
the 1
departure 1
of 1
Clerval 1
from 1
Geneva 1
But 1
he 1
has 1
already 1
recovered 1
his 1
spirits 1
and 1
is 1
reported 1
to 1
be 1
on 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
marrying 1
a 1
lively 1
pretty 1
Frenchwoman 1
Madame 1
Tavernier 1
She 1
is 1
a 1
widow 1
and 1
much 1
older 1
than 1
Manoir 1
but 1
she 1
is 1
very 1
much 1
admired 1
and 1
a 1
favourite 1
with 1
everybody 1
I 1
have 1
written 1
myself 1
into 1
better 1
spirits 1
dear 1
cousin 1
but 1
my 1
anxiety 1
returns 1
upon 1
me 1
as 1
I 1
conclude 1
Write 1
dearest 1
Victor 1
one 1
line 1
one 1
word 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
blessing 1
to 1
us 1
Ten 1
thousand 1
thanks 1
to 1
Henry 1
for 1
his 1
kindness 1
his 1
affection 1
and 1
his 1
many 1
letters 1
we 1
are 1
sincerely 1
grateful 1
Adieu 1
my 1
cousin 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
your 1
self 1
and 1
I 1
entreat 1
you 1
write 1
Elizabeth 1
Lavenza 1
Geneva 1
March 1
Dear 1
dear 1
Elizabeth 1
I 1
exclaimed 1
when 1
I 1
had 1
read 1
her 1
letter 1
I 1
will 1
write 1
instantly 1
and 1
relieve 1
them 1
from 1
the 1
anxiety 1
they 1
must 1
feel 1
I 1
wrote 1
and 1
this 1
exertion 1
greatly 1
fatigued 1
me 1
but 1
my 1
convalescence 1
had 1
commenced 1
and 1
proceeded 1
regularly 1
In 1
another 1
fortnight 1
I 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
leave 1
my 1
chamber 1
One 1
of 1
my 1
first 1
duties 1
on 1
my 1
recovery 1
was 1
to 1
introduce 1
Clerval 1
to 1
the 1
several 1
professors 1
of 1
the 1
university 1
In 1
doing 1
this 1
I 1
underwent 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
rough 1
usage 1
ill 1
befitting 1
the 1
wounds 1
that 1
my 1
mind 1
had 1
sustained 1
Ever 1
since 1
the 1
fatal 1
night 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
my 1
labours 1
and 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
my 1
misfortunes 1
I 1
had 1
conceived 1
a 1
violent 1
antipathy 1
even 1
to 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
When 1
I 1
was 1
otherwise 1
quite 1
restored 1
to 1
health 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
a 1
chemical 1
instrument 1
would 1
renew 1
all 1
the 1
agony 1
of 1
my 1
nervous 1
symptoms 1
Henry 1
saw 1
this 1
and 1
had 1
removed 1
all 1
my 1
apparatus 1
from 1
my 1
view 1
He 1
had 1
also 1
changed 1
my 1
apartment 1
for 1
he 1
perceived 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
acquired 1
a 1
dislike 1
for 1
the 1
room 1
which 1
had 1
previously 1
been 1
my 1
laboratory 1
But 1
these 1
cares 1
of 1
Clerval 1
were 1
made 1
of 1
no 1
avail 1
when 1
I 1
visited 1
the 1
professors 1
M 1
Waldman 1
inflicted 1
torture 1
when 1
he 1
praised 1
with 1
kindness 1
and 1
warmth 1
the 1
astonishing 1
progress 1
I 1
had 1
made 1
in 1
the 1
sciences 1
He 1
soon 1
perceived 1
that 1
I 1
disliked 1
the 1
subject 1
but 1
not 1
guessing 1
the 1
real 1
cause 1
he 1
attributed 1
my 1
feelings 1
to 1
modesty 1
and 1
changed 1
the 1
subject 1
from 1
my 1
improvement 1
to 1
the 1
science 1
itself 1
with 1
a 1
desire 1
as 1
I 1
evidently 1
saw 1
of 1
drawing 1
me 1
out 1
What 1
could 1
I 1
do 1
He 1
meant 1
to 1
please 1
and 1
he 1
tormented 1
me 1
I 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
placed 1
carefully 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
in 1
my 1
view 1
those 1
instruments 1
which 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
afterwards 1
used 1
in 1
putting 1
me 1
to 1
a 1
slow 1
and 1
cruel 1
death 1
I 1
writhed 1
under 1
his 1
words 1
yet 1
dared 1
not 1
exhibit 1
the 1
pain 1
I 1
felt 1
Clerval 1
whose 1
eyes 1
and 1
feelings 1
were 1
always 1
quick 1
in 1
discerning 1
the 1
sensations 1
of 1
others 1
declined 1
the 1
subject 1
alleging 1
in 1
excuse 1
his 1
total 1
ignorance 1
and 1
the 1
conversation 1
took 1
a 1
more 1
general 1
turn 1
I 1
thanked 1
my 1
friend 1
from 1
my 1
heart 1
but 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
speak 1
I 1
saw 1
plainly 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
surprised 1
but 1
he 1
never 1
attempted 1
to 1
draw 1
my 1
secret 1
from 1
me 1
and 1
although 1
I 1
loved 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
mixture 1
of 1
affection 1
and 1
reverence 1
that 1
knew 1
no 1
bounds 1
yet 1
I 1
could 1
never 1
persuade 1
myself 1
to 1
confide 1
in 1
him 1
that 1
event 1
which 1
was 1
so 1
often 1
present 1
to 1
my 1
recollection 1
but 1
which 1
I 1
feared 1
the 1
detail 1
to 1
another 1
would 1
only 1
impress 1
more 1
deeply 1
M 1
Krempe 1
was 1
not 1
equally 1
docile 1
and 1
in 1
my 1
condition 1
at 1
that 1
time 1
of 1
almost 1
insupportable 1
sensitiveness 1
his 1
harsh 1
blunt 1
encomiums 1
gave 1
me 1
even 1
more 1
pain 1
than 1
the 1
benevolent 1
approbation 1
of 1
M 1
Waldman 1
D 1
n 1
the 1
fellow 1
cried 1
he 1
why 1
M 1
Clerval 1
I 1
assure 1
you 1
he 1
has 1
outstript 1
us 1
all 1
Ay 1
stare 1
if 1
you 1
please 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
nevertheless 1
true 1
A 1
youngster 1
who 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
years 1
ago 1
believed 1
in 1
Cornelius 1
Agrippa 1
as 1
firmly 1
as 1
in 1
the 1
gospel 1
has 1
now 1
set 1
himself 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
university 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
soon 1
pulled 1
down 1
we 1
shall 1
all 1
be 1
out 1
of 1
countenance 1
Ay 1
ay 1
continued 1
he 1
observing 1
my 1
face 1
expressive 1
of 1
suffering 1
M 1
Frankenstein 1
is 1
modest 1
an 1
excellent 1
quality 1
in 1
a 1
young 1
man 1
Young 1
men 1
should 1
be 1
diffident 1
of 1
themselves 1
you 1
know 1
M 1
Clerval 1
I 1
was 1
myself 1
when 1
young 1
but 1
that 1
wears 1
out 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
short 1
time 1
M 1
Krempe 1
had 1
now 1
commenced 1
an 1
eulogy 1
on 1
himself 1
which 1
happily 1
turned 1
the 1
conversation 1
from 1
a 1
subject 1
that 1
was 1
so 1
annoying 1
to 1
me 1
Clerval 1
had 1
never 1
sympathized 1
in 1
my 1
tastes 1
for 1
natural 1
science 1
and 1
his 1
literary 1
pursuits 1
differed 1
wholly 1
from 1
those 1
which 1
had 1
occupied 1
me 1
He 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
university 1
with 1
the 1
design 1
of 1
making 1
himself 1
complete 1
master 1
of 1
the 1
oriental 1
languages 1
and 1
thus 1
he 1
should 1
open 1
a 1
field 1
for 1
the 1
plan 1
of 1
life 1
he 1
had 1
marked 1
out 1
for 1
himself 1
Resolved 1
to 1
pursue 1
no 1
inglorious 1
career 1
he 1
turned 1
his 1
eyes 1
toward 1
the 1
East 1
as 1
affording 1
scope 1
for 1
his 1
spirit 1
of 1
enterprise 1
The 1
Persian 1
Arabic 1
and 1
Sanskrit 1
languages 1
engaged 1
his 1
attention 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
easily 1
induced 1
to 1
enter 1
on 1
the 1
same 1
studies 1
Idleness 1
had 1
ever 1
been 1
irksome 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
now 1
that 1
I 1
wished 1
to 1
fly 1
from 1
reflection 1
and 1
hated 1
my 1
former 1
studies 1
I 1
felt 1
great 1
relief 1
in 1
being 1
the 1
fellow 1
pupil 1
with 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
found 1
not 1
only 1
instruction 1
but 1
consolation 1
in 1
the 1
works 1
of 1
the 1
orientalists 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
him 1
attempt 1
a 1
critical 1
knowledge 1
of 1
their 1
dialects 1
for 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
contemplate 1
making 1
any 1
other 1
use 1
of 1
them 1
than 1
temporary 1
amusement 1
I 1
read 1
merely 1
to 1
understand 1
their 1
meaning 1
and 1
they 1
well 1
repaid 1
my 1
labours 1
Their 1
melancholy 1
is 1
soothing 1
and 1
their 1
joy 1
elevating 1
to 1
a 1
degree 1
I 1
never 1
experienced 1
in 1
studying 1
the 1
authors 1
of 1
any 1
other 1
country 1
When 1
you 1
read 1
their 1
writings 1
life 1
appears 1
to 1
consist 1
in 1
a 1
warm 1
sun 1
and 1
a 1
garden 1
of 1
roses 1
in 1
the 1
smiles 1
and 1
frowns 1
of 1
a 1
fair 1
enemy 1
and 1
the 1
fire 1
that 1
consumes 1
your 1
own 1
heart 1
How 1
different 1
from 1
the 1
manly 1
and 1
heroical 1
poetry 1
of 1
Greece 1
and 1
Rome 1
Summer 1
passed 1
away 1
in 1
these 1
occupations 1
and 1
my 1
return 1
to 1
Geneva 1
was 1
fixed 1
for 1
the 1
latter 1
end 1
of 1
autumn 1
but 1
being 1
delayed 1
by 1
several 1
accidents 1
winter 1
and 1
snow 1
arrived 1
the 1
roads 1
were 1
deemed 1
impassable 1
and 1
my 1
journey 1
was 1
retarded 1
until 1
the 1
ensuing 1
spring 1
I 1
felt 1
this 1
delay 1
very 1
bitterly 1
for 1
I 1
longed 1
to 1
see 1
my 1
native 1
town 1
and 1
my 1
beloved 1
friends 1
My 1
return 1
had 1
only 1
been 1
delayed 1
so 1
long 1
from 1
an 1
unwillingness 1
to 1
leave 1
Clerval 1
in 1
a 1
strange 1
place 1
before 1
he 1
had 1
become 1
acquainted 1
with 1
any 1
of 1
its 1
inhabitants 1
The 1
winter 1
however 1
was 1
spent 1
cheerfully 1
and 1
although 1
the 1
spring 1
was 1
uncommonly 1
late 1
when 1
it 1
came 1
its 1
beauty 1
compensated 1
for 1
its 1
dilatoriness 1
The 1
month 1
of 1
May 1
had 1
already 1
commenced 1
and 1
I 1
expected 1
the 1
letter 1
daily 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
fix 1
the 1
date 1
of 1
my 1
departure 1
when 1
Henry 1
proposed 1
a 1
pedestrian 1
tour 1
in 1
the 1
environs 1
of 1
Ingolstadt 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
bid 1
a 1
personal 1
farewell 1
to 1
the 1
country 1
I 1
had 1
so 1
long 1
inhabited 1
I 1
acceded 1
with 1
pleasure 1
to 1
this 1
proposition 1
I 1
was 1
fond 1
of 1
exercise 1
and 1
Clerval 1
had 1
always 1
been 1
my 1
favourite 1
companion 1
in 1
the 1
ramble 1
of 1
this 1
nature 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
taken 1
among 1
the 1
scenes 1
of 1
my 1
native 1
country 1
We 1
passed 1
a 1
fortnight 1
in 1
these 1
perambulations 1
my 1
health 1
and 1
spirits 1
had 1
long 1
been 1
restored 1
and 1
they 1
gained 1
additional 1
strength 1
from 1
the 1
salubrious 1
air 1
I 1
breathed 1
the 1
natural 1
incidents 1
of 1
our 1
progress 1
and 1
the 1
conversation 1
of 1
my 1
friend 1
Study 1
had 1
before 1
secluded 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
intercourse 1
of 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
and 1
rendered 1
me 1
unsocial 1
but 1
Clerval 1
called 1
forth 1
the 1
better 1
feelings 1
of 1
my 1
heart 1
he 1
again 1
taught 1
me 1
to 1
love 1
the 1
aspect 1
of 1
nature 1
and 1
the 1
cheerful 1
faces 1
of 1
children 1
Excellent 1
friend 1
how 1
sincerely 1
you 1
did 1
love 1
me 1
and 1
endeavour 1
to 1
elevate 1
my 1
mind 1
until 1
it 1
was 1
on 1
a 1
level 1
with 1
your 1
own 1
A 1
selfish 1
pursuit 1
had 1
cramped 1
and 1
narrowed 1
me 1
until 1
your 1
gentleness 1
and 1
affection 1
warmed 1
and 1
opened 1
my 1
senses 1
I 1
became 1
the 1
same 1
happy 1
creature 1
who 1
a 1
few 1
years 1
ago 1
loved 1
and 1
beloved 1
by 1
all 1
had 1
no 1
sorrow 1
or 1
care 1
When 1
happy 1
inanimate 1
nature 1
had 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
bestowing 1
on 1
me 1
the 1
most 1
delightful 1
sensations 1
A 1
serene 1
sky 1
and 1
verdant 1
fields 1
filled 1
me 1
with 1
ecstasy 1
The 1
present 1
season 1
was 1
indeed 1
divine 1
the 1
flowers 1
of 1
spring 1
bloomed 1
in 1
the 1
hedges 1
while 1
those 1
of 1
summer 1
were 1
already 1
in 1
bud 1
I 1
was 1
undisturbed 1
by 1
thoughts 1
which 1
during 1
the 1
preceding 1
year 1
had 1
pressed 1
upon 1
me 1
notwithstanding 1
my 1
endeavours 1
to 1
throw 1
them 1
off 1
with 1
an 1
invincible 1
burden 1
Henry 1
rejoiced 1
in 1
my 1
gaiety 1
and 1
sincerely 1
sympathised 1
in 1
my 1
feelings 1
he 1
exerted 1
himself 1
to 1
amuse 1
me 1
while 1
he 1
expressed 1
the 1
sensations 1
that 1
filled 1
his 1
soul 1
The 1
resources 1
of 1
his 1
mind 1
on 1
this 1
occasion 1
were 1
truly 1
astonishing 1
his 1
conversation 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
imagination 1
and 1
very 1
often 1
in 1
imitation 1
of 1
the 1
Persian 1
and 1
Arabic 1
writers 1
he 1
invented 1
tales 1
of 1
wonderful 1
fancy 1
and 1
passion 1
At 1
other 1
times 1
he 1
repeated 1
my 1
favourite 1
poems 1
or 1
drew 1
me 1
out 1
into 1
arguments 1
which 1
he 1
supported 1
with 1
great 1
ingenuity 1
We 1
returned 1
to 1
our 1
college 1
on 1
a 1
Sunday 1
afternoon 1
the 1
peasants 1
were 1
dancing 1
and 1
every 1
one 1
we 1
met 1
appeared 1
gay 1
and 1
happy 1
My 1
own 1
spirits 1
were 1
high 1
and 1
I 1
bounded 1
along 1
with 1
feelings 1
of 1
unbridled 1
joy 1
and 1
hilarity 1
Chapter 1
On 1
my 1
return 1
I 1
found 1
the 1
following 1
letter 1
from 1
my 1
father 1
My 1
dear 1
Victor 1
You 1
have 1
probably 1
waited 1
impatiently 1
for 1
a 1
letter 1
to 1
fix 1
the 1
date 1
of 1
your 1
return 1
to 1
us 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
at 1
first 1
tempted 1
to 1
write 1
only 1
a 1
few 1
lines 1
merely 1
mentioning 1
the 1
day 1
on 1
which 1
I 1
should 1
expect 1
you 1
But 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
cruel 1
kindness 1
and 1
I 1
dare 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
What 1
would 1
be 1
your 1
surprise 1
my 1
son 1
when 1
you 1
expected 1
a 1
happy 1
and 1
glad 1
welcome 1
to 1
behold 1
on 1
the 1
contrary 1
tears 1
and 1
wretchedness 1
And 1
how 1
Victor 1
can 1
I 1
relate 1
our 1
misfortune 1
Absence 1
cannot 1
have 1
rendered 1
you 1
callous 1
to 1
our 1
joys 1
and 1
griefs 1
and 1
how 1
shall 1
I 1
inflict 1
pain 1
on 1
my 1
long 1
absent 1
son 1
I 1
wish 1
to 1
prepare 1
you 1
for 1
the 1
woeful 1
news 1
but 1
I 1
know 1
it 1
is 1
impossible 1
even 1
now 1
your 1
eye 1
skims 1
over 1
the 1
page 1
to 1
seek 1
the 1
words 1
which 1
are 1
to 1
convey 1
to 1
you 1
the 1
horrible 1
tidings 1
William 1
is 1
dead 1
that 1
sweet 1
child 1
whose 1
smiles 1
delighted 1
and 1
warmed 1
my 1
heart 1
who 1
was 1
so 1
gentle 1
yet 1
so 1
gay 1
Victor 1
he 1
is 1
murdered 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
attempt 1
to 1
console 1
you 1
but 1
will 1
simply 1
relate 1
the 1
circumstances 1
of 1
the 1
transaction 1
Last 1
Thursday 1
May 1
th 1
I 1
my 1
niece 1
and 1
your 1
two 1
brothers 1
went 1
to 1
walk 1
in 1
Plainpalais 1
The 1
evening 1
was 1
warm 1
and 1
serene 1
and 1
we 1
prolonged 1
our 1
walk 1
farther 1
than 1
usual 1
It 1
was 1
already 1
dusk 1
before 1
we 1
thought 1
of 1
returning 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
discovered 1
that 1
William 1
and 1
Ernest 1
who 1
had 1
gone 1
on 1
before 1
were 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
We 1
accordingly 1
rested 1
on 1
a 1
seat 1
until 1
they 1
should 1
return 1
Presently 1
Ernest 1
came 1
and 1
enquired 1
if 1
we 1
had 1
seen 1
his 1
brother 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
playing 1
with 1
him 1
that 1
William 1
had 1
run 1
away 1
to 1
hide 1
himself 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
vainly 1
sought 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
afterwards 1
waited 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
but 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
return 1
This 1
account 1
rather 1
alarmed 1
us 1
and 1
we 1
continued 1
to 1
search 1
for 1
him 1
until 1
night 1
fell 1
when 1
Elizabeth 1
conjectured 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
He 1
was 1
not 1
there 1
We 1
returned 1
again 1
with 1
torches 1
for 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
rest 1
when 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
my 1
sweet 1
boy 1
had 1
lost 1
himself 1
and 1
was 1
exposed 1
to 1
all 1
the 1
damps 1
and 1
dews 1
of 1
night 1
Elizabeth 1
also 1
suffered 1
extreme 1
anguish 1
About 1
five 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
I 1
discovered 1
my 1
lovely 1
boy 1
whom 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
I 1
had 1
seen 1
blooming 1
and 1
active 1
in 1
health 1
stretched 1
on 1
the 1
grass 1
livid 1
and 1
motionless 1
the 1
print 1
of 1
the 1
murder 1
s 1
finger 1
was 1
on 1
his 1
neck 1
He 1
was 1
conveyed 1
home 1
and 1
the 1
anguish 1
that 1
was 1
visible 1
in 1
my 1
countenance 1
betrayed 1
the 1
secret 1
to 1
Elizabeth 1
She 1
was 1
very 1
earnest 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
corpse 1
At 1
first 1
I 1
attempted 1
to 1
prevent 1
her 1
but 1
she 1
persisted 1
and 1
entering 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
it 1
lay 1
hastily 1
examined 1
the 1
neck 1
of 1
the 1
victim 1
and 1
clasping 1
her 1
hands 1
exclaimed 1
O 1
God 1
I 1
have 1
murdered 1
my 1
darling 1
child 1
She 1
fainted 1
and 1
was 1
restored 1
with 1
extreme 1
difficulty 1
When 1
she 1
again 1
lived 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
to 1
weep 1
and 1
sigh 1
She 1
told 1
me 1
that 2
same 1
evening 1
William 1
had 1
teased 1
her 1
to 1
let 1
him 1
wear 1
a 1
very 1
valuable 1
miniature 1
that 1
she 1
possessed 1
of 1
your 1
mother 1
This 1
picture 1
is 1
gone 1
and 1
was 1
doubtless 1
the 1
temptation 1
which 1
urged 1
the 1
murderer 1
to 1
the 1
deed 1
We 1
have 1
no 1
trace 1
of 1
him 1
at 1
present 1
although 1
our 1
exertions 1
to 1
discover 1
him 1
are 1
unremitted 1
but 1
they 1
will 1
not 1
restore 1
my 1
beloved 1
William 1
Come 1
dearest 1
Victor 1
you 1
alone 1
can 1
console 1
Elizabeth 1
She 1
weeps 1
continually 1
and 1
accuses 1
herself 1
unjustly 1
as 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
his 1
death 1
her 1
words 1
pierce 1
my 1
heart 1
We 1
are 1
all 1
unhappy 1
but 1
will 1
not 1
that 1
be 1
an 1
additional 1
motive 1
for 1
you 1
my 1
son 1
to 1
return 1
and 1
be 1
our 1
comforter 1
Your 1
dear 1
mother 1
Alas 1
Victor 1
I 1
now 1
say 1
Thank 1
God 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
live 1
to 1
witness 1
the 1
cruel 1
miserable 1
death 1
of 1
her 1
youngest 1
darling 1
Come 1
Victor 1
not 1
brooding 1
thoughts 1
of 1
vengeance 1
against 1
the 1
assassin 1
but 1
with 1
feelings 1
of 1
peace 1
and 1
gentleness 1
that 1
will 1
heal 1
instead 1
of 1
festering 1
the 1
wounds 1
of 1
our 1
minds 1
Enter 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
mourning 1
my 1
friend 1
but 1
with 1
kindness 1
and 1
affection 1
for 1
those 1
who 1
love 1
you 1
and 1
not 1
with 1
hatred 1
for 1
your 1
enemies 1
Your 1
affectionate 1
and 1
afflicted 1
father 1
Alphonse 1
Frankenstein 1
Geneva 1
May 1
th 1
Clerval 1
who 1
had 1
watched 1
my 1
countenance 1
as 1
I 1
read 1
this 1
letter 1
was 1
surprised 1
to 1
observe 1
the 1
despair 1
that 1
succeeded 1
the 1
joy 1
I 1
at 1
first 1
expressed 1
on 1
receiving 1
new 1
from 1
my 1
friends 1
I 1
threw 1
the 1
letter 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
covered 1
my 1
face 1
with 1
my 1
hands 1
My 1
dear 1
Frankenstein 1
exclaimed 1
Henry 1
when 1
he 1
perceived 1
me 1
weep 1
with 1
bitterness 1
are 1
you 1
always 1
to 1
be 1
unhappy 1
My 1
dear 1
friend 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
I 1
motioned 1
him 1
to 1
take 1
up 1
the 1
letter 1
while 1
I 1
walked 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
the 1
extremest 1
agitation 1
Tears 1
also 1
gushed 1
from 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
Clerval 1
as 1
he 1
read 1
the 1
account 1
of 1
my 1
misfortune 1
I 1
can 1
offer 1
you 1
no 1
consolation 1
my 1
friend 1
said 1
he 1
your 1
disaster 1
is 1
irreparable 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
intend 1
to 1
do 1
To 1
go 1
instantly 1
to 1
Geneva 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
Henry 1
to 1
order 1
the 1
horses 1
During 1
our 1
walk 1
Clerval 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
say 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
of 1
consolation 1
he 1
could 1
only 1
express 1
his 1
heartfelt 1
sympathy 1
Poor 1
William 1
said 1
he 1
dear 1
lovely 1
child 1
he 1
now 1
sleeps 1
with 1
his 1
angel 1
mother 1
Who 1
that 1
had 1
seen 1
him 1
bright 1
and 1
joyous 1
in 1
his 1
young 1
beauty 1
but 1
must 1
weep 1
over 1
his 1
untimely 1
loss 1
To 1
die 1
so 1
miserably 1
to 1
feel 1
the 1
murderer 1
s 1
grasp 1
How 1
much 1
more 1
a 1
murdered 1
that 1
could 1
destroy 1
radiant 1
innocence 1
Poor 1
little 1
fellow 1
one 1
only 1
consolation 1
have 1
we 1
his 1
friends 1
mourn 1
and 1
weep 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
at 1
rest 1
The 1
pang 1
is 1
over 1
his 1
sufferings 1
are 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
for 1
ever 1
A 1
sod 1
covers 1
his 1
gentle 1
form 1
and 1
he 1
knows 1
no 1
pain 1
He 1
can 1
no 1
longer 1
be 1
a 1
subject 1
for 1
pity 1
we 1
must 1
reserve 1
that 1
for 1
his 1
miserable 1
survivors 1
Clerval 1
spoke 1
thus 1
as 1
we 1
hurried 1
through 1
the 1
streets 1
the 1
words 1
impressed 1
themselves 1
on 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
I 1
remembered 1
them 1
afterwards 1
in 1
solitude 1
But 1
now 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
horses 1
arrived 1
I 1
hurried 1
into 1
a 1
cabriolet 1
and 1
bade 1
farewell 1
to 1
my 1
friend 1
My 1
journey 1
was 1
very 1
melancholy 1
At 1
first 1
I 1
wished 1
to 1
hurry 1
on 1
for 1
I 1
longed 1
to 1
console 1
and 1
sympathise 1
with 1
my 1
loved 1
and 1
sorrowing 1
friends 1
but 1
when 1
I 1
drew 1
near 1
my 1
native 1
town 1
I 1
slackened 1
my 1
progress 1
I 1
could 1
hardly 1
sustain 1
the 1
multitude 1
of 1
feelings 1
that 1
crowded 1
into 1
my 1
mind 1
I 1
passed 1
through 1
scenes 1
familiar 1
to 1
my 1
youth 1
but 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
seen 1
for 1
nearly 1
six 1
years 1
How 1
altered 1
every 1
thing 1
might 1
be 1
during 1
that 1
time 1
One 1
sudden 1
and 1
desolating 1
change 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
but 1
a 1
thousand 1
little 1
circumstances 1
might 1
have 1
by 1
degrees 1
worked 1
other 1
alterations 1
which 1
although 1
they 1
were 1
done 1
more 1
tranquilly 1
might 1
not 1
be 1
the 1
less 1
decisive 1
Fear 1
overcame 1
me 1
I 1
dared 1
no 1
advance 1
dreading 1
a 1
thousand 1
nameless 1
evils 1
that 1
made 1
me 1
tremble 1
although 1
I 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
define 1
them 1
I 1
remained 1
two 1
days 1
at 1
Lausanne 1
in 1
this 1
painful 1
state 1
of 1
mind 1
I 1
contemplated 1
the 1
lake 1
the 1
waters 1
were 1
placid 1
all 1
around 1
was 1
calm 1
and 1
the 1
snowy 1
mountains 1
the 1
palaces 1
of 1
nature 1
were 1
not 1
changed 1
By 1
degrees 1
the 1
calm 1
and 1
heavenly 1
scene 1
restored 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
continued 1
my 1
journey 1
towards 1
Geneva 1
The 1
road 1
ran 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
which 1
became 1
narrower 1
as 1
I 1
approached 1
my 1
native 1
town 1
I 1
discovered 1
more 1
distinctly 1
the 1
black 1
sides 1
of 1
Jura 1
and 1
the 1
bright 1
summit 1
of 1
Mont 1
Blanc 1
I 1
wept 1
like 1
a 1
child 1
Dear 1
mountains 1
my 1
own 1
beautiful 1
lake 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
welcome 1
your 1
wanderer 1
Your 1
summits 1
are 1
clear 1
the 1
sky 1
and 1
lake 1
are 1
blue 1
and 1
placid 1
Is 1
this 1
to 1
prognosticate 1
peace 1
or 1
to 1
mock 1
at 1
my 1
unhappiness 1
I 1
fear 1
my 1
friend 1
that 1
I 1
shall 1
render 1
myself 1
tedious 1
by 1
dwelling 1
on 1
these 1
preliminary 1
circumstances 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
days 1
of 1
comparative 1
happiness 1
and 1
I 1
think 1
of 1
them 1
with 1
pleasure 1
My 1
country 1
my 1
beloved 1
country 1
who 1
but 1
a 1
native 1
can 1
tell 1
the 1
delight 1
I 1
took 1
in 1
again 1
beholding 1
thy 1
streams 1
thy 1
mountains 1
and 1
more 1
than 1
all 1
thy 1
lovely 1
lake 1
Yet 1
as 1
I 1
drew 1
nearer 1
home 1
grief 1
and 1
fear 1
again 1
overcame 1
me 1
Night 1
also 1
closed 1
around 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
could 1
hardly 1
see 1
the 1
dark 1
mountains 1
I 1
felt 1
still 1
more 1
gloomily 1
The 1
picture 1
appeared 1
a 1
vast 1
and 1
dim 1
scene 1
of 1
evil 1
and 1
I 1
foresaw 1
obscurely 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
destined 1
to 1
become 1
the 1
most 1
wretched 1
of 1
human 1
beings 1
Alas 1
I 1
prophesied 1
truly 1
and 1
failed 1
only 1
in 1
one 1
single 1
circumstance 1
that 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
misery 1
I 1
imagined 1
and 1
dreaded 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
conceive 1
the 1
hundredth 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
anguish 1
I 1
was 1
destined 1
to 1
endure 1
It 1
was 1
completely 1
dark 1
when 1
I 1
arrived 1
in 1
the 1
environs 1
of 1
Geneva 1
the 1
gates 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
were 1
already 1
shut 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
pass 1
the 1
night 1
at 1
Secheron 1
a 1
village 1
at 1
the 1
distance 1
of 1
half 1
a 1
league 1
from 1
the 1
city 1
The 1
sky 1
was 1
serene 1
and 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
rest 1
I 1
resolved 1
to 1
visit 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
my 1
poor 1
William 1
had 1
been 1
murdered 1
As 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
pass 1
through 1
the 1
town 1
I 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
cross 1
the 1
lake 1
in 1
a 1
boat 1
to 1
arrive 1
at 1
Plainpalais 1
During 1
this 1
short 1
voyage 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
lightning 1
playing 1
on 1
the 1
summit 1
of 1
Mont 1
Blanc 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
figures 1
The 1
storm 1
appeared 1
to 1
approach 1
rapidly 1
and 1
on 1
landing 1
I 1
ascended 1
a 1
low 1
hill 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
observe 1
its 1
progress 1
It 1
advanced 1
the 1
heavens 1
were 1
clouded 1
and 1
I 1
soon 1
felt 1
the 1
rain 1
coming 1
slowly 1
in 1
large 1
drops 1
but 1
its 1
violence 1
quickly 1
increased 1
I 1
quitted 1
my 1
seat 1
and 1
walked 1
on 1
although 1
the 1
darkness 1
and 1
storm 1
increased 1
every 1
minute 1
and 1
the 1
thunder 1
burst 1
with 1
a 1
terrific 1
crash 1
over 1
my 1
head 1
It 1
was 1
echoed 1
from 1
Saleve 1
the 1
Juras 1
and 1
the 1
Alps 1
of 1
Savoy 1
vivid 1
flashes 1
of 1
lightning 1
dazzled 1
my 1
eyes 1
illuminating 1
the 1
lake 1
making 1
it 1
appear 1
like 1
a 1
vast 1
sheet 1
of 1
fire 1
then 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
every 1
thing 1
seemed 1
of 1
a 1
pitchy 1
darkness 1
until 1
the 1
eye 1
recovered 1
itself 1
from 1
the 1
preceding 1
flash 1
The 1
storm 1
as 1
is 1
often 1
the 1
case 1
in 1
Switzerland 1
appeared 1
at 1
once 1
in 1
various 1
parts 1
of 1
the 1
heavens 1
The 1
most 1
violent 1
storm 1
hung 1
exactly 1
north 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
over 1
the 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
which 1
lies 1
between 1
the 1
promontory 1
of 1
Belrive 1
and 1
the 1
village 1
of 1
Copet 1
Another 1
storm 1
enlightened 1
Jura 1
with 1
faint 1
flashes 1
and 1
another 1
darkened 1
and 1
sometimes 1
disclosed 1
the 1
Mole 1
a 1
peaked 1
mountain 1
to 1
the 1
east 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
While 1
I 1
watched 1
the 1
tempest 1
so 1
beautiful 1
yet 1
terrific 1
I 1
wandered 1
on 1
with 1
a 1
hasty 1
step 1
This 1
noble 1
war 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
elevated 1
my 1
spirits 1
I 1
clasped 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
exclaimed 1
aloud 1
William 1
dear 1
angel 1
this 1
is 1
thy 1
funeral 1
this 1
thy 1
dirge 1
As 1
I 1
said 1
these 1
words 1
I 1
perceived 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
a 1
figure 1
which 1
stole 1
from 1
behind 1
a 1
clump 1
of 1
trees 1
near 1
me 1
I 1
stood 1
fixed 1
gazing 1
intently 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
mistaken 1
A 1
flash 1
of 1
lightning 1
illuminated 1
the 1
object 1
and 1
discovered 1
its 1
shape 1
plainly 1
to 1
me 1
its 1
gigantic 1
stature 1
and 1
the 1
deformity 1
of 1
its 1
aspect 1
more 1
hideous 1
than 1
belongs 1
to 1
humanity 1
instantly 1
informed 1
me 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
wretch 1
the 1
filthy 1
daemon 1
to 1
whom 1
I 1
had 1
given 1
life 1
What 1
did 1
he 1
there 1
Could 1
he 1
be 1
I 1
shuddered 1
at 1
the 1
conception 1
the 1
murderer 1
of 1
my 1
brother 1
No 1
sooner 1
did 1
that 1
idea 1
cross 1
my 1
imagination 1
than 1
I 1
became 1
convinced 1
of 1
its 1
truth 1
my 1
teeth 1
chattered 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
lean 1
against 1
a 1
tree 1
for 1
support 1
The 1
figure 1
passed 1
me 1
quickly 1
and 1
I 1
lost 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
Nothing 1
in 1
human 1
shape 1
could 1
have 1
destroyed 1
the 1
fair 1
child 1
HE 1
was 1
the 1
murderer 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
doubt 1
it 1
The 1
mere 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
idea 1
was 1
an 1
irresistible 1
proof 1
of 1
the 1
fact 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
pursuing 1
the 1
devil 1
but 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
in 1
vain 1
for 1
another 1
flash 1
discovered 1
him 1
to 1
me 1
hanging 1
among 1
the 1
rocks 1
of 1
the 1
nearly 1
perpendicular 1
ascent 1
of 1
Mont 1
Saleve 1
a 1
hill 1
that 1
bounds 1
Plainpalais 1
on 1
the 1
south 1
He 1
soon 1
reached 1
the 1
summit 1
and 1
disappeared 1
I 1
remained 1
motionless 1
The 1
thunder 1
ceased 1
but 1
the 1
rain 1
still 1
continued 1
and 1
the 1
scene 1
was 1
enveloped 1
in 1
an 1
impenetrable 1
darkness 1
I 1
revolved 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
the 1
events 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
until 1
now 1
sought 1
to 1
forget 1
the 1
whole 1
train 1
of 1
my 1
progress 1
toward 1
the 1
creation 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
the 1
works 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
hands 1
at 1
my 1
bedside 1
its 1
departure 1
Two 1
years 1
had 1
now 1
nearly 1
elapsed 1
since 1
the 1
night 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
first 1
received 1
life 1
and 1
was 1
this 1
his 1
first 1
crime 1
Alas 1
I 1
had 1
turned 1
loose 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
a 1
depraved 1
wretch 1
whose 1
delight 1
was 1
in 1
carnage 1
and 1
misery 1
had 1
he 1
not 1
murdered 1
my 1
brother 1
No 1
one 1
can 1
conceive 1
the 1
anguish 1
I 1
suffered 1
during 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
which 1
I 1
spent 1
cold 1
and 1
wet 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
air 1
But 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
feel 1
the 1
inconvenience 1
of 1
the 1
weather 1
my 1
imagination 1
was 1
busy 1
in 1
scenes 1
of 1
evil 1
and 1
despair 1
I 1
considered 1
the 1
being 1
whom 1
I 1
had 1
cast 1
among 1
mankind 1
and 1
endowed 1
with 1
the 1
will 1
and 1
power 1
to 1
effect 1
purposes 1
of 1
horror 1
such 1
as 1
the 1
deed 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
now 1
done 1
nearly 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
vampire 1
my 1
own 1
spirit 1
let 1
loose 1
from 1
the 1
grave 1
and 1
forced 1
to 1
destroy 1
all 1
that 1
was 1
dear 1
to 1
me 1
Day 1
dawned 1
and 1
I 1
directed 1
my 1
steps 1
towards 1
the 1
town 1
The 1
gates 1
were 1
open 1
and 1
I 1
hastened 1
to 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
house 1
My 1
first 1
thought 1
was 1
to 1
discover 1
what 1
I 1
knew 1
of 1
the 1
murderer 1
and 1
cause 1
instant 1
pursuit 1
to 1
be 1
made 1
But 1
I 1
paused 1
when 1
I 1
reflected 1
on 1
the 1
story 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
tell 1
A 1
being 1
whom 1
I 1
myself 1
had 1
formed 1
and 1
endued 1
with 1
life 1
had 1
met 1
me 1
at 1
midnight 1
among 1
the 1
precipices 1
of 1
an 1
inaccessible 1
mountain 1
I 1
remembered 1
also 1
the 1
nervous 1
fever 1
with 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
seized 1
just 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
I 1
dated 1
my 1
creation 1
and 1
which 1
would 1
give 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
delirium 1
to 1
a 1
tale 1
otherwise 1
so 1
utterly 1
improbable 1
I 1
well 1
knew 1
that 1
if 1
any 1
other 1
had 1
communicated 1
such 1
a 1
relation 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
looked 1
upon 1
it 1
as 1
the 1
ravings 1
of 1
insanity 1
Besides 1
the 1
strange 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
animal 1
would 1
elude 1
all 1
pursuit 1
even 1
if 1
I 1
were 1
so 1
far 1
credited 1
as 1
to 1
persuade 1
my 1
relatives 1
to 1
commence 1
it 1
And 1
then 1
of 1
what 1
use 1
would 1
be 1
pursuit 1
Who 1
could 1
arrest 1
a 1
creature 1
capable 1
of 1
scaling 1
the 1
overhanging 1
sides 1
of 1
Mont 1
Saleve 1
These 1
reflections 1
determined 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
resolved 1
to 1
remain 1
silent 1
It 1
was 1
about 1
five 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
when 1
I 1
entered 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
house 1
I 1
told 1
the 1
servants 1
not 1
to 1
disturb 1
the 1
family 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
library 1
to 1
attend 1
their 1
usual 1
hour 1
of 1
rising 1
Six 1
years 1
had 1
elapsed 1
passed 1
in 1
a 1
dream 1
but 1
for 1
one 1
indelible 1
trace 1
and 1
I 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
place 1
where 1
I 1
had 1
last 1
embraced 1
my 1
father 1
before 1
my 1
departure 1
for 1
Ingolstadt 1
Beloved 1
and 1
venerable 1
parent 1
He 1
still 1
remained 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
gazed 1
on 1
the 1
picture 1
of 1
my 1
mother 1
which 1
stood 1
over 1
the 1
mantel 1
piece 1
It 1
was 1
an 1
historical 1
subject 1
painted 1
at 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
desire 1
and 1
represented 1
Caroline 1
Beaufort 1
in 1
an 1
agony 1
of 1
despair 1
kneeling 1
by 1
the 1
coffin 1
of 1
her 1
dead 1
father 1
Her 1
garb 1
was 1
rustic 1
and 1
her 1
cheek 1
pale 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
dignity 1
and 1
beauty 1
that 1
hardly 1
permitted 1
the 1
sentiment 1
of 1
pity 1
Below 1
this 1
picture 1
was 1
a 1
miniature 1
of 1
William 1
and 1
my 1
tears 1
flowed 1
when 1
I 1
looked 1
upon 1
it 1
While 1
I 1
was 1
thus 1
engaged 1
Ernest 1
entered 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
me 1
arrive 1
and 1
hastened 1
to 1
welcome 1
me 1
Welcome 1
my 1
dearest 1
Victor 1
said 1
he 1
Ah 1
I 1
wish 1
you 1
had 1
come 1
three 1
months 1
ago 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
found 1
us 1
all 1
joyous 1
and 1
delighted 1
You 1
come 1
to 1
us 1
now 1
to 1
share 1
a 1
misery 1
which 1
nothing 1
can 1
alleviate 1
yet 1
your 1
presence 1
will 1
I 1
hope 1
revive 1
our 1
father 1
who 1
seems 1
sinking 1
under 1
his 1
misfortune 1
and 1
your 1
persuasions 1
will 1
induce 1
poor 1
Elizabeth 1
to 1
cease 1
her 1
vain 1
and 1
tormenting 1
self 1
accusations 1
Poor 1
William 1
he 1
was 1
our 1
darling 1
and 1
our 1
pride 1
Tears 1
unrestrained 1
fell 1
from 1
my 1
brother 1
s 1
eyes 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
mortal 1
agony 1
crept 1
over 1
my 1
frame 1
Before 1
I 1
had 1
only 1
imagined 1
the 1
wretchedness 1
of 1
my 1
desolated 1
home 1
the 1
reality 1
came 1
on 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
new 1
and 1
a 1
not 1
less 1
terrible 1
disaster 1
I 1
tried 1
to 1
calm 1
Ernest 1
I 1
enquired 1
more 1
minutely 1
concerning 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
here 1
I 1
named 1
my 1
cousin 1
She 1
most 1
of 1
all 1
said 1
Ernest 1
requires 1
consolation 1
she 1
accused 1
herself 1
of 1
having 1
caused 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
my 1
brother 1
and 1
that 1
made 1
her 1
very 1
wretched 1
But 1
since 1
the 1
murderer 1
has 1
been 1
discovered 1
The 1
murderer 1
discovered 1
Good 1
God 1
how 1
can 1
that 1
be 1
who 1
could 1
attempt 1
to 1
pursue 1
him 1
It 1
is 1
impossible 1
one 1
might 1
as 1
well 1
try 1
to 1
overtake 1
the 1
winds 1
or 1
confine 1
a 1
mountain 1
stream 1
with 1
a 1
straw 1
I 1
saw 1
him 1
too 1
he 1
was 1
free 1
last 1
night 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
you 1
mean 1
replied 1
my 1
brother 1
in 1
accents 1
of 1
wonder 1
but 1
to 1
us 1
the 1
discovery 1
we 1
have 1
made 1
completes 1
our 1
misery 1
No 1
one 1
would 1
believe 1
it 1
at 1
first 1
and 1
even 1
now 1
Elizabeth 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
convinced 1
notwithstanding 1
all 1
the 1
evidence 1
Indeed 1
who 1
would 1
credit 1
that 1
Justine 1
Moritz 1
who 1
was 1
so 1
amiable 1
and 1
fond 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
family 1
could 1
suddenly 1
become 1
so 1
capable 1
of 1
so 1
frightful 1
so 1
appalling 1
a 1
crime 1
Justine 1
Moritz 1
Poor 1
poor 1
girl 1
is 1
she 1
the 1
accused 1
But 1
it 1
is 1
wrongfully 1
every 1
one 1
knows 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
believes 1
it 1
surely 1
Ernest 1
No 1
one 1
did 1
at 1
first 1
but 1
several 1
circumstances 1
came 1
out 1
that 1
have 1
almost 1
forced 1
conviction 1
upon 1
us 1
and 1
her 1
own 1
behaviour 1
has 1
been 1
so 1
confused 1
as 1
to 1
add 1
to 1
the 1
evidence 1
of 1
facts 1
a 1
weight 1
that 1
I 1
fear 1
leaves 1
no 1
hope 1
for 1
doubt 1
But 1
she 1
will 1
be 1
tried 1
today 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
then 1
hear 1
all 1
He 1
then 1
related 1
that 1
the 1
morning 1
on 1
which 1
the 1
murder 1
of 1
poor 1
William 1
had 1
been 1
discovered 1
Justine 1
had 1
been 1
taken 1
ill 1
and 1
confined 1
to 1
her 1
bed 1
for 1
several 1
days 1
During 1
this 1
interval 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
servants 1
happening 1
to 1
examine 1
the 1
apparel 1
she 1
had 1
worn 1
on 1
the 1
night 1
of 1
the 1
murder 1
had 1
discovered 1
in 1
her 1
pocket 1
the 1
picture 1
of 1
my 1
mother 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
judged 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
temptation 1
of 1
the 1
murderer 1
The 1
servant 1
instantly 1
showed 1
it 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
others 1
who 1
without 1
saying 1
a 1
word 1
to 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
went 1
to 1
a 1
magistrate 1
and 1
upon 1
their 1
deposition 1
Justine 1
was 1
apprehended 1
On 1
being 1
charged 1
with 1
the 1
fact 1
the 1
poor 1
girl 1
confirmed 1
the 1
suspicion 1
in 1
a 1
great 1
measure 1
by 1
her 1
extreme 1
confusion 1
of 1
manner 1
This 1
was 1
a 1
strange 1
tale 1
but 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
shake 1
my 1
faith 1
and 1
I 1
replied 1
earnestly 1
You 1
are 1
all 1
mistaken 1
I 1
know 1
the 1
murderer 1
Justine 1
poor 1
good 1
Justine 1
is 1
innocent 1
At 1
that 1
instant 1
my 1
father 1
entered 1
I 1
saw 1
unhappiness 1
deeply 1
impressed 1
on 1
his 1
countenance 1
but 1
he 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
welcome 1
me 1
cheerfully 1
and 1
after 1
we 1
had 1
exchanged 1
our 1
mournful 1
greeting 1
would 1
have 1
introduced 1
some 1
other 1
topic 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
our 1
disaster 1
had 1
not 1
Ernest 1
exclaimed 1
Good 1
God 1
papa 1
Victor 1
says 1
that 1
he 1
knows 1
who 1
was 1
the 1
murderer 1
of 1
poor 1
William 1
We 1
do 1
also 1
unfortunately 1
replied 1
my 1
father 1
for 1
indeed 1
I 1
had 1
rather 1
have 1
been 1
for 1
ever 1
ignorant 1
than 1
have 1
discovered 1
so 1
much 1
depravity 1
and 1
ungratitude 1
in 1
one 1
I 1
valued 1
so 1
highly 1
My 1
dear 1
father 1
you 1
are 1
mistaken 1
Justine 1
is 1
innocent 1
If 1
she 1
is 1
God 1
forbid 1
that 1
she 1
should 1
suffer 1
as 1
guilty 1
She 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
tried 1
today 1
and 1
I 1
hope 1
I 1
sincerely 1
hope 1
that 1
she 1
will 1
be 1
acquitted 1
This 1
speech 1
calmed 1
me 1
I 1
was 1
firmly 1
convinced 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
mind 1
that 1
Justine 1
and 1
indeed 1
every 1
human 1
being 1
was 1
guiltless 1
of 1
this 1
murder 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
fear 1
therefore 1
that 1
any 1
circumstantial 1
evidence 1
could 1
be 1
brought 1
forward 1
strong 1
enough 1
to 1
convict 1
her 1
My 1
tale 1
was 1
not 1
one 1
to 1
announce 1
publicly 1
its 1
astounding 1
horror 1
would 1
be 1
looked 1
upon 1
as 1
madness 1
by 1
the 1
vulgar 1
Did 1
any 1
one 1
indeed 1
exist 1
except 1
I 1
the 1
creator 1
who 1
would 1
believe 1
unless 1
his 1
senses 1
convinced 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
the 1
living 1
monument 1
of 1
presumption 1
and 1
rash 1
ignorance 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
let 1
loose 1
upon 1
the 1
world 1
We 1
were 1
soon 1
joined 1
by 1
Elizabeth 1
Time 1
had 1
altered 1
her 1
since 1
I 1
last 1
beheld 1
her 1
it 1
had 1
endowed 1
her 1
with 1
loveliness 1
surpassing 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
her 1
childish 1
years 1
There 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
candour 1
the 1
same 1
vivacity 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
allied 1
to 1
an 1
expression 1
more 1
full 1
of 1
sensibility 1
and 1
intellect 1
She 1
welcomed 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
affection 1
Your 1
arrival 1
my 1
dear 1
cousin 1
said 1
she 1
fills 1
me 1
with 1
hope 1
You 1
perhaps 1
will 1
find 1
some 1
means 1
to 1
justify 1
my 1
poor 1
guiltless 1
Justine 1
Alas 1
who 1
is 1
safe 1
if 1
she 1
be 1
convicted 1
of 1
crime 1
I 1
rely 1
on 1
her 1
innocence 1
as 1
certainly 1
as 1
I 1
do 1
upon 1
my 1
own 1
Our 1
misfortune 1
is 1
doubly 1
hard 1
to 1
us 1
we 1
have 1
not 1
only 1
lost 1
that 1
lovely 1
darling 1
boy 1
but 1
this 1
poor 1
girl 1
whom 1
I 1
sincerely 1
love 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
torn 1
away 1
by 1
even 1
a 1
worse 1
fate 1
If 1
she 1
is 1
condemned 1
I 1
never 1
shall 1
know 1
joy 1
more 1
But 1
she 1
will 1
not 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
she 1
will 1
not 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
happy 1
again 1
even 1
after 1
the 1
sad 1
death 1
of 1
my 1
little 1
William 1
She 1
is 1
innocent 1
my 1
Elizabeth 1
said 1
I 1
and 1
that 1
shall 1
be 1
proved 1
fear 1
nothing 1
but 1
let 1
your 1
spirits 1
be 1
cheered 1
by 1
the 1
assurance 1
of 1
her 1
acquittal 1
How 1
kind 1
and 1
generous 1
you 1
are 1
every 1
one 1
else 1
believes 1
in 1
her 1
guilt 1
and 1
that 1
made 1
me 1
wretched 1
for 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
and 1
to 1
see 1
every 1
one 1
else 1
prejudiced 1
in 1
so 1
deadly 1
a 1
manner 1
rendered 1
me 1
hopeless 1
and 1
despairing 1
She 1
wept 1
Dearest 1
niece 1
said 1
my 1
father 1
dry 1
your 1
tears 1
If 1
she 1
is 1
as 1
you 1
believe 1
innocent 1
rely 1
on 1
the 1
justice 1
of 1
our 1
laws 1
and 1
the 1
activity 1
with 1
which 1
I 1
shall 1
prevent 1
the 1
slightest 1
shadow 1
of 1
partiality 1
Chapter 1
We 1
passed 1
a 1
few 1
sad 1
hours 1
until 1
eleven 1
o 1
clock 1
when 1
the 1
trial 1
was 1
to 1
commence 1
My 1
father 1
and 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
being 1
obliged 1
to 1
attend 1
as 1
witnesses 1
I 1
accompanied 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
court 1
During 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
this 1
wretched 1
mockery 1
of 1
justice 1
I 1
suffered 1
living 1
torture 1
It 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
decided 1
whether 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
my 1
curiosity 1
and 1
lawless 1
devices 1
would 1
cause 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
two 1
of 1
my 1
fellow 1
beings 1
one 1
a 1
smiling 1
babe 1
full 1
of 1
innocence 1
and 1
joy 1
the 1
other 1
far 1
more 1
dreadfully 1
murdered 1
with 1
every 1
aggravation 1
of 1
infamy 1
that 1
could 1
make 1
the 1
murder 1
memorable 1
in 1
horror 1
Justine 1
also 1
was 1
a 1
girl 1
of 1
merit 1
and 1
possessed 1
qualities 1
which 1
promised 1
to 1
render 1
her 1
life 1
happy 1
now 1
all 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
obliterated 1
in 1
an 1
ignominious 1
grave 1
and 1
I 1
the 1
cause 1
A 1
thousand 1
times 1
rather 1
would 1
I 1
have 1
confessed 1
myself 1
guilty 1
of 1
the 1
crime 1
ascribed 1
to 1
Justine 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
absent 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
committed 1
and 1
such 1
a 1
declaration 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
considered 1
as 1
the 1
ravings 1
of 1
a 1
madman 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
exculpated 1
her 1
who 1
suffered 1
through 1
me 1
The 1
appearance 1
of 1
Justine 1
was 1
calm 1
She 1
was 1
dressed 1
in 1
mourning 1
and 1
her 1
countenance 1
always 1
engaging 1
was 1
rendered 1
by 1
the 1
solemnity 1
of 1
her 1
feelings 1
exquisitely 1
beautiful 1
Yet 1
she 1
appeared 1
confident 1
in 1
innocence 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
tremble 1
although 1
gazed 1
on 1
and 1
execrated 1
by 1
thousands 1
for 1
all 1
the 1
kindness 1
which 1
her 1
beauty 1
might 1
otherwise 1
have 1
excited 1
was 1
obliterated 1
in 1
the 1
minds 1
of 1
the 1
spectators 1
by 1
the 1
imagination 1
of 1
the 1
enormity 1
she 1
was 1
supposed 1
to 1
have 1
committed 1
She 1
was 1
tranquil 1
yet 1
her 1
tranquillity 1
was 1
evidently 1
constrained 1
and 1
as 1
her 1
confusion 1
had 1
before 1
been 1
adduced 1
as 1
a 1
proof 1
of 1
her 1
guilt 1
she 1
worked 1
up 1
her 1
mind 1
to 1
an 1
appearance 1
of 1
courage 1
When 1
she 1
entered 1
the 1
court 1
she 1
threw 1
her 1
eyes 1
round 1
it 1
and 1
quickly 1
discovered 1
where 1
we 1
were 1
seated 1
A 1
tear 1
seemed 1
to 1
dim 1
her 1
eye 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
us 1
but 1
she 1
quickly 1
recovered 1
herself 1
and 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
sorrowful 1
affection 1
seemed 1
to 1
attest 1
her 1
utter 1
guiltlessness 1
The 1
trial 1
began 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
advocate 1
against 1
her 1
had 1
stated 1
the 1
charge 1
several 1
witnesses 1
were 1
called 1
Several 1
strange 1
facts 1
combined 1
against 1
her 1
which 1
might 1
have 1
staggered 1
anyone 1
who 1
had 1
not 1
such 1
proof 1
of 1
her 1
innocence 1
as 1
I 1
had 1
She 1
had 1
been 1
out 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
on 1
which 1
the 1
murder 1
had 1
been 1
committed 1
and 1
towards 1
morning 1
had 1
been 1
perceived 1
by 1
a 1
market 1
woman 1
not 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
the 1
murdered 1
child 1
had 1
been 1
afterwards 1
found 1
The 1
woman 1
asked 1
her 1
what 1
she 1
did 1
there 1
but 1
she 1
looked 1
very 1
strangely 1
and 1
only 1
returned 1
a 1
confused 1
and 1
unintelligible 1
answer 1
She 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
about 1
eight 1
o 1
clock 1
and 1
when 1
one 1
inquired 1
where 1
she 1
had 1
passed 1
the 1
night 1
she 1
replied 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
looking 1
for 1
the 1
child 1
and 1
demanded 1
earnestly 1
if 1
anything 1
had 1
been 1
heard 1
concerning 1
him 1
When 1
shown 1
the 1
body 1
she 1
fell 1
into 1
violent 1
hysterics 1
and 1
kept 1
her 1
bed 1
for 1
several 1
days 1
The 1
picture 1
was 1
then 1
produced 1
which 1
the 1
servant 1
had 1
found 1
in 1
her 1
pocket 1
and 1
when 1
Elizabeth 1
in 1
a 1
faltering 1
voice 1
proved 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
which 1
an 1
hour 1
before 1
the 1
child 1
had 1
been 1
missed 1
she 1
had 1
placed 1
round 1
his 1
neck 1
a 1
murmur 1
of 1
horror 1
and 1
indignation 1
filled 1
the 1
court 1
Justine 1
was 1
called 1
on 1
for 1
her 1
defence 1
As 1
the 1
trial 1
had 1
proceeded 1
her 1
countenance 1
had 1
altered 1
Surprise 1
horror 1
and 1
misery 1
were 1
strongly 1
expressed 1
Sometimes 1
she 1
struggled 1
with 1
her 1
tears 1
but 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
desired 1
to 1
plead 1
she 1
collected 1
her 1
powers 1
and 1
spoke 1
in 1
an 1
audible 1
although 1
variable 1
voice 1
God 1
knows 1
she 1
said 1
how 1
entirely 1
I 1
am 1
innocent 1
But 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
pretend 1
that 1
my 1
protestations 1
should 1
acquit 1
me 1
I 1
rest 1
my 1
innocence 1
on 1
a 1
plain 1
and 1
simple 1
explanation 1
of 1
the 1
facts 1
which 1
have 1
been 1
adduced 1
against 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
hope 1
the 1
character 1
I 1
have 1
always 1
borne 1
will 1
incline 1
my 1
judges 1
to 1
a 1
favourable 1
interpretation 1
where 1
any 1
circumstance 1
appears 1
doubtful 1
or 1
suspicious 1
She 1
then 1
related 1
that 1
by 1
the 1
permission 1
of 1
Elizabeth 1
she 1
had 1
passed 1
the 1
evening 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
on 1
which 1
the 1
murder 1
had 1
been 1
committed 1
at 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
an 1
aunt 1
at 1
Chene 1
a 1
village 1
situated 1
at 1
about 1
a 1
league 1
from 1
Geneva 1
On 1
her 1
return 1
at 1
about 1
nine 1
o 1
clock 1
she 1
met 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
asked 1
her 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
seen 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
who 1
was 1
lost 1
She 1
was 1
alarmed 1
by 1
this 1
account 1
and 1
passed 1
several 1
hours 1
in 1
looking 1
for 1
him 1
when 1
the 1
gates 1
of 1
Geneva 1
were 1
shut 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
remain 1
several 1
hours 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
in 1
a 1
barn 1
belonging 1
to 1
a 1
cottage 1
being 1
unwilling 1
to 1
call 1
up 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
to 1
whom 1
she 1
was 1
well 1
known 1
Most 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
she 1
spent 1
here 1
watching 1
towards 1
morning 1
she 1
believed 1
that 1
she 1
slept 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
some 1
steps 1
disturbed 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
awoke 1
It 1
was 1
dawn 1
and 1
she 1
quitted 1
her 1
asylum 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
again 1
endeavour 1
to 1
find 1
my 1
brother 1
If 1
she 1
had 1
gone 1
near 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
his 1
body 1
lay 1
it 1
was 1
without 1
her 1
knowledge 1
That 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
bewildered 1
when 1
questioned 1
by 1
the 1
market 1
woman 1
was 1
not 1
surprising 1
since 1
she 1
had 1
passed 1
a 1
sleepless 1
night 1
and 1
the 1
fate 1
of 1
poor 1
William 1
was 1
yet 1
uncertain 1
Concerning 1
the 1
picture 1
she 1
could 1
give 1
no 1
account 1
I 1
know 1
continued 1
the 1
unhappy 1
victim 1
how 1
heavily 1
and 1
fatally 1
this 1
one 1
circumstance 1
weighs 1
against 1
me 1
but 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
power 1
of 1
explaining 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
have 1
expressed 1
my 1
utter 1
ignorance 1
I 1
am 1
only 1
left 1
to 1
conjecture 1
concerning 1
the 1
probabilities 1
by 1
which 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
placed 1
in 1
my 1
pocket 1
But 1
here 1
also 1
I 1
am 1
checked 1
I 1
believe 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
enemy 1
on 1
earth 1
and 1
none 1
surely 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
wicked 1
as 1
to 1
destroy 1
me 1
wantonly 1
Did 1
the 1
murderer 1
place 1
it 1
there 1
I 1
know 1
of 1
no 1
opportunity 1
afforded 1
him 1
for 1
so 1
doing 1
or 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
why 1
should 1
he 1
have 1
stolen 1
the 1
jewel 1
to 1
part 1
with 1
it 1
again 1
so 1
soon 1
I 1
commit 1
my 1
cause 1
to 1
the 1
justice 1
of 1
my 1
judges 1
yet 1
I 1
see 1
no 1
room 1
for 1
hope 1
I 1
beg 1
permission 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
few 1
witnesses 1
examined 1
concerning 1
my 1
character 1
and 1
if 1
their 1
testimony 1
shall 1
not 1
overweigh 1
my 1
supposed 1
guilt 1
I 1
must 1
be 1
condemned 1
although 1
I 1
would 1
pledge 1
my 1
salvation 1
on 1
my 1
innocence 1
Several 1
witnesses 1
were 1
called 1
who 1
had 1
known 1
her 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
and 1
they 1
spoke 1
well 1
of 1
her 1
but 1
fear 1
and 1
hatred 1
of 1
the 1
crime 1
of 1
which 1
they 1
supposed 1
her 1
guilty 1
rendered 1
them 1
timorous 1
and 1
unwilling 1
to 1
come 1
forward 1
Elizabeth 1
saw 1
even 1
this 1
last 1
resource 1
her 1
excellent 1
dispositions 1
and 1
irreproachable 1
conduct 1
about 1
to 1
fail 1
the 1
accused 1
when 1
although 1
violently 1
agitated 1
she 1
desired 1
permission 1
to 1
address 1
the 1
court 1
I 1
am 1
said 1
she 1
the 1
cousin 1
of 1
the 1
unhappy 1
child 1
who 1
was 1
murdered 1
or 1
rather 1
his 1
sister 1
for 1
I 1
was 1
educated 1
by 1
and 1
have 1
lived 1
with 1
his 1
parents 1
ever 1
since 1
and 1
even 1
long 1
before 1
his 1
birth 1
It 1
may 1
therefore 1
be 1
judged 1
indecent 1
in 1
me 1
to 1
come 1
forward 1
on 1
this 1
occasion 1
but 1
when 1
I 1
see 1
a 1
fellow 1
creature 1
about 1
to 1
perish 1
through 1
the 1
cowardice 1
of 1
her 1
pretended 1
friends 1
I 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
speak 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
say 1
what 1
I 1
know 1
of 1
her 1
character 1
I 1
am 1
well 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
accused 1
I 1
have 1
lived 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
house 1
with 1
her 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
for 1
five 1
and 1
at 1
another 1
for 1
nearly 1
two 1
years 1
During 1
all 1
that 1
period 1
she 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
most 1
amiable 1
and 1
benevolent 1
of 1
human 1
creatures 1
She 1
nursed 1
Madame 1
Frankenstein 1
my 1
aunt 1
in 1
her 1
last 1
illness 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
affection 1
and 1
care 1
and 1
afterwards 1
attended 1
her 1
own 1
mother 1
during 1
a 1
tedious 1
illness 1
in 1
a 1
manner 1
that 1
excited 1
the 1
admiration 1
of 1
all 1
who 1
knew 1
her 1
after 1
which 1
she 1
again 1
lived 1
in 1
my 1
uncle 1
s 1
house 1
where 1
she 1
was 1
beloved 1
by 1
all 1
the 1
family 1
She 1
was 1
warmly 1
attached 1
to 1
the 1
child 1
who 1
is 1
now 1
dead 1
and 1
acted 1
towards 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
most 1
affectionate 1
mother 1
For 1
my 1
own 1
part 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
hesitate 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
notwithstanding 1
all 1
the 1
evidence 1
produced 1
against 1
her 1
I 1
believe 1
and 1
rely 1
on 1
her 1
perfect 1
innocence 1
She 1
had 1
no 1
temptation 1
for 1
such 1
an 1
action 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
bauble 1
on 1
which 1
the 1
chief 1
proof 1
rests 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
earnestly 1
desired 1
it 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
willingly 1
given 1
it 1
to 1
her 1
so 1
much 1
do 1
I 1
esteem 1
and 1
value 1
her 1
A 1
murmur 1
of 1
approbation 1
followed 1
Elizabeth 1
s 1
simple 1
and 1
powerful 1
appeal 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
excited 1
by 1
her 1
generous 1
interference 1
and 1
not 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
poor 1
Justine 1
on 1
whom 1
the 1
public 1
indignation 1
was 1
turned 1
with 1
renewed 1
violence 1
charging 1
her 1
with 1
the 1
blackest 1
ingratitude 1
She 1
herself 1
wept 1
as 1
Elizabeth 1
spoke 1
but 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
answer 1
My 1
own 1
agitation 1
and 1
anguish 1
was 1
extreme 1
during 1
the 1
whole 1
trial 1
I 1
believed 1
in 1
her 1
innocence 1
I 1
knew 1
it 1
Could 1
the 1
demon 1
who 1
had 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
doubt 1
murdered 1
my 1
brother 1
also 1
in 1
his 1
hellish 1
sport 1
have 1
betrayed 1
the 1
innocent 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
ignominy 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
sustain 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
my 1
situation 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
perceived 1
that 1
the 1
popular 1
voice 1
and 1
the 1
countenances 1
of 1
the 1
judges 1
had 1
already 1
condemned 1
my 1
unhappy 1
victim 1
I 1
rushed 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
court 1
in 1
agony 1
The 1
tortures 1
of 1
the 1
accused 1
did 1
not 1
equal 1
mine 1
she 1
was 1
sustained 1
by 1
innocence 1
but 1
the 1
fangs 1
of 1
remorse 1
tore 1
my 1
bosom 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
forgo 1
their 1
hold 1
I 1
passed 1
a 1
night 1
of 1
unmingled 1
wretchedness 1
In 1
the 1
morning 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
court 1
my 1
lips 1
and 1
throat 1
were 1
parched 1
I 1
dared 1
not 1
ask 1
the 1
fatal 1
question 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
known 1
and 1
the 1
officer 1
guessed 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
my 1
visit 1
The 1
ballots 1
had 1
been 1
thrown 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
black 1
and 1
Justine 1
was 1
condemned 1
I 1
cannot 1
pretend 1
to 1
describe 1
what 1
I 1
then 1
felt 1
I 1
had 1
before 1
experienced 1
sensations 1
of 1
horror 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
bestow 1
upon 1
them 1
adequate 1
expressions 1
but 1
words 1
cannot 1
convey 1
an 1
idea 1
of 1
the 1
heart 1
sickening 1
despair 1
that 1
I 1
then 1
endured 1
The 1
person 1
to 1
whom 1
I 1
addressed 1
myself 1
added 1
that 1
Justine 1
had 1
already 1
confessed 1
her 1
guilt 1
That 1
evidence 1
he 1
observed 1
was 1
hardly 1
required 1
in 1
so 1
glaring 1
a 1
case 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
glad 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
indeed 1
none 1
of 1
our 1
judges 1
like 1
to 1
condemn 1
a 1
criminal 1
upon 1
circumstantial 1
evidence 1
be 1
it 1
ever 1
so 1
decisive 1
This 1
was 1
strange 1
and 1
unexpected 1
intelligence 1
what 1
could 1
it 1
mean 1
Had 1
my 1
eyes 1
deceived 1
me 1
And 1
was 1
I 1
really 1
as 1
mad 1
as 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
would 1
believe 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
if 1
I 1
disclosed 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
my 1
suspicions 1
I 1
hastened 1
to 1
return 1
home 1
and 1
Elizabeth 1
eagerly 1
demanded 1
the 1
result 1
My 1
cousin 1
replied 1
I 1
it 1
is 1
decided 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
expected 1
all 1
judges 1
had 1
rather 1
that 1
ten 1
innocent 1
should 1
suffer 1
than 1
that 1
one 1
guilty 1
should 1
escape 1
But 1
she 1
has 1
confessed 1
This 1
was 1
a 1
dire 1
blow 1
to 1
poor 1
Elizabeth 1
who 1
had 1
relied 1
with 1
firmness 1
upon 1
Justine 1
s 1
innocence 1
Alas 1
said 1
she 1
How 1
shall 1
I 1
ever 1
again 1
believe 1
in 1
human 1
goodness 1
Justine 1
whom 1
I 1
loved 1
and 1
esteemed 1
as 1
my 1
sister 1
how 1
could 1
she 1
put 1
on 1
those 1
smiles 1
of 1
innocence 1
only 1
to 1
betray 1
Her 1
mild 1
eyes 1
seemed 1
incapable 1
of 1
any 1
severity 1
or 1
guile 1
and 1
yet 1
she 1
has 1
committed 1
a 1
murder 1
Soon 1
after 1
we 1
heard 1
that 1
the 1
poor 1
victim 1
had 1
expressed 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
see 1
my 1
cousin 1
My 1
father 1
wished 1
her 1
not 1
to 1
go 1
but 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
left 1
it 1
to 1
her 1
own 1
judgment 1
and 1
feelings 1
to 1
decide 1
Yes 1
said 1
Elizabeth 1
I 1
will 1
go 1
although 1
she 1
is 1
guilty 1
and 1
you 1
Victor 1
shall 1
accompany 1
me 1
I 1
cannot 1
go 1
alone 1
The 1
idea 1
of 1
this 1
visit 1
was 1
torture 1
to 1
me 1
yet 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
refuse 1
We 1
entered 1
the 1
gloomy 1
prison 1
chamber 1
and 1
beheld 1
Justine 1
sitting 1
on 1
some 1
straw 1
at 1
the 1
farther 1
end 1
her 1
hands 1
were 1
manacled 1
and 1
her 1
head 1
rested 1
on 1
her 1
knees 1
She 1
rose 1
on 1
seeing 1
us 1
enter 1
and 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
left 1
alone 1
with 1
her 1
she 1
threw 1
herself 1
at 1
the 1
feet 1
of 1
Elizabeth 1
weeping 1
bitterly 1
My 1
cousin 1
wept 1
also 1
Oh 1
Justine 1
said 1
she 1
Why 1
did 1
you 1
rob 1
me 1
of 1
my 1
last 1
consolation 1
I 1
relied 1
on 1
your 1
innocence 1
and 1
although 1
I 1
was 1
then 1
very 1
wretched 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
so 1
miserable 1
as 1
I 1
am 1
now 1
And 1
do 1
you 1
also 1
believe 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
very 2
wicked 1
Do 1
you 1
also 1
join 1
with 1
my 1
enemies 1
to 1
crush 1
me 1
to 1
condemn 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
murderer 1
Her 1
voice 1
was 1
suffocated 1
with 1
sobs 1
Rise 1
my 1
poor 1
girl 1
said 1
Elizabeth 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
kneel 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
innocent 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
your 1
enemies 1
I 1
believed 1
you 1
guiltless 1
notwithstanding 1
every 1
evidence 1
until 1
I 1
heard 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
yourself 1
declared 1
your 1
guilt 1
That 1
report 1
you 1
say 1
is 1
false 1
and 1
be 1
assured 1
dear 1
Justine 1
that 1
nothing 1
can 1
shake 1
my 1
confidence 1
in 1
you 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
but 1
your 1
own 1
confession 1
I 1
did 1
confess 1
but 1
I 1
confessed 1
a 1
lie 1
I 1
confessed 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
obtain 1
absolution 1
but 1
now 1
that 1
falsehood 1
lies 1
heavier 1
at 1
my 1
heart 1
than 1
all 1
my 1
other 1
sins 1
The 1
God 1
of 1
heaven 1
forgive 1
me 1
Ever 1
since 1
I 1
was 1
condemned 1
my 1
confessor 1
has 1
besieged 1
me 1
he 1
threatened 1
and 1
menaced 1
until 1
I 1
almost 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
the 1
monster 1
that 1
he 1
said 1
I 1
was 1
He 1
threatened 1
excommunication 1
and 1
hell 1
fire 1
in 1
my 1
last 1
moments 1
if 1
I 1
continued 1
obdurate 1
Dear 1
lady 1
I 1
had 1
none 1
to 1
support 1
me 1
all 1
looked 1
on 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
wretch 1
doomed 1
to 1
ignominy 1
and 1
perdition 1
What 1
could 1
I 1
do 1
In 1
an 1
evil 1
hour 1
I 1
subscribed 1
to 1
a 1
lie 1
and 1
now 1
only 1
am 1
I 1
truly 1
miserable 1
She 1
paused 1
weeping 1
and 1
then 1
continued 1
I 1
thought 1
with 1
horror 1
my 1
sweet 1
lady 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
believe 1
your 1
Justine 1
whom 1
your 1
blessed 1
aunt 1
had 1
so 1
highly 1
honoured 1
and 1
whom 1
you 1
loved 1
was 1
a 1
creature 1
capable 1
of 1
a 1
crime 1
which 1
none 1
but 1
the 1
devil 1
himself 1
could 1
have 1
perpetrated 1
Dear 1
William 1
dearest 1
blessed 1
child 1
I 1
soon 1
shall 1
see 1
you 1
again 1
in 1
heaven 1
where 1
we 1
shall 1
all 1
be 1
happy 1
and 1
that 1
consoles 1
me 1
going 1
as 1
I 1
am 1
to 1
suffer 1
ignominy 1
and 1
death 1
Oh 1
Justine 1
Forgive 1
me 1
for 1
having 1
for 1
one 1
moment 1
distrusted 1
you 1
Why 1
did 1
you 1
confess 1
But 1
do 1
not 1
mourn 1
dear 1
girl 1
Do 1
not 1
fear 1
I 1
will 1
proclaim 1
I 1
will 1
prove 1
your 1
innocence 1
I 1
will 1
melt 1
the 1
stony 1
hearts 1
of 1
your 1
enemies 1
by 1
my 1
tears 1
and 1
prayers 1
You 1
shall 1
not 1
die 1
You 1
my 1
playfellow 1
my 1
companion 1
my 1
sister 1
perish 1
on 1
the 1
scaffold 1
No 2
I 1
never 1
could 1
survive 1
so 1
horrible 1
a 1
misfortune 1
Justine 1
shook 1
her 1
head 1
mournfully 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
fear 1
to 1
die 1
she 1
said 1
that 1
pang 1
is 1
past 1
God 1
raises 1
my 1
weakness 1
and 1
gives 1
me 1
courage 1
to 1
endure 1
the 1
worst 1
I 1
leave 1
a 1
sad 1
and 1
bitter 1
world 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
remember 1
me 1
and 1
think 1
of 1
me 1
as 1
of 1
one 1
unjustly 1
condemned 1
I 1
am 1
resigned 1
to 1
the 1
fate 1
awaiting 1
me 1
Learn 1
from 1
me 1
dear 1
lady 1
to 1
submit 1
in 1
patience 1
to 1
the 1
will 1
of 1
heaven 1
During 1
this 1
conversation 1
I 1
had 1
retired 1
to 1
a 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
prison 1
room 1
where 1
I 1
could 1
conceal 1
the 1
horrid 1
anguish 1
that 1
possessed 1
me 1
Despair 1
Who 1
dared 1
talk 1
of 1
that 1
The 1
poor 1
victim 1
who 1
on 1
the 1
morrow 1
was 1
to 1
pass 1
the 1
awful 1
boundary 1
between 1
life 1
and 1
death 1
felt 1
not 1
as 1
I 1
did 1
such 1
deep 1
and 1
bitter 1
agony 1
I 1
gnashed 1
my 1
teeth 1
and 1
ground 1
them 1
together 1
uttering 1
a 1
groan 1
that 1
came 1
from 1
my 1
inmost 1
soul 1
Justine 1
started 1
When 1
she 1
saw 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
she 1
approached 1
me 1
and 1
said 1
Dear 1
sir 1
you 1
are 1
very 1
kind 1
to 1
visit 1
me 1
you 1
I 1
hope 1
do 1
not 1
believe 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
guilty 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
answer 1
No 1
Justine 1
said 1
Elizabeth 1
he 1
is 1
more 1
convinced 1
of 1
your 1
innocence 1
than 1
I 1
was 1
for 1
even 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
confessed 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
credit 1
it 1
I 1
truly 1
thank 1
him 1
In 1
these 1
last 1
moments 1
I 1
feel 1
the 1
sincerest 1
gratitude 1
towards 1
those 1
who 1
think 1
of 1
me 1
with 1
kindness 1
How 1
sweet 1
is 1
the 1
affection 1
of 1
others 1
to 1
such 1
a 1
wretch 1
as 1
I 1
am 1
It 1
removes 1
more 1
than 1
half 1
my 1
misfortune 1
and 1
I 1
feel 1
as 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
die 1
in 1
peace 1
now 1
that 1
my 1
innocence 1
is 1
acknowledged 1
by 1
you 1
dear 1
lady 1
and 1
your 1
cousin 1
Thus 1
the 1
poor 1
sufferer 1
tried 1
to 1
comfort 1
others 1
and 1
herself 1
She 1
indeed 1
gained 1
the 1
resignation 1
she 1
desired 1
But 1
I 1
the 1
true 1
murderer 1
felt 1
the 1
never 1
dying 1
worm 1
alive 1
in 1
my 1
bosom 1
which 1
allowed 1
of 1
no 1
hope 1
or 1
consolation 1
Elizabeth 1
also 1
wept 1
and 1
was 1
unhappy 1
but 1
hers 1
also 1
was 1
the 1
misery 1
of 1
innocence 1
which 1
like 1
a 1
cloud 1
that 1
passes 1
over 1
the 1
fair 1
moon 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
hides 1
but 1
cannot 1
tarnish 1
its 1
brightness 1
Anguish 1
and 1
despair 1
had 1
penetrated 1
into 1
the 1
core 1
of 1
my 1
heart 1
I 1
bore 1
a 1
hell 1
within 1
me 1
which 1
nothing 1
could 1
extinguish 1
We 1
stayed 1
several 1
hours 1
with 1
Justine 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
great 1
difficulty 1
that 1
Elizabeth 1
could 1
tear 1
herself 1
away 1
I 1
wish 1
cried 1
she 1
that 1
I 1
were 1
to 1
die 1
with 1
you 1
I 1
cannot 1
live 1
in 1
this 1
world 1
of 1
misery 1
Justine 1
assumed 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
cheerfulness 1
while 1
she 1
with 1
difficulty 1
repressed 1
her 1
bitter 1
tears 1
She 1
embraced 1
Elizabeth 1
and 1
said 1
in 1
a 1
voice 1
of 1
half 1
suppressed 1
emotion 1
Farewell 1
sweet 1
lady 1
dearest 1
Elizabeth 1
my 1
beloved 1
and 1
only 1
friend 1
may 1
heaven 1
in 1
its 1
bounty 1
bless 1
and 1
preserve 1
you 1
may 1
this 1
be 1
the 1
last 1
misfortune 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
ever 1
suffer 1
Live 1
and 1
be 1
happy 1
and 1
make 1
others 1
so 1
And 1
on 1
the 1
morrow 1
Justine 1
died 1
Elizabeth 1
s 1
heart 1
rending 1
eloquence 1
failed 1
to 1
move 1
the 1
judges 1
from 1
their 1
settled 1
conviction 1
in 1
the 1
criminality 1
of 1
the 1
saintly 1
sufferer 1
My 1
passionate 1
and 1
indignant 1
appeals 1
were 1
lost 1
upon 1
them 1
And 1
when 1
I 1
received 1
their 1
cold 1
answers 1
and 1
heard 1
the 1
harsh 1
unfeeling 1
reasoning 1
of 1
these 1
men 1
my 1
purposed 1
avowal 1
died 1
away 1
on 1
my 1
lips 1
Thus 1
I 1
might 1
proclaim 1
myself 1
a 1
madman 1
but 1
not 1
revoke 1
the 1
sentence 1
passed 1
upon 1
my 1
wretched 1
victim 1
She 1
perished 1
on 1
the 1
scaffold 1
as 1
a 1
murderess 1
From 1
the 1
tortures 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
heart 1
I 1
turned 1
to 1
contemplate 1
the 1
deep 1
and 1
voiceless 1
grief 1
of 1
my 1
Elizabeth 1
This 1
also 1
was 1
my 1
doing 1
And 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
woe 1
and 1
the 1
desolation 1
of 1
that 1
late 1
so 1
smiling 1
home 1
all 1
was 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
my 1
thrice 1
accursed 1
hands 1
Ye 1
weep 1
unhappy 1
ones 1
but 1
these 1
are 1
not 1
your 1
last 1
tears 1
Again 1
shall 1
you 1
raise 1
the 1
funeral 1
wail 1
and 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
your 1
lamentations 1
shall 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
be 1
heard 1
Frankenstein 1
your 1
son 1
your 1
kinsman 1
your 1
early 1
much 1
loved 1
friend 1
he 1
who 1
would 1
spend 1
each 1
vital 1
drop 1
of 1
blood 1
for 1
your 1
sakes 1
who 1
has 1
no 1
thought 1
nor 1
sense 1
of 1
joy 1
except 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
mirrored 1
also 1
in 1
your 1
dear 1
countenances 1
who 1
would 1
fill 1
the 1
air 1
with 1
blessings 1
and 1
spend 1
his 1
life 1
in 1
serving 1
you 1
he 1
bids 1
you 1
weep 1
to 1
shed 1
countless 1
tears 1
happy 1
beyond 1
his 1
hopes 1
if 1
thus 1
inexorable 1
fate 1
be 1
satisfied 1
and 1
if 1
the 1
destruction 1
pause 1
before 1
the 1
peace 1
of 1
the 1
grave 1
have 1
succeeded 1
to 1
your 1
sad 1
torments 1
Thus 1
spoke 1
my 1
prophetic 1
soul 1
as 1
torn 1
by 1
remorse 1
horror 1
and 1
despair 1
I 1
beheld 1
those 1
I 1
loved 1
spend 1
vain 1
sorrow 1
upon 1
the 1
graves 1
of 1
William 1
and 1
Justine 1
the 1
first 1
hapless 1
victims 1
to 1
my 1
unhallowed 1
arts 1
Chapter 1
Nothing 1
is 1
more 1
painful 1
to 1
the 1
human 1
mind 1
than 1
after 1
the 1
feelings 1
have 1
been 1
worked 1
up 1
by 1
a 1
quick 1
succession 1
of 1
events 1
the 1
dead 1
calmness 1
of 1
inaction 1
and 1
certainty 1
which 1
follows 1
and 1
deprives 1
the 1
soul 1
both 1
of 1
hope 1
and 1
fear 1
Justine 1
died 1
she 1
rested 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
alive 1
The 1
blood 1
flowed 1
freely 1
in 1
my 1
veins 1
but 1
a 1
weight 1
of 1
despair 1
and 1
remorse 1
pressed 1
on 1
my 1
heart 1
which 1
nothing 1
could 1
remove 1
Sleep 1
fled 1
from 1
my 1
eyes 1
I 1
wandered 1
like 1
an 1
evil 1
spirit 1
for 1
I 1
had 1
committed 1
deeds 1
of 1
mischief 1
beyond 1
description 1
horrible 1
and 1
more 1
much 1
more 1
I 1
persuaded 1
myself 1
was 1
yet 1
behind 1
Yet 1
my 1
heart 1
overflowed 1
with 1
kindness 1
and 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
virtue 1
I 1
had 1
begun 1
life 1
with 1
benevolent 1
intentions 1
and 1
thirsted 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
when 1
I 1
should 1
put 1
them 1
in 1
practice 1
and 1
make 1
myself 1
useful 1
to 1
my 1
fellow 1
beings 1
Now 1
all 1
was 1
blasted 1
instead 1
of 1
that 1
serenity 1
of 1
conscience 1
which 1
allowed 1
me 1
to 1
look 1
back 1
upon 1
the 1
past 1
with 1
self 1
satisfaction 1
and 1
from 1
thence 1
to 1
gather 1
promise 1
of 1
new 1
hopes 1
I 1
was 1
seized 1
by 1
remorse 1
and 1
the 1
sense 1
of 1
guilt 1
which 1
hurried 1
me 1
away 1
to 1
a 1
hell 1
of 1
intense 1
tortures 1
such 1
as 1
no 1
language 1
can 1
describe 1
This 1
state 1
of 1
mind 1
preyed 1
upon 1
my 1
health 1
which 1
had 1
perhaps 1
never 1
entirely 1
recovered 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
shock 1
it 1
had 1
sustained 1
I 1
shunned 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
man 1
all 1
sound 1
of 1
joy 1
or 1
complacency 1
was 1
torture 1
to 1
me 1
solitude 1
was 1
my 1
only 1
consolation 1
deep 1
dark 1
deathlike 1
solitude 1
My 1
father 1
observed 1
with 1
pain 1
the 1
alteration 1
perceptible 1
in 1
my 1
disposition 1
and 1
habits 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
by 1
arguments 1
deduced 1
from 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
his 1
serene 1
conscience 1
and 1
guiltless 1
life 1
to 1
inspire 1
me 1
with 1
fortitude 1
and 1
awaken 1
in 1
me 1
the 1
courage 1
to 1
dispel 1
the 1
dark 1
cloud 1
which 1
brooded 1
over 1
me 1
Do 1
you 1
think 1
Victor 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
suffer 1
also 1
No 1
one 1
could 1
love 1
a 1
child 1
more 1
than 1
I 1
loved 1
your 1
brother 1
tears 1
came 1
into 1
his 1
eyes 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
but 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
a 1
duty 1
to 1
the 1
survivors 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
refrain 1
from 1
augmenting 1
their 1
unhappiness 1
by 1
an 1
appearance 1
of 1
immoderate 1
grief 1
It 1
is 1
also 1
a 1
duty 1
owed 1
to 1
yourself 1
for 1
excessive 1
sorrow 1
prevents 1
improvement 1
or 1
enjoyment 1
or 1
even 1
the 1
discharge 1
of 1
daily 1
usefulness 1
without 1
which 1
no 1
man 1
is 1
fit 1
for 1
society 1
This 1
advice 1
although 1
good 1
was 1
totally 1
inapplicable 1
to 1
my 1
case 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
first 1
to 1
hide 1
my 1
grief 1
and 1
console 1
my 1
friends 1
if 1
remorse 1
had 1
not 1
mingled 1
its 1
bitterness 1
and 1
terror 1
its 1
alarm 1
with 1
my 1
other 1
sensations 1
Now 1
I 1
could 1
only 1
answer 1
my 1
father 1
with 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
despair 1
and 1
endeavour 1
to 1
hide 1
myself 1
from 1
his 1
view 1
About 1
this 1
time 1
we 1
retired 1
to 1
our 1
house 1
at 1
Belrive 1
This 1
change 1
was 1
particularly 1
agreeable 1
to 1
me 1
The 1
shutting 1
of 1
the 1
gates 1
regularly 1
at 1
ten 1
o 1
clock 1
and 1
the 1
impossibility 1
of 1
remaining 1
on 1
the 1
lake 1
after 1
that 1
hour 1
had 1
rendered 1
our 1
residence 1
within 1
the 1
walls 1
of 1
Geneva 1
very 1
irksome 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
was 1
now 1
free 1
Often 1
after 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
had 1
retired 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
I 1
took 1
the 1
boat 1
and 1
passed 1
many 1
hours 1
upon 1
the 1
water 1
Sometimes 1
with 1
my 1
sails 1
set 1
I 1
was 1
carried 1
by 1
the 1
wind 1
and 1
sometimes 1
after 1
rowing 1
into 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
I 1
left 1
the 1
boat 1
to 1
pursue 1
its 1
own 1
course 1
and 1
gave 1
way 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
miserable 1
reflections 1
I 1
was 1
often 1
tempted 1
when 1
all 1
was 1
at 1
peace 1
around 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
the 1
only 1
unquiet 1
thing 1
that 1
wandered 1
restless 1
in 1
a 1
scene 1
so 1
beautiful 1
and 1
heavenly 1
if 1
I 1
except 1
some 1
bat 1
or 1
the 1
frogs 1
whose 1
harsh 1
and 1
interrupted 1
croaking 1
was 1
heard 1
only 1
when 1
I 1
approached 1
the 1
shore 1
often 1
I 1
say 1
I 1
was 1
tempted 1
to 1
plunge 1
into 1
the 1
silent 1
lake 1
that 1
the 1
waters 1
might 1
close 1
over 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
calamities 1
forever 1
But 1
I 1
was 1
restrained 1
when 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
heroic 1
and 1
suffering 1
Elizabeth 1
whom 1
I 1
tenderly 1
loved 1
and 1
whose 1
existence 1
was 1
bound 1
up 1
in 1
mine 1
I 1
thought 1
also 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
surviving 1
brother 1
should 1
I 1
by 1
my 1
base 1
desertion 1
leave 1
them 1
exposed 1
and 1
unprotected 1
to 1
the 1
malice 1
of 1
the 1
fiend 1
whom 1
I 1
had 1
let 1
loose 1
among 1
them 1
At 1
these 1
moments 1
I 1
wept 1
bitterly 1
and 1
wished 1
that 1
peace 1
would 1
revisit 1
my 1
mind 1
only 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
afford 1
them 1
consolation 1
and 1
happiness 1
But 1
that 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
Remorse 1
extinguished 1
every 1
hope 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
author 1
of 1
unalterable 1
evils 1
and 1
I 1
lived 1
in 1
daily 1
fear 1
lest 1
the 1
monster 1
whom 1
I 1
had 1
created 1
should 1
perpetrate 1
some 1
new 1
wickedness 1
I 1
had 1
an 1
obscure 1
feeling 1
that 1
all 1
was 1
not 1
over 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
still 1
commit 1
some 1
signal 1
crime 1
which 1
by 1
its 1
enormity 1
should 1
almost 1
efface 1
the 1
recollection 1
of 1
the 1
past 1
There 1
was 1
always 1
scope 1
for 1
fear 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
anything 1
I 1
loved 1
remained 1
behind 1
My 1
abhorrence 1
of 1
this 1
fiend 1
cannot 1
be 1
conceived 1
When 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
him 1
I 1
gnashed 1
my 1
teeth 1
my 1
eyes 1
became 1
inflamed 1
and 1
I 1
ardently 1
wished 1
to 1
extinguish 1
that 1
life 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
so 1
thoughtlessly 1
bestowed 1
When 1
I 1
reflected 1
on 1
his 1
crimes 1
and 1
malice 1
my 1
hatred 1
and 1
revenge 1
burst 1
all 1
bounds 1
of 1
moderation 1
I 1
would 1
have 1
made 1
a 1
pilgrimage 1
to 1
the 1
highest 1
peak 1
of 1
the 1
Andes 1
could 1
I 1
when 1
there 1
have 1
precipitated 1
him 1
to 1
their 1
base 1
I 1
wished 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
again 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
wreak 1
the 1
utmost 1
extent 1
of 1
abhorrence 1
on 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
avenge 1
the 1
deaths 1
of 1
William 1
and 1
Justine 1
Our 1
house 1
was 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
mourning 1
My 1
father 1
s 1
health 1
was 1
deeply 1
shaken 1
by 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
the 1
recent 1
events 1
Elizabeth 1
was 1
sad 1
and 1
desponding 1
she 1
no 1
longer 1
took 1
delight 1
in 1
her 1
ordinary 1
occupations 1
all 1
pleasure 1
seemed 1
to 1
her 1
sacrilege 1
toward 1
the 1
dead 1
eternal 1
woe 1
and 1
tears 1
she 1
then 1
thought 1
was 1
the 1
just 1
tribute 1
she 1
should 1
pay 1
to 1
innocence 1
so 1
blasted 1
and 1
destroyed 1
She 1
was 1
no 1
longer 1
that 1
happy 1
creature 1
who 1
in 1
earlier 1
youth 1
wandered 1
with 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
banks 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
and 1
talked 1
with 1
ecstasy 1
of 1
our 1
future 1
prospects 1
The 1
first 1
of 1
those 1
sorrows 1
which 1
are 1
sent 1
to 1
wean 1
us 1
from 1
the 1
earth 1
had 1
visited 1
her 1
and 1
its 1
dimming 1
influence 1
quenched 1
her 1
dearest 1
smiles 1
When 1
I 1
reflect 1
my 1
dear 1
cousin 1
said 1
she 1
on 1
the 1
miserable 1
death 1
of 1
Justine 1
Moritz 1
I 1
no 1
longer 1
see 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
its 1
works 1
as 1
they 1
before 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
Before 1
I 1
looked 1
upon 1
the 1
accounts 1
of 1
vice 1
and 1
injustice 1
that 1
I 1
read 1
in 1
books 1
or 1
heard 1
from 1
others 1
as 1
tales 1
of 1
ancient 1
days 1
or 1
imaginary 1
evils 1
at 1
least 1
they 1
were 1
remote 1
and 1
more 1
familiar 1
to 1
reason 1
than 1
to 1
the 1
imagination 1
but 1
now 1
misery 1
has 1
come 1
home 1
and 1
men 1
appear 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
monsters 1
thirsting 1
for 1
each 1
other 1
s 1
blood 1
Yet 1
I 1
am 1
certainly 1
unjust 1
Everybody 1
believed 1
that 1
poor 1
girl 1
to 1
be 1
guilty 1
and 1
if 1
she 1
could 1
have 1
committed 1
the 1
crime 1
for 1
which 1
she 1
suffered 1
assuredly 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
most 1
depraved 1
of 1
human 1
creatures 1
For 1
the 1
sake 1
of 1
a 1
few 1
jewels 1
to 1
have 1
murdered 1
the 1
son 1
of 1
her 1
benefactor 1
and 1
friend 1
a 1
child 1
whom 1
she 1
had 1
nursed 1
from 1
its 1
birth 1
and 1
appeared 1
to 1
love 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
her 1
own 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
consent 1
to 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
any 1
human 1
being 1
but 1
certainly 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
thought 1
such 1
a 1
creature 1
unfit 1
to 1
remain 1
in 1
the 1
society 1
of 1
men 1
But 1
she 1
was 1
innocent 1
I 1
know 1
I 1
feel 1
she 1
was 1
innocent 1
you 1
are 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
opinion 1
and 1
that 1
confirms 1
me 1
Alas 1
Victor 1
when 1
falsehood 1
can 1
look 1
so 1
like 1
the 1
truth 1
who 1
can 1
assure 1
themselves 1
of 1
certain 1
happiness 1
I 1
feel 1
as 1
if 1
I 1
were 1
walking 1
on 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
a 1
precipice 1
towards 1
which 1
thousands 1
are 1
crowding 1
and 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
plunge 1
me 1
into 1
the 1
abyss 1
William 1
and 1
Justine 1
were 1
assassinated 1
and 1
the 1
murderer 1
escapes 1
he 1
walks 1
about 1
the 1
world 1
free 1
and 1
perhaps 1
respected 1
But 1
even 1
if 1
I 1
were 1
condemned 1
to 1
suffer 1
on 1
the 1
scaffold 1
for 1
the 1
same 1
crimes 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
change 1
places 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
wretch 1
I 1
listened 1
to 1
this 1
discourse 1
with 1
the 1
extremest 1
agony 1
I 1
not 1
in 1
deed 1
but 1
in 1
effect 1
was 1
the 1
true 1
murderer 1
Elizabeth 1
read 1
my 1
anguish 1
in 1
my 1
countenance 1
and 1
kindly 1
taking 1
my 1
hand 1
said 1
My 1
dearest 1
friend 1
you 1
must 1
calm 1
yourself 1
These 1
events 1
have 1
affected 1
me 1
God 1
knows 1
how 1
deeply 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
so 1
wretched 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
There 1
is 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
despair 1
and 1
sometimes 1
of 1
revenge 1
in 1
your 1
countenance 1
that 1
makes 1
me 1
tremble 1
Dear 1
Victor 1
banish 1
these 1
dark 1
passions 1
Remember 1
the 1
friends 1
around 1
you 1
who 1
centre 1
all 1
their 1
hopes 1
in 1
you 1
Have 1
we 1
lost 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
rendering 1
you 1
happy 1
Ah 1
While 1
we 1
love 1
while 1
we 1
are 1
true 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
here 1
in 1
this 1
land 1
of 1
peace 1
and 1
beauty 1
your 1
native 1
country 1
we 1
may 1
reap 1
every 1
tranquil 1
blessing 1
what 1
can 1
disturb 1
our 1
peace 1
And 1
could 1
not 1
such 1
words 1
from 1
her 1
whom 1
I 1
fondly 1
prized 1
before 1
every 1
other 1
gift 1
of 1
fortune 1
suffice 1
to 1
chase 1
away 1
the 1
fiend 1
that 1
lurked 1
in 1
my 1
heart 1
Even 1
as 1
she 1
spoke 1
I 1
drew 1
near 1
to 1
her 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
terror 1
lest 1
at 1
that 1
very 1
moment 1
the 1
destroyer 1
had 1
been 1
near 1
to 1
rob 1
me 1
of 1
her 1
Thus 1
not 1
the 1
tenderness 1
of 1
friendship 1
nor 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
earth 1
nor 1
of 1
heaven 1
could 1
redeem 1
my 1
soul 1
from 1
woe 1
the 1
very 1
accents 1
of 1
love 1
were 1
ineffectual 1
I 1
was 1
encompassed 1
by 1
a 1
cloud 1
which 1
no 1
beneficial 1
influence 1
could 1
penetrate 1
The 1
wounded 1
deer 1
dragging 1
its 1
fainting 1
limbs 1
to 1
some 1
untrodden 1
brake 1
there 1
to 1
gaze 1
upon 1
the 1
arrow 1
which 1
had 1
pierced 1
it 1
and 1
to 1
die 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
type 1
of 1
me 1
Sometimes 1
I 1
could 1
cope 1
with 1
the 1
sullen 1
despair 1
that 1
overwhelmed 1
me 1
but 1
sometimes 1
the 1
whirlwind 1
passions 1
of 1
my 1
soul 1
drove 1
me 1
to 1
seek 1
by 1
bodily 1
exercise 1
and 1
by 1
change 1
of 1
place 1
some 1
relief 1
from 1
my 1
intolerable 1
sensations 1
It 1
was 1
during 1
an 1
access 1
of 1
this 1
kind 1
that 1
I 1
suddenly 1
left 1
my 1
home 1
and 1
bending 1
my 1
steps 1
towards 1
the 1
near 1
Alpine 1
valleys 1
sought 1
in 1
the 1
magnificence 1
the 1
eternity 1
of 1
such 1
scenes 1
to 1
forget 1
myself 1
and 1
my 1
ephemeral 1
because 1
human 1
sorrows 1
My 1
wanderings 1
were 1
directed 1
towards 1
the 1
valley 1
of 1
Chamounix 1
I 1
had 1
visited 1
it 1
frequently 1
during 1
my 1
boyhood 1
Six 1
years 1
had 1
passed 1
since 1
then 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
wreck 1
but 1
nought 1
had 1
changed 1
in 1
those 1
savage 1
and 1
enduring 1
scenes 1
I 1
performed 1
the 1
first 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
journey 1
on 1
horseback 1
I 1
afterwards 1
hired 1
a 1
mule 1
as 1
the 1
more 1
sure 1
footed 1
and 1
least 1
liable 1
to 1
receive 1
injury 1
on 1
these 1
rugged 1
roads 1
The 1
weather 1
was 1
fine 1
it 1
was 1
about 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
month 1
of 1
August 1
nearly 1
two 1
months 1
after 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
Justine 1
that 1
miserable 1
epoch 1
from 1
which 1
I 1
dated 1
all 1
my 1
woe 1
The 1
weight 1
upon 1
my 1
spirit 1
was 1
sensibly 1
lightened 1
as 1
I 1
plunged 1
yet 1
deeper 1
in 1
the 1
ravine 1
of 1
Arve 1
The 1
immense 1
mountains 1
and 1
precipices 1
that 1
overhung 1
me 1
on 1
every 1
side 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
raging 1
among 1
the 1
rocks 1
and 1
the 1
dashing 1
of 1
the 1
waterfalls 1
around 1
spoke 1
of 1
a 1
power 1
mighty 1
as 1
Omnipotence 1
and 1
I 1
ceased 1
to 1
fear 1
or 1
to 1
bend 1
before 1
any 1
being 1
less 1
almighty 1
than 1
that 1
which 1
had 1
created 1
and 1
ruled 1
the 1
elements 1
here 1
displayed 1
in 1
their 1
most 1
terrific 1
guise 1
Still 1
as 1
I 1
ascended 1
higher 1
the 1
valley 1
assumed 1
a 1
more 1
magnificent 1
and 1
astonishing 1
character 1
Ruined 1
castles 1
hanging 1
on 1
the 1
precipices 1
of 1
piny 1
mountains 1
the 1
impetuous 1
Arve 1
and 1
cottages 1
every 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
peeping 1
forth 1
from 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
formed 1
a 1
scene 1
of 1
singular 1
beauty 1
But 1
it 1
was 1
augmented 1
and 1
rendered 1
sublime 1
by 1
the 1
mighty 1
Alps 1
whose 1
white 1
and 1
shining 1
pyramids 1
and 1
domes 1
towered 1
above 1
all 1
as 1
belonging 1
to 1
another 1
earth 1
the 1
habitations 1
of 1
another 1
race 1
of 1
beings 1
I 1
passed 1
the 1
bridge 1
of 1
Pelissier 1
where 1
the 1
ravine 1
which 1
the 1
river 1
forms 1
opened 1
before 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
began 1
to 1
ascend 1
the 1
mountain 1
that 1
overhangs 1
it 1
Soon 1
after 1
I 1
entered 1
the 1
valley 1
of 1
Chamounix 1
This 1
valley 1
is 1
more 1
wonderful 1
and 1
sublime 1
but 1
not 1
so 1
beautiful 1
and 1
picturesque 1
as 1
that 1
of 1
Servox 1
through 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
just 1
passed 1
The 1
high 1
and 1
snowy 1
mountains 1
were 1
its 1
immediate 1
boundaries 1
but 1
I 1
saw 1
no 1
more 1
ruined 1
castles 1
and 1
fertile 1
fields 1
Immense 1
glaciers 1
approached 1
the 1
road 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
rumbling 1
thunder 1
of 1
the 1
falling 1
avalanche 1
and 1
marked 1
the 1
smoke 1
of 1
its 1
passage 1
Mont 1
Blanc 1
the 1
supreme 1
and 1
magnificent 1
Mont 1
Blanc 1
raised 1
itself 1
from 1
the 1
surrounding 1
aiguilles 1
and 1
its 1
tremendous 1
dome 1
overlooked 1
the 1
valley 1
A 1
tingling 1
long 1
lost 1
sense 1
of 1
pleasure 1
often 1
came 1
across 1
me 1
during 1
this 1
journey 1
Some 1
turn 1
in 1
the 1
road 1
some 1
new 1
object 1
suddenly 1
perceived 1
and 1
recognized 1
reminded 1
me 1
of 1
days 1
gone 1
by 1
and 1
were 1
associated 1
with 1
the 1
lighthearted 1
gaiety 1
of 1
boyhood 1
The 1
very 1
winds 1
whispered 1
in 1
soothing 1
accents 1
and 1
maternal 1
Nature 1
bade 1
me 1
weep 1
no 1
more 1
Then 1
again 1
the 1
kindly 1
influence 1
ceased 1
to 1
act 1
I 1
found 1
myself 1
fettered 1
again 1
to 1
grief 1
and 1
indulging 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
misery 1
of 1
reflection 1
Then 1
I 1
spurred 1
on 1
my 1
animal 1
striving 1
so 1
to 1
forget 1
the 1
world 1
my 1
fears 1
and 1
more 1
than 1
all 1
myself 1
or 1
in 1
a 1
more 1
desperate 1
fashion 1
I 1
alighted 1
and 1
threw 1
myself 1
on 1
the 1
grass 1
weighed 1
down 1
by 1
horror 1
and 1
despair 1
At 1
length 1
I 1
arrived 1
at 1
the 1
village 1
of 1
Chamounix 1
Exhaustion 1
succeeded 1
to 1
the 1
extreme 1
fatigue 1
both 1
of 1
body 1
and 1
of 1
mind 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
endured 1
For 1
a 1
short 1
space 1
of 1
time 1
I 1
remained 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
watching 1
the 1
pallid 1
lightnings 1
that 1
played 1
above 1
Mont 1
Blanc 1
and 1
listening 1
to 1
the 1
rushing 1
of 1
the 1
Arve 1
which 1
pursued 1
its 1
noisy 1
way 1
beneath 1
The 1
same 1
lulling 1
sounds 1
acted 1
as 1
a 1
lullaby 1
to 1
my 1
too 1
keen 1
sensations 1
when 1
I 1
placed 1
my 1
head 1
upon 1
my 1
pillow 1
sleep 1
crept 1
over 1
me 1
I 1
felt 1
it 1
as 1
it 1
came 1
and 1
blessed 1
the 1
giver 1
of 1
oblivion 1
Chapter 1
I 1
spent 1
the 1
following 1
day 1
roaming 1
through 1
the 1
valley 1
I 1
stood 1
beside 1
the 1
sources 1
of 1
the 1
Arveiron 1
which 1
take 1
their 1
rise 1
in 1
a 1
glacier 1
that 1
with 1
slow 1
pace 1
is 1
advancing 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
summit 1
of 1
the 1
hills 1
to 1
barricade 1
the 1
valley 1
The 1
abrupt 1
sides 1
of 1
vast 1
mountains 1
were 1
before 1
me 1
the 1
icy 1
wall 1
of 1
the 1
glacier 1
overhung 1
me 1
a 1
few 1
shattered 1
pines 1
were 1
scattered 1
around 1
and 1
the 1
solemn 1
silence 1
of 1
this 1
glorious 1
presence 1
chamber 1
of 1
imperial 1
nature 1
was 1
broken 1
only 1
by 1
the 1
brawling 1
waves 1
or 1
the 1
fall 1
of 1
some 1
vast 1
fragment 1
the 1
thunder 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
avalanche 1
or 1
the 1
cracking 1
reverberated 1
along 1
the 1
mountains 1
of 1
the 1
accumulated 1
ice 1
which 1
through 1
the 1
silent 1
working 1
of 1
immutable 1
laws 1
was 1
ever 1
and 1
anon 1
rent 1
and 1
torn 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
but 1
a 1
plaything 1
in 1
their 1
hands 1
These 1
sublime 1
and 1
magnificent 1
scenes 1
afforded 1
me 1
the 1
greatest 1
consolation 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
capable 1
of 1
receiving 1
They 1
elevated 1
me 1
from 1
all 1
littleness 1
of 1
feeling 1
and 1
although 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
remove 1
my 1
grief 1
they 1
subdued 1
and 1
tranquillized 1
it 1
In 1
some 1
degree 1
also 1
they 1
diverted 1
my 1
mind 1
from 1
the 1
thoughts 1
over 1
which 1
it 1
had 1
brooded 1
for 1
the 1
last 1
month 1
I 1
retired 1
to 1
rest 1
at 1
night 1
my 1
slumbers 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
waited 1
on 1
and 1
ministered 1
to 1
by 1
the 1
assemblance 1
of 1
grand 1
shapes 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
contemplated 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
They 1
congregated 1
round 1
me 1
the 1
unstained 1
snowy 1
mountain 1
top 1
the 1
glittering 1
pinnacle 1
the 1
pine 1
woods 1
and 1
ragged 1
bare 1
ravine 1
the 1
eagle 1
soaring 1
amidst 1
the 1
clouds 1
they 1
all 1
gathered 1
round 1
me 1
and 1
bade 1
me 1
be 1
at 1
peace 1
Where 1
had 1
they 1
fled 1
when 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
I 1
awoke 1
All 1
of 1
soul 1
inspiriting 1
fled 1
with 1
sleep 1
and 1
dark 1
melancholy 1
clouded 1
every 1
thought 1
The 1
rain 1
was 1
pouring 1
in 1
torrents 1
and 1
thick 1
mists 1
hid 1
the 1
summits 1
of 1
the 1
mountains 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
even 1
saw 1
not 1
the 1
faces 1
of 1
those 1
mighty 1
friends 1
Still 1
I 1
would 1
penetrate 1
their 1
misty 1
veil 1
and 1
seek 1
them 1
in 1
their 1
cloudy 1
retreats 1
What 1
were 1
rain 1
and 1
storm 1
to 1
me 1
My 1
mule 1
was 1
brought 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
I 1
resolved 1
to 1
ascend 1
to 1
the 1
summit 1
of 1
Montanvert 1
I 1
remembered 1
the 1
effect 1
that 1
the 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
tremendous 1
and 1
ever 1
moving 1
glacier 1
had 1
produced 1
upon 1
my 1
mind 1
when 1
I 1
first 1
saw 1
it 1
It 1
had 1
then 1
filled 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
sublime 1
ecstasy 1
that 1
gave 1
wings 1
to 1
the 1
soul 1
and 1
allowed 1
it 1
to 1
soar 1
from 1
the 1
obscure 1
world 1
to 1
light 1
and 1
joy 1
The 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
awful 1
and 1
majestic 1
in 1
nature 1
had 1
indeed 1
always 1
the 1
effect 1
of 1
solemnizing 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
causing 1
me 1
to 1
forget 1
the 1
passing 1
cares 1
of 1
life 1
I 1
determined 1
to 1
go 1
without 1
a 1
guide 1
for 1
I 1
was 1
well 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
path 1
and 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
another 1
would 1
destroy 1
the 1
solitary 1
grandeur 1
of 1
the 1
scene 1
The 1
ascent 1
is 1
precipitous 1
but 1
the 1
path 1
is 1
cut 1
into 1
continual 1
and 1
short 1
windings 1
which 1
enable 1
you 1
to 1
surmount 1
the 1
perpendicularity 1
of 1
the 1
mountain 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
scene 1
terrifically 1
desolate 1
In 1
a 1
thousand 1
spots 1
the 1
traces 1
of 1
the 1
winter 1
avalanche 1
may 1
be 1
perceived 1
where 1
trees 1
lie 1
broken 1
and 1
strewed 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
some 1
entirely 1
destroyed 1
others 1
bent 1
leaning 1
upon 1
the 1
jutting 1
rocks 1
of 1
the 1
mountain 1
or 1
transversely 1
upon 1
other 1
trees 1
The 1
path 1
as 1
you 1
ascend 1
higher 1
is 1
intersected 1
by 1
ravines 1
of 1
snow 1
down 1
which 1
stones 1
continually 1
roll 1
from 1
above 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
is 1
particularly 1
dangerous 1
as 1
the 1
slightest 1
sound 1
such 1
as 1
even 1
speaking 1
in 1
a 1
loud 1
voice 1
produces 1
a 1
concussion 1
of 1
air 1
sufficient 1
to 1
draw 1
destruction 1
upon 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
speaker 1
The 1
pines 1
are 1
not 1
tall 1
or 1
luxuriant 1
but 1
they 1
are 1
sombre 1
and 1
add 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
severity 1
to 1
the 1
scene 1
I 1
looked 1
on 1
the 1
valley 1
beneath 1
vast 1
mists 1
were 1
rising 1
from 1
the 1
rivers 1
which 1
ran 1
through 1
it 1
and 1
curling 1
in 1
thick 1
wreaths 1
around 1
the 1
opposite 1
mountains 1
whose 1
summits 1
were 1
hid 1
in 1
the 1
uniform 1
clouds 1
while 1
rain 1
poured 1
from 1
the 1
dark 1
sky 1
and 1
added 1
to 1
the 1
melancholy 1
impression 1
I 1
received 1
from 1
the 1
objects 1
around 1
me 1
Alas 1
Why 1
does 1
man 1
boast 1
of 1
sensibilities 1
superior 1
to 1
those 1
apparent 1
in 1
the 1
brute 1
it 1
only 1
renders 1
them 1
more 1
necessary 1
beings 1
If 1
our 1
impulses 1
were 1
confined 1
to 1
hunger 1
thirst 1
and 1
desire 1
we 1
might 1
be 1
nearly 1
free 1
but 1
now 1
we 1
are 1
moved 1
by 1
every 1
wind 1
that 1
blows 1
and 1
a 1
chance 1
word 1
or 1
scene 1
that 2
word 1
may 1
convey 1
to 1
us 1
We 1
rest 1
a 1
dream 1
has 1
power 1
to 1
poison 1
sleep 1
We 1
rise 1
one 1
wand 1
ring 1
thought 1
pollutes 1
the 1
day 1
We 1
feel 1
conceive 1
or 1
reason 1
laugh 1
or 1
weep 1
Embrace 1
fond 1
woe 1
or 1
cast 1
our 1
cares 1
away 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
same 1
for 1
be 1
it 1
joy 1
or 1
sorrow 1
The 1
path 1
of 1
its 1
departure 1
still 1
is 1
free 1
Man 1
s 1
yesterday 1
may 1
ne 1
er 1
be 1
like 1
his 1
morrow 1
Nought 1
may 1
endure 1
but 1
mutability 1
It 1
was 1
nearly 1
noon 1
when 1
I 1
arrived 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
ascent 1
For 1
some 1
time 1
I 1
sat 1
upon 1
the 1
rock 1
that 1
overlooks 1
the 1
sea 1
of 1
ice 1
A 1
mist 1
covered 1
both 1
that 1
and 1
the 1
surrounding 1
mountains 1
Presently 1
a 1
breeze 1
dissipated 1
the 1
cloud 1
and 1
I 1
descended 1
upon 1
the 1
glacier 1
The 1
surface 1
is 1
very 1
uneven 1
rising 1
like 1
the 1
waves 1
of 1
a 1
troubled 1
sea 1
descending 1
low 1
and 1
interspersed 1
by 1
rifts 1
that 1
sink 1
deep 1
The 1
field 1
of 1
ice 1
is 1
almost 1
a 1
league 1
in 1
width 1
but 1
I 1
spent 1
nearly 1
two 1
hours 1
in 1
crossing 1
it 1
The 1
opposite 1
mountain 1
is 1
a 1
bare 1
perpendicular 1
rock 1
From 1
the 1
side 1
where 1
I 1
now 1
stood 1
Montanvert 1
was 1
exactly 1
opposite 1
at 1
the 1
distance 1
of 1
a 1
league 1
and 1
above 1
it 1
rose 1
Mont 1
Blanc 1
in 1
awful 1
majesty 1
I 1
remained 1
in 1
a 1
recess 1
of 1
the 1
rock 1
gazing 1
on 1
this 1
wonderful 1
and 1
stupendous 1
scene 1
The 1
sea 1
or 1
rather 1
the 1
vast 1
river 1
of 1
ice 1
wound 1
among 1
its 1
dependent 1
mountains 1
whose 1
aerial 1
summits 1
hung 1
over 1
its 1
recesses 1
Their 1
icy 1
and 1
glittering 1
peaks 1
shone 1
in 1
the 1
sunlight 1
over 1
the 1
clouds 1
My 1
heart 1
which 1
was 1
before 1
sorrowful 1
now 1
swelled 1
with 1
something 1
like 1
joy 1
I 1
exclaimed 1
Wandering 1
spirits 1
if 1
indeed 1
ye 1
wander 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
rest 1
in 1
your 1
narrow 1
beds 1
allow 1
me 1
this 1
faint 1
happiness 1
or 1
take 1
me 1
as 1
your 1
companion 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
joys 1
of 1
life 1
As 1
I 1
said 1
this 1
I 1
suddenly 1
beheld 1
the 1
figure 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
at 1
some 1
distance 1
advancing 1
towards 1
me 1
with 1
superhuman 1
speed 1
He 1
bounded 1
over 1
the 1
crevices 1
in 1
the 1
ice 1
among 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
walked 1
with 1
caution 1
his 1
stature 1
also 1
as 1
he 1
approached 1
seemed 1
to 1
exceed 1
that 1
of 1
man 1
I 1
was 1
troubled 1
a 1
mist 1
came 1
over 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
I 1
felt 1
a 1
faintness 1
seize 1
me 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
quickly 1
restored 1
by 1
the 1
cold 1
gale 1
of 1
the 1
mountains 1
I 1
perceived 1
as 1
the 1
shape 1
came 1
nearer 1
sight 1
tremendous 1
and 1
abhorred 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
wretch 1
whom 1
I 1
had 1
created 1
I 1
trembled 1
with 1
rage 1
and 1
horror 1
resolving 1
to 1
wait 1
his 1
approach 1
and 1
then 1
close 1
with 1
him 1
in 1
mortal 1
combat 1
He 1
approached 1
his 1
countenance 1
bespoke 1
bitter 1
anguish 1
combined 1
with 1
disdain 1
and 1
malignity 1
while 1
its 1
unearthly 1
ugliness 1
rendered 1
it 1
almost 1
too 1
horrible 1
for 1
human 1
eyes 1
But 1
I 1
scarcely 1
observed 1
this 1
rage 1
and 1
hatred 1
had 1
at 1
first 1
deprived 1
me 1
of 1
utterance 1
and 1
I 1
recovered 1
only 1
to 1
overwhelm 1
him 1
with 1
words 1
expressive 1
of 1
furious 1
detestation 1
and 1
contempt 1
Devil 1
I 1
exclaimed 1
do 1
you 1
dare 1
approach 1
me 1
And 1
do 1
not 1
you 1
fear 1
the 1
fierce 1
vengeance 1
of 1
my 1
arm 1
wreaked 1
on 1
your 1
miserable 1
head 1
Begone 1
vile 1
insect 1
Or 1
rather 1
stay 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
trample 1
you 1
to 1
dust 1
And 1
oh 1
That 1
I 1
could 1
with 1
the 1
extinction 1
of 1
your 1
miserable 1
existence 1
restore 1
those 1
victims 1
whom 1
you 1
have 1
so 1
diabolically 1
murdered 1
I 1
expected 1
this 1
reception 1
said 1
the 1
daemon 1
All 1
men 1
hate 1
the 1
wretched 1
how 1
then 1
must 1
I 1
be 1
hated 1
who 1
am 1
miserable 1
beyond 1
all 1
living 1
things 1
Yet 1
you 1
my 1
creator 1
detest 1
and 1
spurn 1
me 1
thy 1
creature 1
to 1
whom 1
thou 1
art 1
bound 1
by 1
ties 1
only 1
dissoluble 1
by 1
the 1
annihilation 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
us 1
You 1
purpose 1
to 1
kill 1
me 1
How 1
dare 1
you 1
sport 1
thus 1
with 1
life 1
Do 1
your 1
duty 1
towards 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
do 1
mine 1
towards 1
you 1
and 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
mankind 1
If 1
you 1
will 1
comply 1
with 1
my 1
conditions 1
I 1
will 1
leave 1
them 1
and 1
you 1
at 1
peace 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
refuse 1
I 1
will 1
glut 1
the 1
maw 1
of 1
death 1
until 1
it 1
be 1
satiated 1
with 1
the 1
blood 1
of 1
your 1
remaining 1
friends 1
Abhorred 1
monster 1
Fiend 1
that 1
thou 1
art 1
The 1
tortures 1
of 1
hell 1
are 1
too 1
mild 1
a 1
vengeance 1
for 1
thy 1
crimes 1
Wretched 1
devil 1
You 1
reproach 1
me 1
with 1
your 1
creation 1
come 1
on 1
then 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
extinguish 1
the 1
spark 1
which 1
I 1
so 1
negligently 1
bestowed 1
My 1
rage 1
was 1
without 1
bounds 1
I 1
sprang 1
on 1
him 1
impelled 1
by 1
all 1
the 1
feelings 1
which 1
can 1
arm 1
one 1
being 1
against 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
another 1
He 1
easily 1
eluded 1
me 1
and 1
said 1
Be 1
calm 1
I 1
entreat 1
you 1
to 1
hear 1
me 1
before 1
you 1
give 1
vent 1
to 1
your 1
hatred 1
on 1
my 1
devoted 1
head 1
Have 1
I 1
not 1
suffered 1
enough 1
that 1
you 1
seek 1
to 1
increase 1
my 1
misery 1
Life 1
although 1
it 1
may 1
only 1
be 1
an 1
accumulation 1
of 1
anguish 1
is 1
dear 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
defend 1
it 1
Remember 1
thou 1
hast 1
made 1
me 1
more 1
powerful 1
than 1
thyself 1
my 1
height 1
is 1
superior 1
to 1
thine 1
my 1
joints 1
more 1
supple 1
But 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
tempted 1
to 1
set 1
myself 1
in 1
opposition 1
to 1
thee 1
I 1
am 1
thy 1
creature 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
be 1
even 1
mild 1
and 1
docile 1
to 1
my 1
natural 1
lord 1
and 1
king 1
if 1
thou 1
wilt 1
also 1
perform 1
thy 1
part 1
the 1
which 1
thou 1
owest 1
me 1
Oh 1
Frankenstein 1
be 1
not 1
equitable 1
to 1
every 1
other 1
and 1
trample 1
upon 1
me 1
alone 1
to 1
whom 1
thy 1
justice 1
and 1
even 1
thy 1
clemency 1
and 1
affection 1
is 1
most 1
due 1
Remember 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
thy 1
creature 1
I 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
thy 1
Adam 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
rather 1
the 1
fallen 1
angel 1
whom 1
thou 1
drivest 1
from 1
joy 1
for 1
no 1
misdeed 1
Everywhere 1
I 1
see 1
bliss 1
from 1
which 1
I 1
alone 1
am 1
irrevocably 1
excluded 1
I 1
was 1
benevolent 1
and 1
good 1
misery 1
made 1
me 1
a 1
fiend 1
Make 1
me 1
happy 1
and 1
I 1
shall 1
again 1
be 1
virtuous 1
Begone 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
hear 1
you 1
There 1
can 1
be 1
no 1
community 1
between 1
you 1
and 1
me 1
we 1
are 1
enemies 1
Begone 1
or 1
let 1
us 1
try 1
our 1
strength 1
in 1
a 1
fight 1
in 1
which 1
one 1
must 1
fall 1
How 1
can 1
I 1
move 1
thee 1
Will 1
no 1
entreaties 1
cause 1
thee 1
to 1
turn 1
a 1
favourable 1
eye 1
upon 1
thy 1
creature 1
who 1
implores 1
thy 1
goodness 1
and 1
compassion 1
Believe 1
me 1
Frankenstein 1
I 1
was 1
benevolent 1
my 1
soul 1
glowed 1
with 1
love 1
and 1
humanity 1
but 1
am 1
I 1
not 1
alone 1
miserably 1
alone 1
You 1
my 1
creator 1
abhor 1
me 1
what 1
hope 1
can 1
I 1
gather 1
from 1
your 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
who 1
owe 1
me 1
nothing 1
They 1
spurn 1
and 1
hate 1
me 1
The 1
desert 1
mountains 1
and 1
dreary 1
glaciers 1
are 1
my 1
refuge 1
I 1
have 1
wandered 1
here 1
many 1
days 1
the 1
caves 1
of 1
ice 1
which 1
I 1
only 1
do 1
not 1
fear 1
are 1
a 1
dwelling 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
which 1
man 1
does 1
not 1
grudge 1
These 1
bleak 1
skies 1
I 1
hail 1
for 1
they 1
are 1
kinder 1
to 1
me 1
than 1
your 1
fellow 1
beings 1
If 1
the 1
multitude 1
of 1
mankind 1
knew 1
of 1
my 1
existence 1
they 1
would 1
do 1
as 1
you 1
do 1
and 1
arm 1
themselves 1
for 1
my 1
destruction 1
Shall 1
I 1
not 1
then 1
hate 1
them 1
who 1
abhor 1
me 1
I 1
will 1
keep 1
no 1
terms 1
with 1
my 1
enemies 1
I 1
am 1
miserable 1
and 1
they 1
shall 1
share 1
my 1
wretchedness 1
Yet 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
your 1
power 1
to 1
recompense 1
me 1
and 1
deliver 1
them 1
from 1
an 1
evil 1
which 1
it 1
only 1
remains 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
make 1
so 1
great 1
that 1
not 1
only 1
you 1
and 1
your 1
family 1
but 1
thousands 1
of 1
others 1
shall 1
be 1
swallowed 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
whirlwinds 1
of 1
its 1
rage 1
Let 1
your 1
compassion 1
be 1
moved 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
disdain 1
me 1
Listen 1
to 1
my 1
tale 1
when 1
you 1
have 1
heard 1
that 1
abandon 1
or 1
commiserate 1
me 1
as 1
you 1
shall 1
judge 1
that 1
I 1
deserve 1
But 1
hear 1
me 1
The 1
guilty 1
are 1
allowed 1
by 1
human 1
laws 1
bloody 1
as 1
they 1
are 1
to 1
speak 1
in 1
their 1
own 1
defence 1
before 1
they 1
are 1
condemned 1
Listen 1
to 1
me 1
Frankenstein 1
You 1
accuse 1
me 1
of 1
murder 1
and 1
yet 1
you 1
would 1
with 1
a 1
satisfied 1
conscience 1
destroy 1
your 1
own 1
creature 1
Oh 1
praise 1
the 1
eternal 1
justice 1
of 1
man 1
Yet 1
I 1
ask 1
you 1
not 1
to 1
spare 1
me 1
listen 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
then 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
destroy 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
your 1
hands 1
Why 1
do 1
you 1
call 1
to 1
my 1
remembrance 1
I 1
rejoined 1
circumstances 1
of 1
which 1
I 1
shudder 1
to 1
reflect 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
miserable 1
origin 1
and 1
author 1
Cursed 1
be 1
the 1
day 1
abhorred 1
devil 1
in 1
which 1
you 1
first 1
saw 1
light 1
Cursed 1
although 1
I 1
curse 1
myself 1
be 1
the 1
hands 1
that 1
formed 1
you 1
You 1
have 1
made 1
me 1
wretched 1
beyond 1
expression 1
You 1
have 1
left 1
me 1
no 1
power 1
to 1
consider 1
whether 1
I 1
am 1
just 1
to 1
you 1
or 1
not 1
Begone 1
Relieve 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
your 1
detested 1
form 1
Thus 1
I 1
relieve 1
thee 1
my 1
creator 1
he 1
said 1
and 1
placed 1
his 1
hated 1
hands 1
before 1
my 1
eyes 1
which 1
I 1
flung 1
from 1
me 1
with 1
violence 1
thus 1
I 1
take 1
from 1
thee 1
a 1
sight 1
which 1
you 1
abhor 1
Still 1
thou 1
canst 1
listen 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
grant 1
me 1
thy 1
compassion 1
By 1
the 1
virtues 1
that 1
I 1
once 1
possessed 1
I 1
demand 1
this 1
from 1
you 1
Hear 1
my 1
tale 1
it 1
is 1
long 1
and 1
strange 1
and 1
the 1
temperature 1
of 1
this 1
place 1
is 1
not 1
fitting 1
to 1
your 1
fine 1
sensations 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
hut 1
upon 1
the 1
mountain 1
The 1
sun 1
is 1
yet 1
high 1
in 1
the 1
heavens 1
before 1
it 1
descends 1
to 1
hide 1
itself 1
behind 1
your 1
snowy 1
precipices 1
and 1
illuminate 1
another 1
world 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
heard 1
my 1
story 1
and 1
can 1
decide 1
On 1
you 1
it 1
rests 1
whether 1
I 1
quit 1
forever 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
man 1
and 1
lead 1
a 1
harmless 1
life 1
or 1
become 1
the 1
scourge 1
of 1
your 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
and 1
the 1
author 1
of 1
your 1
own 1
speedy 1
ruin 1
As 1
he 1
said 1
this 1
he 1
led 1
the 1
way 1
across 1
the 1
ice 1
I 1
followed 1
My 1
heart 1
was 1
full 1
and 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
answer 1
him 1
but 1
as 1
I 1
proceeded 1
I 1
weighed 1
the 1
various 1
arguments 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
used 1
and 1
determined 1
at 1
least 1
to 1
listen 1
to 1
his 1
tale 1
I 1
was 1
partly 1
urged 1
by 1
curiosity 1
and 1
compassion 1
confirmed 1
my 1
resolution 1
I 1
had 1
hitherto 1
supposed 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
murderer 1
of 1
my 1
brother 1
and 1
I 1
eagerly 1
sought 1
a 1
confirmation 1
or 1
denial 1
of 1
this 1
opinion 1
For 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
also 1
I 1
felt 1
what 1
the 1
duties 1
of 1
a 1
creator 1
towards 1
his 1
creature 1
were 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
ought 1
to 1
render 1
him 1
happy 1
before 1
I 1
complained 1
of 1
his 1
wickedness 1
These 1
motives 1
urged 1
me 1
to 1
comply 1
with 1
his 1
demand 1
We 1
crossed 1
the 1
ice 1
therefore 1
and 1
ascended 1
the 1
opposite 1
rock 1
The 1
air 1
was 1
cold 1
and 1
the 1
rain 1
again 1
began 1
to 1
descend 1
we 1
entered 1
the 1
hut 1
the 1
fiend 1
with 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
exultation 1
I 1
with 1
a 1
heavy 1
heart 1
and 1
depressed 1
spirits 1
But 1
I 1
consented 1
to 1
listen 1
and 1
seating 1
myself 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
which 1
my 1
odious 1
companion 1
had 1
lighted 1
he 1
thus 1
began 1
his 1
tale 1
Chapter 1
It 1
is 1
with 1
considerable 1
difficulty 1
that 1
I 1
remember 1
the 1
original 1
era 1
of 1
my 1
being 1
all 1
the 1
events 1
of 1
that 1
period 1
appear 1
confused 1
and 1
indistinct 1
A 1
strange 1
multiplicity 1
of 1
sensations 1
seized 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
saw 1
felt 1
heard 1
and 1
smelt 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
indeed 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
before 1
I 1
learned 1
to 1
distinguish 1
between 1
the 1
operations 1
of 1
my 1
various 1
senses 1
By 1
degrees 1
I 1
remember 1
a 1
stronger 1
light 1
pressed 1
upon 1
my 1
nerves 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
shut 1
my 1
eyes 1
Darkness 1
then 1
came 1
over 1
me 1
and 1
troubled 1
me 1
but 1
hardly 1
had 1
I 1
felt 1
this 1
when 1
by 1
opening 1
my 1
eyes 1
as 1
I 1
now 1
suppose 1
the 1
light 1
poured 1
in 1
upon 1
me 1
again 1
I 1
walked 1
and 1
I 1
believe 1
descended 1
but 1
I 1
presently 1
found 1
a 1
great 1
alteration 1
in 1
my 1
sensations 1
Before 1
dark 1
and 1
opaque 1
bodies 1
had 1
surrounded 1
me 1
impervious 1
to 1
my 1
touch 1
or 1
sight 1
but 1
I 1
now 1
found 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
wander 1
on 1
at 1
liberty 1
with 1
no 1
obstacles 1
which 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
either 1
surmount 1
or 1
avoid 1
The 1
light 1
became 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
oppressive 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
heat 1
wearying 1
me 1
as 1
I 1
walked 1
I 1
sought 1
a 1
place 1
where 1
I 1
could 1
receive 1
shade 1
This 1
was 1
the 1
forest 1
near 1
Ingolstadt 1
and 1
here 1
I 1
lay 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
a 1
brook 1
resting 1
from 1
my 1
fatigue 1
until 1
I 1
felt 1
tormented 1
by 1
hunger 1
and 1
thirst 1
This 1
roused 1
me 1
from 1
my 1
nearly 1
dormant 1
state 1
and 1
I 1
ate 1
some 1
berries 1
which 1
I 1
found 1
hanging 1
on 1
the 1
trees 1
or 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
I 1
slaked 1
my 1
thirst 1
at 1
the 1
brook 1
and 1
then 1
lying 1
down 1
was 1
overcome 1
by 1
sleep 1
It 1
was 1
dark 1
when 1
I 1
awoke 1
I 1
felt 1
cold 1
also 1
and 1
half 1
frightened 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
instinctively 1
finding 1
myself 1
so 1
desolate 1
Before 1
I 1
had 1
quitted 1
your 1
apartment 1
on 1
a 1
sensation 1
of 1
cold 1
I 1
had 1
covered 1
myself 1
with 1
some 1
clothes 1
but 1
these 1
were 1
insufficient 1
to 1
secure 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
dews 1
of 1
night 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
poor 1
helpless 1
miserable 1
wretch 1
I 1
knew 1
and 1
could 1
distinguish 1
nothing 1
but 1
feeling 1
pain 1
invade 1
me 1
on 1
all 1
sides 1
I 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
wept 1
Soon 1
a 1
gentle 1
light 1
stole 1
over 1
the 1
heavens 1
and 1
gave 1
me 1
a 1
sensation 1
of 1
pleasure 1
I 1
started 1
up 1
and 1
beheld 1
a 1
radiant 1
form 1
rise 1
from 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
The 1
moon 1
I 1
gazed 1
with 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
wonder 1
It 1
moved 1
slowly 1
but 1
it 1
enlightened 1
my 1
path 1
and 1
I 1
again 1
went 1
out 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
berries 1
I 1
was 1
still 1
cold 1
when 1
under 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
I 1
found 1
a 1
huge 1
cloak 1
with 1
which 1
I 1
covered 1
myself 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
No 1
distinct 1
ideas 1
occupied 1
my 1
mind 1
all 1
was 1
confused 1
I 1
felt 1
light 1
and 1
hunger 1
and 1
thirst 1
and 1
darkness 1
innumerable 1
sounds 1
rang 1
in 1
my 1
ears 1
and 1
on 1
all 1
sides 1
various 1
scents 1
saluted 1
me 1
the 1
only 1
object 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
distinguish 1
was 1
the 1
bright 1
moon 1
and 1
I 1
fixed 1
my 1
eyes 1
on 1
that 1
with 1
pleasure 1
Several 1
changes 1
of 1
day 1
and 1
night 1
passed 1
and 1
the 1
orb 1
of 1
night 1
had 1
greatly 1
lessened 1
when 1
I 1
began 1
to 1
distinguish 1
my 1
sensations 1
from 1
each 1
other 1
I 1
gradually 1
saw 1
plainly 1
the 1
clear 1
stream 1
that 1
supplied 1
me 1
with 1
drink 1
and 1
the 1
trees 1
that 1
shaded 1
me 1
with 1
their 1
foliage 1
I 1
was 1
delighted 1
when 1
I 1
first 1
discovered 1
that 1
a 1
pleasant 1
sound 1
which 1
often 1
saluted 1
my 1
ears 1
proceeded 1
from 1
the 1
throats 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
winged 1
animals 1
who 1
had 1
often 1
intercepted 1
the 1
light 1
from 1
my 1
eyes 1
I 1
began 1
also 1
to 1
observe 1
with 1
greater 1
accuracy 1
the 1
forms 1
that 1
surrounded 1
me 1
and 1
to 1
perceive 1
the 1
boundaries 1
of 1
the 1
radiant 1
roof 1
of 1
light 1
which 1
canopied 1
me 1
Sometimes 1
I 1
tried 1
to 1
imitate 1
the 1
pleasant 1
songs 1
of 1
the 1
birds 1
but 1
was 1
unable 1
Sometimes 1
I 1
wished 1
to 1
express 1
my 1
sensations 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
mode 1
but 1
the 1
uncouth 1
and 1
inarticulate 1
sounds 1
which 1
broke 1
from 1
me 1
frightened 1
me 1
into 1
silence 1
again 1
The 1
moon 1
had 1
disappeared 1
from 1
the 1
night 1
and 1
again 1
with 1
a 1
lessened 1
form 1
showed 1
itself 1
while 1
I 1
still 1
remained 1
in 1
the 1
forest 1
My 1
sensations 1
had 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
become 1
distinct 1
and 1
my 1
mind 1
received 1
every 1
day 1
additional 1
ideas 1
My 1
eyes 1
became 1
accustomed 1
to 1
the 1
light 1
and 1
to 1
perceive 1
objects 1
in 1
their 1
right 1
forms 1
I 1
distinguished 1
the 1
insect 1
from 1
the 1
herb 1
and 1
by 1
degrees 1
one 1
herb 1
from 1
another 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
sparrow 1
uttered 1
none 1
but 1
harsh 1
notes 1
whilst 1
those 1
of 1
the 1
blackbird 1
and 1
thrush 1
were 1
sweet 1
and 1
enticing 1
One 1
day 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
oppressed 1
by 1
cold 1
I 1
found 1
a 1
fire 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
left 1
by 1
some 1
wandering 1
beggars 1
and 1
was 1
overcome 1
with 1
delight 1
at 1
the 1
warmth 1
I 1
experienced 1
from 1
it 1
In 1
my 1
joy 1
I 1
thrust 1
my 1
hand 1
into 1
the 1
live 1
embers 1
but 1
quickly 1
drew 1
it 1
out 1
again 1
with 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
pain 1
How 1
strange 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
the 1
same 1
cause 1
should 1
produce 1
such 1
opposite 1
effects 1
I 1
examined 1
the 1
materials 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
to 1
my 1
joy 1
found 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
composed 1
of 1
wood 1
I 1
quickly 1
collected 1
some 1
branches 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
wet 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
burn 1
I 1
was 1
pained 1
at 1
this 1
and 1
sat 1
still 1
watching 1
the 1
operation 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
The 1
wet 1
wood 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
placed 1
near 1
the 1
heat 1
dried 1
and 1
itself 1
became 1
inflamed 1
I 1
reflected 1
on 1
this 1
and 1
by 1
touching 1
the 1
various 1
branches 1
I 1
discovered 1
the 1
cause 1
and 1
busied 1
myself 1
in 1
collecting 1
a 1
great 1
quantity 1
of 1
wood 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
dry 1
it 1
and 1
have 1
a 1
plentiful 1
supply 1
of 1
fire 1
When 1
night 1
came 1
on 1
and 1
brought 1
sleep 1
with 1
it 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
greatest 1
fear 1
lest 1
my 1
fire 1
should 1
be 1
extinguished 1
I 1
covered 1
it 1
carefully 1
with 1
dry 1
wood 1
and 1
leaves 1
and 1
placed 1
wet 1
branches 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
spreading 1
my 1
cloak 1
I 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
sank 1
into 1
sleep 1
It 1
was 1
morning 1
when 1
I 1
awoke 1
and 1
my 1
first 1
care 1
was 1
to 1
visit 1
the 1
fire 1
I 1
uncovered 1
it 1
and 1
a 1
gentle 1
breeze 1
quickly 1
fanned 1
it 1
into 1
a 1
flame 1
I 1
observed 1
this 1
also 1
and 1
contrived 1
a 1
fan 1
of 1
branches 1
which 1
roused 1
the 1
embers 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
nearly 1
extinguished 1
When 1
night 1
came 1
again 1
I 1
found 1
with 1
pleasure 1
that 1
the 1
fire 1
gave 1
light 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
heat 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
discovery 1
of 1
this 1
element 1
was 1
useful 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
food 1
for 1
I 1
found 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
offals 1
that 1
the 1
travellers 1
had 1
left 1
had 1
been 1
roasted 1
and 1
tasted 1
much 1
more 1
savoury 1
than 1
the 1
berries 1
I 1
gathered 1
from 1
the 1
trees 1
I 1
tried 1
therefore 1
to 1
dress 1
my 1
food 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
manner 1
placing 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
live 1
embers 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
berries 1
were 1
spoiled 1
by 1
this 1
operation 1
and 1
the 1
nuts 1
and 1
roots 1
much 1
improved 1
Food 1
however 1
became 1
scarce 1
and 1
I 1
often 1
spent 1
the 1
whole 1
day 1
searching 1
in 1
vain 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
acorns 1
to 1
assuage 1
the 1
pangs 1
of 1
hunger 1
When 1
I 1
found 1
this 1
I 1
resolved 1
to 1
quit 1
the 1
place 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
hitherto 1
inhabited 1
to 1
seek 1
for 1
one 1
where 1
the 1
few 1
wants 1
I 1
experienced 1
would 1
be 1
more 1
easily 1
satisfied 1
In 1
this 1
emigration 1
I 1
exceedingly 1
lamented 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
obtained 1
through 1
accident 1
and 1
knew 1
not 1
how 1
to 1
reproduce 1
it 1
I 1
gave 1
several 1
hours 1
to 1
the 1
serious 1
consideration 1
of 1
this 1
difficulty 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
relinquish 1
all 1
attempt 1
to 1
supply 1
it 1
and 1
wrapping 1
myself 1
up 1
in 1
my 1
cloak 1
I 1
struck 1
across 1
the 1
wood 1
towards 1
the 1
setting 1
sun 1
I 1
passed 1
three 1
days 1
in 1
these 1
rambles 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
discovered 1
the 1
open 1
country 1
A 1
great 1
fall 1
of 1
snow 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
and 1
the 1
fields 1
were 1
of 1
one 1
uniform 1
white 1
the 1
appearance 1
was 1
disconsolate 1
and 1
I 1
found 1
my 1
feet 1
chilled 1
by 1
the 1
cold 1
damp 1
substance 1
that 1
covered 1
the 1
ground 1
It 1
was 1
about 1
seven 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
I 1
longed 1
to 1
obtain 1
food 1
and 1
shelter 1
at 1
length 1
I 1
perceived 1
a 1
small 1
hut 1
on 1
a 1
rising 1
ground 1
which 1
had 1
doubtless 1
been 1
built 1
for 1
the 1
convenience 1
of 1
some 1
shepherd 1
This 1
was 1
a 1
new 1
sight 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
examined 1
the 1
structure 1
with 1
great 1
curiosity 1
Finding 1
the 1
door 1
open 1
I 1
entered 1
An 1
old 1
man 1
sat 1
in 1
it 1
near 1
a 1
fire 1
over 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
preparing 1
his 1
breakfast 1
He 1
turned 1
on 1
hearing 1
a 1
noise 1
and 1
perceiving 1
me 1
shrieked 1
loudly 1
and 1
quitting 1
the 1
hut 1
ran 1
across 1
the 1
fields 1
with 1
a 1
speed 1
of 1
which 1
his 1
debilitated 1
form 1
hardly 1
appeared 1
capable 1
His 1
appearance 1
different 1
from 1
any 1
I 1
had 1
ever 1
before 1
seen 1
and 1
his 1
flight 1
somewhat 1
surprised 1
me 1
But 1
I 1
was 1
enchanted 1
by 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
the 1
hut 1
here 1
the 1
snow 1
and 1
rain 1
could 1
not 1
penetrate 1
the 1
ground 1
was 1
dry 1
and 1
it 1
presented 1
to 1
me 1
then 1
as 1
exquisite 1
and 1
divine 1
a 1
retreat 1
as 1
Pandemonium 1
appeared 1
to 1
the 1
demons 1
of 1
hell 1
after 1
their 1
sufferings 1
in 1
the 1
lake 1
of 1
fire 1
I 1
greedily 1
devoured 1
the 1
remnants 1
of 1
the 1
shepherd 1
s 1
breakfast 1
which 1
consisted 1
of 1
bread 1
cheese 1
milk 1
and 1
wine 1
the 1
latter 1
however 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
Then 1
overcome 1
by 1
fatigue 1
I 1
lay 1
down 1
among 1
some 1
straw 1
and 1
fell 1
asleep 1
It 1
was 1
noon 1
when 1
I 1
awoke 1
and 1
allured 1
by 1
the 1
warmth 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
which 1
shone 1
brightly 1
on 1
the 1
white 1
ground 1
I 1
determined 1
to 1
recommence 1
my 1
travels 1
and 1
depositing 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
the 1
peasant 1
s 1
breakfast 1
in 1
a 1
wallet 1
I 1
found 1
I 1
proceeded 1
across 1
the 1
fields 1
for 1
several 1
hours 1
until 1
at 1
sunset 1
I 1
arrived 1
at 1
a 1
village 1
How 1
miraculous 1
did 1
this 1
appear 1
The 1
huts 1
the 1
neater 1
cottages 1
and 1
stately 1
houses 1
engaged 1
my 1
admiration 1
by 1
turns 1
The 1
vegetables 1
in 1
the 1
gardens 1
the 1
milk 1
and 1
cheese 1
that 1
I 1
saw 1
placed 1
at 1
the 1
windows 1
of 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
cottages 1
allured 1
my 1
appetite 1
One 1
of 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
these 1
I 1
entered 1
but 1
I 1
had 1
hardly 1
placed 1
my 1
foot 1
within 1
the 1
door 1
before 1
the 1
children 1
shrieked 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
women 1
fainted 1
The 1
whole 1
village 1
was 1
roused 1
some 1
fled 1
some 1
attacked 1
me 1
until 1
grievously 1
bruised 1
by 1
stones 1
and 1
many 1
other 1
kinds 1
of 1
missile 1
weapons 1
I 1
escaped 1
to 1
the 1
open 1
country 1
and 1
fearfully 1
took 1
refuge 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
hovel 1
quite 1
bare 1
and 1
making 1
a 1
wretched 1
appearance 1
after 1
the 1
palaces 1
I 1
had 1
beheld 1
in 1
the 1
village 1
This 1
hovel 1
however 1
joined 1
a 1
cottage 1
of 1
a 1
neat 1
and 1
pleasant 1
appearance 1
but 1
after 1
my 1
late 1
dearly 1
bought 1
experience 1
I 1
dared 1
not 1
enter 1
it 1
My 1
place 1
of 1
refuge 1
was 1
constructed 1
of 1
wood 1
but 1
so 1
low 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
with 1
difficulty 1
sit 1
upright 1
in 1
it 1
No 1
wood 1
however 1
was 1
placed 1
on 1
the 1
earth 1
which 1
formed 1
the 1
floor 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
dry 1
and 1
although 1
the 1
wind 1
entered 1
it 1
by 1
innumerable 1
chinks 1
I 1
found 1
it 1
an 1
agreeable 1
asylum 1
from 1
the 1
snow 1
and 1
rain 1
Here 1
then 1
I 1
retreated 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
happy 1
to 1
have 1
found 1
a 1
shelter 1
however 1
miserable 1
from 1
the 1
inclemency 1
of 1
the 1
season 1
and 1
still 1
more 1
from 1
the 1
barbarity 1
of 1
man 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
morning 1
dawned 1
I 1
crept 1
from 1
my 1
kennel 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
view 1
the 1
adjacent 1
cottage 1
and 1
discover 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
remain 1
in 1
the 1
habitation 1
I 1
had 1
found 1
It 1
was 1
situated 1
against 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
surrounded 1
on 1
the 1
sides 1
which 1
were 1
exposed 1
by 1
a 1
pig 1
sty 1
and 1
a 1
clear 1
pool 1
of 1
water 1
One 1
part 1
was 1
open 1
and 1
by 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
crept 1
in 1
but 1
now 1
I 1
covered 1
every 1
crevice 1
by 1
which 1
I 1
might 1
be 1
perceived 1
with 1
stones 1
and 1
wood 1
yet 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
manner 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
move 1
them 1
on 1
occasion 1
to 1
pass 1
out 1
all 1
the 1
light 1
I 1
enjoyed 1
came 1
through 1
the 1
sty 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
sufficient 1
for 1
me 1
Having 1
thus 1
arranged 1
my 1
dwelling 1
and 1
carpeted 1
it 1
with 1
clean 1
straw 1
I 1
retired 1
for 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
figure 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
and 1
I 1
remembered 1
too 1
well 1
my 1
treatment 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
to 1
trust 1
myself 1
in 1
his 1
power 1
I 1
had 1
first 1
however 1
provided 1
for 1
my 1
sustenance 1
for 1
that 1
day 1
by 1
a 1
loaf 1
of 1
coarse 1
bread 1
which 1
I 1
purloined 1
and 1
a 1
cup 1
with 1
which 1
I 1
could 1
drink 1
more 1
conveniently 1
than 1
from 1
my 1
hand 1
of 1
the 1
pure 1
water 1
which 1
flowed 1
by 1
my 1
retreat 1
The 1
floor 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
raised 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
kept 1
perfectly 1
dry 1
and 1
by 1
its 1
vicinity 1
to 1
the 1
chimney 1
of 1
the 1
cottage 1
it 1
was 1
tolerably 1
warm 1
Being 1
thus 1
provided 1
I 1
resolved 1
to 1
reside 1
in 1
this 1
hovel 1
until 1
something 1
should 1
occur 1
which 1
might 1
alter 1
my 1
determination 1
It 1
was 1
indeed 1
a 1
paradise 1
compared 1
to 1
the 1
bleak 1
forest 1
my 1
former 1
residence 1
the 1
rain 1
dropping 1
branches 1
and 1
dank 1
earth 1
I 1
ate 1
my 1
breakfast 1
with 1
pleasure 1
and 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
remove 1
a 1
plank 1
to 1
procure 1
myself 1
a 1
little 1
water 1
when 1
I 1
heard 1
a 1
step 1
and 1
looking 1
through 1
a 1
small 1
chink 1
I 1
beheld 1
a 1
young 1
creature 1
with 1
a 1
pail 1
on 1
her 1
head 1
passing 1
before 1
my 1
hovel 1
The 1
girl 1
was 1
young 1
and 1
of 1
gentle 1
demeanour 1
unlike 1
what 1
I 1
have 1
since 1
found 1
cottagers 1
and 1
farmhouse 1
servants 1
to 1
be 1
Yet 1
she 1
was 1
meanly 1
dressed 1
a 1
coarse 1
blue 1
petticoat 1
and 1
a 1
linen 1
jacket 1
being 1
her 1
only 1
garb 1
her 1
fair 1
hair 1
was 1
plaited 1
but 1
not 1
adorned 1
she 1
looked 1
patient 1
yet 1
sad 1
I 1
lost 1
sight 1
of 1
her 1
and 1
in 1
about 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
she 1
returned 1
bearing 1
the 1
pail 1
which 1
was 1
now 1
partly 1
filled 1
with 1
milk 1
As 1
she 1
walked 1
along 1
seemingly 1
incommoded 1
by 1
the 1
burden 1
a 1
young 1
man 1
met 1
her 1
whose 1
countenance 1
expressed 1
a 1
deeper 1
despondence 1
Uttering 1
a 1
few 1
sounds 1
with 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
melancholy 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
pail 1
from 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
bore 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
cottage 1
himself 1
She 1
followed 1
and 1
they 1
disappeared 1
Presently 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
again 1
with 1
some 1
tools 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
cross 1
the 1
field 1
behind 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
was 1
also 1
busied 1
sometimes 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
sometimes 1
in 1
the 1
yard 1
On 1
examining 1
my 1
dwelling 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
windows 1
of 1
the 1
cottage 1
had 1
formerly 1
occupied 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
panes 1
had 1
been 1
filled 1
up 1
with 1
wood 1
In 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
and 1
almost 1
imperceptible 1
chink 1
through 1
which 1
the 1
eye 1
could 1
just 1
penetrate 1
Through 1
this 1
crevice 1
a 1
small 1
room 1
was 1
visible 1
whitewashed 1
and 1
clean 1
but 1
very 1
bare 1
of 1
furniture 1
In 1
one 1
corner 1
near 1
a 1
small 1
fire 1
sat 1
an 1
old 1
man 1
leaning 1
his 1
head 1
on 1
his 1
hands 1
in 1
a 1
disconsolate 1
attitude 1
The 1
young 1
girl 1
was 1
occupied 1
in 1
arranging 1
the 1
cottage 1
but 1
presently 1
she 1
took 1
something 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
drawer 1
which 1
employed 1
her 1
hands 1
and 1
she 1
sat 1
down 1
beside 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
who 1
taking 1
up 1
an 1
instrument 1
began 1
to 1
play 1
and 1
to 1
produce 1
sounds 1
sweeter 1
than 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
the 1
thrush 1
or 1
the 1
nightingale 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
lovely 1
sight 1
even 1
to 1
me 1
poor 1
wretch 1
who 1
had 1
never 1
beheld 1
aught 1
beautiful 1
before 1
The 1
silver 1
hair 1
and 1
benevolent 1
countenance 1
of 1
the 1
aged 1
cottager 1
won 1
my 1
reverence 1
while 1
the 1
gentle 1
manners 1
of 1
the 1
girl 1
enticed 1
my 1
love 1
He 1
played 1
a 1
sweet 1
mournful 1
air 1
which 1
I 1
perceived 1
drew 1
tears 1
from 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
his 1
amiable 1
companion 1
of 1
which 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
took 1
no 1
notice 1
until 1
she 1
sobbed 1
audibly 1
he 1
then 1
pronounced 1
a 1
few 1
sounds 1
and 1
the 1
fair 1
creature 1
leaving 1
her 1
work 1
knelt 1
at 1
his 1
feet 1
He 1
raised 1
her 1
and 1
smiled 1
with 1
such 1
kindness 1
and 1
affection 1
that 1
I 1
felt 1
sensations 1
of 1
a 1
peculiar 1
and 1
overpowering 1
nature 1
they 1
were 1
a 1
mixture 1
of 1
pain 1
and 1
pleasure 1
such 1
as 1
I 1
had 1
never 1
before 1
experienced 1
either 1
from 1
hunger 1
or 1
cold 1
warmth 1
or 1
food 1
and 1
I 1
withdrew 1
from 1
the 1
window 1
unable 1
to 1
bear 1
these 1
emotions 1
Soon 1
after 1
this 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
returned 1
bearing 1
on 1
his 1
shoulders 1
a 1
load 1
of 1
wood 1
The 1
girl 1
met 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
helped 1
to 1
relieve 1
him 1
of 1
his 1
burden 1
and 1
taking 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
fuel 1
into 1
the 1
cottage 1
placed 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
fire 1
then 1
she 1
and 1
the 1
youth 1
went 1
apart 1
into 1
a 1
nook 1
of 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
he 1
showed 1
her 1
a 1
large 1
loaf 1
and 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
cheese 1
She 1
seemed 1
pleased 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
for 1
some 1
roots 1
and 1
plants 1
which 1
she 1
placed 1
in 1
water 1
and 1
then 1
upon 1
the 1
fire 1
She 1
afterwards 1
continued 1
her 1
work 1
whilst 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
appeared 1
busily 1
employed 1
in 1
digging 1
and 1
pulling 1
up 1
roots 1
After 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
employed 1
thus 1
about 1
an 1
hour 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
joined 1
him 1
and 1
they 1
entered 1
the 1
cottage 1
together 1
The 1
old 1
man 1
had 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
been 1
pensive 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
his 1
companions 1
he 1
assumed 1
a 1
more 1
cheerful 1
air 1
and 1
they 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
eat 1
The 1
meal 1
was 1
quickly 1
dispatched 1
The 1
young 1
woman 1
was 1
again 1
occupied 1
in 1
arranging 1
the 1
cottage 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
walked 1
before 1
the 1
cottage 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
leaning 1
on 1
the 1
arm 1
of 1
the 1
youth 1
Nothing 1
could 1
exceed 1
in 1
beauty 1
the 1
contrast 1
between 1
these 1
two 1
excellent 1
creatures 1
One 1
was 1
old 1
with 1
silver 1
hairs 1
and 1
a 1
countenance 1
beaming 1
with 1
benevolence 1
and 1
love 1
the 1
younger 1
was 1
slight 1
and 1
graceful 1
in 1
his 1
figure 1
and 1
his 1
features 1
were 1
moulded 1
with 1
the 1
finest 1
symmetry 1
yet 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
attitude 1
expressed 1
the 1
utmost 1
sadness 1
and 1
despondency 1
The 1
old 1
man 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
the 1
youth 1
with 1
tools 1
different 1
from 1
those 1
he 1
had 1
used 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
directed 1
his 1
steps 1
across 1
the 1
fields 1
Night 1
quickly 1
shut 1
in 1
but 1
to 1
my 1
extreme 1
wonder 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
cottagers 1
had 1
a 1
means 1
of 1
prolonging 1
light 1
by 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
tapers 1
and 1
was 1
delighted 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
the 1
setting 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
did 1
not 1
put 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
the 1
pleasure 1
I 1
experienced 1
in 1
watching 1
my 1
human 1
neighbours 1
In 1
the 1
evening 1
the 1
young 1
girl 1
and 1
her 1
companion 1
were 1
employed 1
in 1
various 1
occupations 1
which 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
understand 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
again 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
instrument 1
which 1
produced 1
the 1
divine 1
sounds 1
that 1
had 1
enchanted 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
So 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
finished 1
the 1
youth 1
began 1
not 1
to 1
play 1
but 1
to 1
utter 1
sounds 1
that 1
were 1
monotonous 1
and 1
neither 1
resembling 1
the 1
harmony 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
s 1
instrument 1
nor 1
the 1
songs 1
of 1
the 1
birds 1
I 1
since 1
found 1
that 1
he 1
read 1
aloud 1
but 1
at 1
that 1
time 1
I 1
knew 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
science 1
of 1
words 1
or 1
letters 1
The 1
family 1
after 1
having 1
been 1
thus 1
occupied 1
for 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
extinguished 1
their 1
lights 1
and 1
retired 1
as 1
I 1
conjectured 1
to 1
rest 1
Chapter 1
I 1
lay 1
on 1
my 1
straw 1
but 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
sleep 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
occurrences 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
What 1
chiefly 1
struck 1
me 1
was 1
the 1
gentle 1
manners 1
of 1
these 1
people 1
and 1
I 1
longed 1
to 1
join 1
them 1
but 1
dared 1
not 1
I 1
remembered 1
too 1
well 1
the 1
treatment 1
I 1
had 1
suffered 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
from 1
the 1
barbarous 1
villagers 1
and 1
resolved 1
whatever 1
course 1
of 1
conduct 1
I 1
might 1
hereafter 1
think 1
it 1
right 1
to 1
pursue 1
that 1
for 1
the 1
present 1
I 1
would 1
remain 1
quietly 1
in 1
my 1
hovel 1
watching 1
and 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
discover 1
the 1
motives 1
which 1
influenced 1
their 1
actions 1
The 1
cottagers 1
arose 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
before 1
the 1
sun 1
The 1
young 1
woman 1
arranged 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
prepared 1
the 1
food 1
and 1
the 1
youth 1
departed 1
after 1
the 1
first 1
meal 1
This 1
day 1
was 1
passed 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
routine 1
as 1
that 1
which 1
preceded 1
it 1
The 1
young 1
man 1
was 1
constantly 1
employed 1
out 1
of 1
doors 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
in 1
various 1
laborious 1
occupations 1
within 1
The 1
old 1
man 1
whom 1
I 1
soon 1
perceived 1
to 1
be 1
blind 1
employed 1
his 1
leisure 1
hours 1
on 1
his 1
instrument 1
or 1
in 1
contemplation 1
Nothing 1
could 1
exceed 1
the 1
love 1
and 1
respect 1
which 1
the 1
younger 1
cottagers 1
exhibited 1
towards 1
their 1
venerable 1
companion 1
They 1
performed 1
towards 1
him 1
every 1
little 1
office 1
of 1
affection 1
and 1
duty 1
with 1
gentleness 1
and 1
he 1
rewarded 1
them 1
by 1
his 1
benevolent 1
smiles 1
They 1
were 1
not 1
entirely 1
happy 1
The 1
young 1
man 1
and 1
his 1
companion 1
often 1
went 1
apart 1
and 1
appeared 1
to 1
weep 1
I 1
saw 1
no 1
cause 1
for 1
their 1
unhappiness 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
deeply 1
affected 1
by 1
it 1
If 1
such 1
lovely 1
creatures 1
were 1
miserable 1
it 1
was 1
less 1
strange 1
that 1
I 1
an 1
imperfect 1
and 1
solitary 1
being 1
should 1
be 1
wretched 1
Yet 1
why 1
were 1
these 1
gentle 1
beings 1
unhappy 1
They 1
possessed 1
a 1
delightful 1
house 1
for 1
such 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
every 1
luxury 1
they 1
had 1
a 1
fire 1
to 1
warm 1
them 1
when 1
chill 1
and 1
delicious 1
viands 1
when 1
hungry 1
they 1
were 1
dressed 1
in 1
excellent 1
clothes 1
and 1
still 1
more 1
they 1
enjoyed 1
one 1
another 1
s 1
company 1
and 1
speech 1
interchanging 1
each 1
day 1
looks 1
of 1
affection 1
and 1
kindness 1
What 1
did 1
their 1
tears 1
imply 1
Did 1
they 1
really 1
express 1
pain 1
I 1
was 1
at 1
first 1
unable 1
to 1
solve 1
these 1
questions 1
but 1
perpetual 1
attention 1
and 1
time 1
explained 1
to 1
me 1
many 1
appearances 1
which 1
were 1
at 1
first 1
enigmatic 1
A 1
considerable 1
period 1
elapsed 1
before 1
I 1
discovered 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
causes 1
of 1
the 1
uneasiness 1
of 1
this 1
amiable 1
family 1
it 1
was 1
poverty 1
and 1
they 1
suffered 1
that 1
evil 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
distressing 1
degree 1
Their 1
nourishment 1
consisted 1
entirely 1
of 1
the 1
vegetables 1
of 1
their 1
garden 1
and 1
the 1
milk 1
of 1
one 1
cow 1
which 1
gave 1
very 1
little 1
during 1
the 1
winter 1
when 1
its 1
masters 1
could 1
scarcely 1
procure 1
food 1
to 1
support 1
it 1
They 1
often 1
I 1
believe 1
suffered 1
the 1
pangs 1
of 1
hunger 1
very 1
poignantly 1
especially 1
the 1
two 1
younger 1
cottagers 1
for 1
several 1
times 1
they 1
placed 1
food 1
before 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
when 1
they 1
reserved 1
none 1
for 1
themselves 1
This 1
trait 1
of 1
kindness 1
moved 1
me 1
sensibly 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
accustomed 1
during 1
the 1
night 1
to 1
steal 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
their 1
store 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
consumption 1
but 1
when 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
in 1
doing 1
this 1
I 1
inflicted 1
pain 1
on 1
the 1
cottagers 1
I 1
abstained 1
and 1
satisfied 1
myself 1
with 1
berries 1
nuts 1
and 1
roots 1
which 1
I 1
gathered 1
from 1
a 1
neighbouring 1
wood 1
I 1
discovered 1
also 1
another 1
means 1
through 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
enabled 1
to 1
assist 1
their 1
labours 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
youth 1
spent 1
a 1
great 1
part 1
of 1
each 1
day 1
in 1
collecting 1
wood 1
for 1
the 1
family 1
fire 1
and 1
during 1
the 1
night 1
I 1
often 1
took 1
his 1
tools 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
which 1
I 1
quickly 1
discovered 1
and 1
brought 1
home 1
firing 1
sufficient 1
for 1
the 1
consumption 1
of 1
several 1
days 1
I 1
remember 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
that 1
I 1
did 1
this 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
when 1
she 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
appeared 1
greatly 1
astonished 1
on 1
seeing 1
a 1
great 1
pile 1
of 1
wood 1
on 1
the 1
outside 1
She 1
uttered 1
some 1
words 1
in 1
a 1
loud 1
voice 1
and 1
the 1
youth 1
joined 1
her 1
who 1
also 1
expressed 1
surprise 1
I 1
observed 1
with 1
pleasure 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
forest 1
that 1
day 1
but 1
spent 1
it 1
in 1
repairing 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
cultivating 1
the 1
garden 1
By 1
degrees 1
I 1
made 1
a 1
discovery 1
of 1
still 1
greater 1
moment 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
these 1
people 1
possessed 1
a 1
method 1
of 1
communicating 1
their 1
experience 1
and 1
feelings 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
by 1
articulate 1
sounds 1
I 1
perceived 1
that 1
the 1
words 1
they 1
spoke 1
sometimes 1
produced 1
pleasure 1
or 1
pain 1
smiles 1
or 1
sadness 1
in 1
the 1
minds 1
and 1
countenances 1
of 1
the 1
hearers 1
This 1
was 1
indeed 1
a 1
godlike 1
science 1
and 1
I 1
ardently 1
desired 1
to 1
become 1
acquainted 1
with 1
it 1
But 1
I 1
was 1
baffled 1
in 1
every 1
attempt 1
I 1
made 1
for 1
this 1
purpose 1
Their 1
pronunciation 1
was 1
quick 1
and 1
the 1
words 1
they 1
uttered 1
not 1
having 1
any 1
apparent 1
connection 1
with 1
visible 1
objects 1
I 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
discover 1
any 1
clue 1
by 1
which 1
I 1
could 1
unravel 1
the 1
mystery 1
of 1
their 1
reference 1
By 1
great 1
application 1
however 1
and 1
after 1
having 1
remained 1
during 1
the 1
space 1
of 1
several 1
revolutions 1
of 1
the 1
moon 1
in 1
my 1
hovel 1
I 1
discovered 1
the 1
names 1
that 1
were 1
given 1
to 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
familiar 1
objects 1
of 1
discourse 1
I 1
learned 1
and 1
applied 1
the 1
words 1
fire 1
milk 1
bread 1
and 1
wood 1
I 1
learned 1
also 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
the 1
cottagers 1
themselves 1
The 1
youth 1
and 1
his 1
companion 1
had 1
each 1
of 1
them 1
several 1
names 1
but 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
had 1
only 1
one 1
which 1
was 1
father 1
The 1
girl 1
was 1
called 1
sister 1
or 1
Agatha 1
and 1
the 1
youth 1
Felix 1
brother 1
or 1
son 1
I 1
cannot 1
describe 1
the 1
delight 1
I 1
felt 1
when 1
I 1
learned 1
the 1
ideas 1
appropriated 1
to 1
each 1
of 1
these 1
sounds 1
and 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
pronounce 1
them 1
I 1
distinguished 1
several 1
other 1
words 1
without 1
being 1
able 1
as 1
yet 1
to 1
understand 1
or 1
apply 1
them 1
such 1
as 1
good 1
dearest 1
unhappy 1
I 1
spent 1
the 1
winter 1
in 1
this 1
manner 1
The 1
gentle 1
manners 1
and 1
beauty 1
of 1
the 1
cottagers 1
greatly 1
endeared 1
them 1
to 1
me 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
unhappy 1
I 1
felt 1
depressed 1
when 1
they 1
rejoiced 1
I 1
sympathized 1
in 1
their 1
joys 1
I 1
saw 1
few 1
human 1
beings 1
besides 1
them 1
and 1
if 1
any 1
other 1
happened 1
to 1
enter 1
the 1
cottage 1
their 1
harsh 1
manners 1
and 1
rude 1
gait 1
only 1
enhanced 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
superior 1
accomplishments 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
The 1
old 1
man 1
I 1
could 1
perceive 1
often 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
encourage 1
his 1
children 1
as 1
sometimes 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
he 1
called 1
them 1
to 1
cast 1
off 1
their 1
melancholy 1
He 1
would 1
talk 1
in 1
a 1
cheerful 1
accent 1
with 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
goodness 1
that 1
bestowed 1
pleasure 1
even 1
upon 1
me 1
Agatha 1
listened 1
with 1
respect 1
her 1
eyes 1
sometimes 1
filled 1
with 1
tears 1
which 1
she 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
wipe 1
away 1
unperceived 1
but 1
I 1
generally 1
found 1
that 1
her 1
countenance 1
and 1
tone 1
were 1
more 1
cheerful 1
after 1
having 1
listened 1
to 1
the 1
exhortations 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
thus 1
with 1
Felix 1
He 1
was 1
always 1
the 1
saddest 1
of 1
the 1
group 1
and 1
even 1
to 1
my 1
unpractised 1
senses 1
he 1
appeared 1
to 1
have 1
suffered 1
more 1
deeply 1
than 1
his 1
friends 1
But 1
if 1
his 1
countenance 1
was 1
more 1
sorrowful 1
his 1
voice 1
was 1
more 1
cheerful 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
his 1
sister 1
especially 1
when 1
he 1
addressed 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
I 1
could 1
mention 1
innumerable 1
instances 1
which 1
although 1
slight 1
marked 1
the 1
dispositions 1
of 1
these 1
amiable 1
cottagers 1
In 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
poverty 1
and 1
want 1
Felix 1
carried 1
with 1
pleasure 1
to 1
his 1
sister 1
the 1
first 1
little 1
white 1
flower 1
that 1
peeped 1
out 1
from 1
beneath 1
the 1
snowy 1
ground 1
Early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
before 1
she 1
had 1
risen 1
he 1
cleared 1
away 1
the 1
snow 1
that 1
obstructed 1
her 1
path 1
to 1
the 1
milk 1
house 1
drew 1
water 1
from 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
brought 1
the 1
wood 1
from 1
the 1
outhouse 1
where 1
to 1
his 1
perpetual 1
astonishment 1
he 1
found 1
his 1
store 1
always 1
replenished 1
by 1
an 1
invisible 1
hand 1
In 1
the 1
day 1
I 1
believe 1
he 1
worked 1
sometimes 1
for 1
a 1
neighbouring 1
farmer 1
because 1
he 1
often 1
went 1
forth 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
return 1
until 1
dinner 1
yet 1
brought 1
no 1
wood 1
with 1
him 1
At 1
other 1
times 1
he 1
worked 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
but 1
as 1
there 1
was 1
little 1
to 1
do 1
in 1
the 1
frosty 1
season 1
he 1
read 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
and 1
Agatha 1
This 1
reading 1
had 1
puzzled 1
me 1
extremely 1
at 1
first 1
but 1
by 1
degrees 1
I 1
discovered 1
that 1
he 1
uttered 1
many 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
sounds 1
when 1
he 1
read 1
as 1
when 1
he 1
talked 1
I 1
conjectured 1
therefore 1
that 1
he 1
found 1
on 1
the 1
paper 1
signs 1
for 1
speech 1
which 1
he 1
understood 1
and 1
I 1
ardently 1
longed 1
to 1
comprehend 1
these 1
also 1
but 1
how 1
was 1
that 1
possible 1
when 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
even 1
understand 1
the 1
sounds 1
for 1
which 1
they 1
stood 1
as 1
signs 1
I 1
improved 1
however 1
sensibly 1
in 1
this 1
science 1
but 1
not 1
sufficiently 1
to 1
follow 1
up 1
any 1
kind 1
of 1
conversation 1
although 1
I 1
applied 1
my 1
whole 1
mind 1
to 1
the 1
endeavour 1
for 1
I 1
easily 1
perceived 1
that 1
although 1
I 1
eagerly 1
longed 1
to 1
discover 1
myself 1
to 1
the 1
cottagers 1
I 1
ought 1
not 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
attempt 1
until 1
I 1
had 1
first 1
become 1
master 1
of 1
their 1
language 1
which 1
knowledge 1
might 1
enable 1
me 1
to 1
make 1
them 1
overlook 1
the 1
deformity 1
of 1
my 1
figure 1
for 1
with 1
this 1
also 1
the 1
contrast 1
perpetually 1
presented 1
to 1
my 1
eyes 1
had 1
made 1
me 1
acquainted 1
I 1
had 1
admired 1
the 1
perfect 1
forms 1
of 1
my 1
cottagers 1
their 1
grace 1
beauty 1
and 1
delicate 1
complexions 1
but 1
how 1
was 1
I 1
terrified 1
when 1
I 1
viewed 1
myself 1
in 1
a 1
transparent 1
pool 1
At 1
first 1
I 1
started 1
back 1
unable 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
indeed 1
I 1
who 1
was 1
reflected 1
in 1
the 1
mirror 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
became 1
fully 1
convinced 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
reality 1
the 1
monster 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
I 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
the 1
bitterest 1
sensations 1
of 1
despondence 1
and 1
mortification 1
Alas 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
yet 1
entirely 1
know 1
the 1
fatal 1
effects 1
of 1
this 1
miserable 1
deformity 1
As 1
the 1
sun 1
became 1
warmer 1
and 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
day 1
longer 1
the 1
snow 1
vanished 1
and 1
I 1
beheld 1
the 1
bare 1
trees 1
and 1
the 1
black 1
earth 1
From 1
this 1
time 1
Felix 1
was 1
more 1
employed 1
and 1
the 1
heart 1
moving 1
indications 1
of 1
impending 1
famine 1
disappeared 1
Their 1
food 1
as 1
I 1
afterwards 1
found 1
was 1
coarse 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
wholesome 1
and 1
they 1
procured 1
a 1
sufficiency 1
of 1
it 1
Several 1
new 1
kinds 1
of 1
plants 1
sprang 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
which 1
they 1
dressed 1
and 1
these 1
signs 1
of 1
comfort 1
increased 1
daily 1
as 1
the 1
season 1
advanced 1
The 1
old 1
man 1
leaning 1
on 1
his 1
son 1
walked 1
each 1
day 1
at 1
noon 1
when 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
rain 1
as 1
I 1
found 1
it 1
was 1
called 1
when 1
the 1
heavens 1
poured 1
forth 1
its 1
waters 1
This 1
frequently 1
took 1
place 1
but 1
a 1
high 1
wind 1
quickly 1
dried 1
the 1
earth 1
and 1
the 1
season 1
became 1
far 1
more 1
pleasant 1
than 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
My 1
mode 1
of 1
life 1
in 1
my 1
hovel 1
was 1
uniform 1
During 1
the 1
morning 1
I 1
attended 1
the 1
motions 1
of 1
the 1
cottagers 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
dispersed 1
in 1
various 1
occupations 1
I 1
slept 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
was 1
spent 1
in 1
observing 1
my 1
friends 1
When 1
they 1
had 1
retired 1
to 1
rest 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
any 1
moon 1
or 1
the 1
night 1
was 1
star 1
light 1
I 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
collected 1
my 1
own 1
food 1
and 1
fuel 1
for 1
the 1
cottage 1
When 1
I 1
returned 1
as 1
often 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
necessary 1
I 1
cleared 1
their 1
path 1
from 1
the 1
snow 1
and 1
performed 1
those 1
offices 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
seen 1
done 1
by 1
Felix 1
I 1
afterwards 1
found 1
that 1
these 1
labours 1
performed 1
by 1
an 1
invisible 1
hand 1
greatly 1
astonished 1
them 1
and 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
I 1
heard 1
them 1
on 1
these 1
occasions 1
utter 1
the 1
words 1
good 1
spirit 1
wonderful 1
but 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
then 1
understand 1
the 1
signification 1
of 1
these 1
terms 1
My 1
thoughts 1
now 1
became 1
more 1
active 1
and 1
I 1
longed 1
to 1
discover 1
the 1
motives 1
and 1
feelings 1
of 1
these 1
lovely 1
creatures 1
I 1
was 1
inquisitive 1
to 1
know 1
why 1
Felix 1
appeared 1
so 1
miserable 1
and 1
Agatha 1
so 1
sad 1
I 1
thought 1
foolish 1
wretch 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
to 1
restore 1
happiness 1
to 1
these 1
deserving 1
people 1
When 1
I 1
slept 1
or 1
was 1
absent 1
the 1
forms 1
of 1
the 1
venerable 1
blind 1
father 1
the 1
gentle 1
Agatha 1
and 1
the 1
excellent 1
Felix 1
flitted 1
before 1
me 1
I 1
looked 1
upon 1
them 1
as 1
superior 1
beings 1
who 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
arbiters 1
of 1
my 1
future 1
destiny 1
I 1
formed 1
in 1
my 1
imagination 1
a 1
thousand 1
pictures 1
of 1
presenting 1
myself 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
their 1
reception 1
of 1
me 1
I 1
imagined 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
disgusted 1
until 1
by 1
my 1
gentle 1
demeanour 1
and 1
conciliating 1
words 1
I 1
should 1
first 1
win 1
their 1
favour 1
and 1
afterwards 1
their 1
love 1
These 1
thoughts 1
exhilarated 1
me 1
and 1
led 1
me 1
to 1
apply 1
with 1
fresh 1
ardour 1
to 1
the 1
acquiring 1
the 1
art 1
of 1
language 1
My 1
organs 1
were 1
indeed 1
harsh 1
but 1
supple 1
and 1
although 1
my 1
voice 1
was 1
very 1
unlike 1
the 1
soft 1
music 1
of 1
their 1
tones 1
yet 1
I 1
pronounced 1
such 1
words 1
as 1
I 1
understood 1
with 1
tolerable 1
ease 1
It 1
was 1
as 1
the 1
ass 1
and 1
the 1
lap 1
dog 1
yet 1
surely 1
the 1
gentle 1
ass 1
whose 1
intentions 1
were 1
affectionate 1
although 1
his 1
manners 1
were 1
rude 1
deserved 1
better 1
treatment 1
than 1
blows 1
and 1
execration 1
The 1
pleasant 1
showers 1
and 1
genial 1
warmth 1
of 1
spring 1
greatly 1
altered 1
the 1
aspect 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
Men 1
who 1
before 1
this 1
change 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
hid 1
in 1
caves 1
dispersed 1
themselves 1
and 1
were 1
employed 1
in 1
various 1
arts 1
of 1
cultivation 1
The 1
birds 1
sang 1
in 1
more 1
cheerful 1
notes 1
and 1
the 1
leaves 1
began 1
to 1
bud 1
forth 1
on 1
the 1
trees 1
Happy 1
happy 1
earth 1
Fit 1
habitation 1
for 1
gods 1
which 1
so 1
short 1
a 1
time 1
before 1
was 1
bleak 1
damp 1
and 1
unwholesome 1
My 1
spirits 1
were 1
elevated 1
by 1
the 1
enchanting 1
appearance 1
of 1
nature 1
the 1
past 1
was 1
blotted 1
from 1
my 1
memory 1
the 1
present 1
was 1
tranquil 1
and 1
the 1
future 1
gilded 1
by 1
bright 1
rays 1
of 1
hope 1
and 1
anticipations 1
of 1
joy 1
Chapter 1
I 1
now 1
hasten 1
to 1
the 1
more 1
moving 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
story 1
I 1
shall 1
relate 1
events 1
that 1
impressed 1
me 1
with 1
feelings 1
which 1
from 1
what 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
have 1
made 1
me 1
what 1
I 1
am 1
Spring 1
advanced 1
rapidly 1
the 1
weather 1
became 1
fine 1
and 1
the 1
skies 1
cloudless 1
It 1
surprised 1
me 1
that 1
what 1
before 1
was 1
desert 1
and 1
gloomy 1
should 1
now 1
bloom 1
with 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
flowers 1
and 1
verdure 1
My 1
senses 1
were 1
gratified 1
and 1
refreshed 1
by 1
a 1
thousand 1
scents 1
of 1
delight 1
and 1
a 1
thousand 1
sights 1
of 1
beauty 1
It 1
was 1
on 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
days 1
when 1
my 1
cottagers 1
periodically 1
rested 1
from 1
labour 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
played 1
on 1
his 1
guitar 1
and 1
the 1
children 1
listened 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
I 1
observed 1
the 1
countenance 1
of 1
Felix 1
was 1
melancholy 1
beyond 1
expression 1
he 1
sighed 1
frequently 1
and 1
once 1
his 1
father 1
paused 1
in 1
his 1
music 1
and 1
I 1
conjectured 1
by 1
his 1
manner 1
that 1
he 1
inquired 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
his 1
son 1
s 1
sorrow 1
Felix 1
replied 1
in 1
a 1
cheerful 1
accent 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
was 1
recommencing 1
his 1
music 1
when 1
someone 1
tapped 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
lady 1
on 1
horseback 1
accompanied 1
by 1
a 1
country 1
man 1
as 1
a 1
guide 1
The 1
lady 1
was 1
dressed 1
in 1
a 1
dark 1
suit 1
and 1
covered 1
with 1
a 1
thick 1
black 1
veil 1
Agatha 1
asked 1
a 1
question 1
to 1
which 1
the 1
stranger 1
only 1
replied 1
by 1
pronouncing 1
in 1
a 1
sweet 1
accent 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
Felix 1
Her 1
voice 1
was 1
musical 1
but 1
unlike 1
that 1
of 1
either 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
On 1
hearing 1
this 1
word 1
Felix 1
came 1
up 1
hastily 1
to 1
the 1
lady 1
who 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
him 1
threw 1
up 1
her 1
veil 1
and 1
I 1
beheld 1
a 1
countenance 1
of 1
angelic 1
beauty 1
and 1
expression 1
Her 1
hair 1
of 1
a 1
shining 1
raven 1
black 1
and 1
curiously 1
braided 1
her 1
eyes 1
were 1
dark 1
but 1
gentle 1
although 1
animated 1
her 1
features 1
of 1
a 1
regular 1
proportion 1
and 1
her 1
complexion 1
wondrously 1
fair 1
each 1
cheek 1
tinged 1
with 1
a 1
lovely 1
pink 1
Felix 1
seemed 1
ravished 1
with 1
delight 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
her 1
every 1
trait 1
of 1
sorrow 1
vanished 1
from 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
it 1
instantly 1
expressed 1
a 1
degree 1
of 1
ecstatic 1
joy 1
of 1
which 1
I 1
could 1
hardly 1
have 1
believed 1
it 1
capable 1
his 1
eyes 1
sparkled 1
as 1
his 1
cheek 1
flushed 1
with 1
pleasure 1
and 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
I 1
thought 1
him 1
as 1
beautiful 1
as 1
the 1
stranger 1
She 1
appeared 1
affected 1
by 1
different 1
feelings 1
wiping 1
a 1
few 1
tears 1
from 1
her 1
lovely 1
eyes 1
she 1
held 1
out 1
her 1
hand 1
to 1
Felix 1
who 1
kissed 1
it 1
rapturously 1
and 1
called 1
her 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
distinguish 1
his 1
sweet 1
Arabian 1
She 1
did 1
not 1
appear 1
to 1
understand 1
him 1
but 1
smiled 1
He 1
assisted 1
her 1
to 1
dismount 1
and 1
dismissing 1
her 1
guide 1
conducted 1
her 1
into 1
the 1
cottage 1
Some 1
conversation 1
took 1
place 1
between 1
him 1
and 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
the 1
young 1
stranger 1
knelt 1
at 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
s 1
feet 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
kissed 1
his 1
hand 1
but 1
he 1
raised 1
her 1
and 1
embraced 1
her 1
affectionately 1
I 1
soon 1
perceived 1
that 1
although 1
the 1
stranger 1
uttered 1
articulate 1
sounds 1
and 1
appeared 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
language 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
she 1
was 1
neither 1
understood 1
by 1
nor 1
herself 1
understood 1
the 1
cottagers 1
They 1
made 1
many 1
signs 1
which 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
comprehend 1
but 1
I 1
saw 1
that 1
her 1
presence 1
diffused 1
gladness 1
through 1
the 1
cottage 1
dispelling 1
their 1
sorrow 1
as 1
the 1
sun 1
dissipates 1
the 1
morning 1
mists 1
Felix 1
seemed 1
peculiarly 1
happy 1
and 1
with 1
smiles 1
of 1
delight 1
welcomed 1
his 1
Arabian 1
Agatha 1
the 1
ever 1
gentle 1
Agatha 1
kissed 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
the 1
lovely 1
stranger 1
and 1
pointing 1
to 1
her 1
brother 1
made 1
signs 1
which 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
mean 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
sorrowful 1
until 1
she 1
came 1
Some 1
hours 1
passed 1
thus 1
while 1
they 1
by 1
their 1
countenances 1
expressed 1
joy 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
which 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
comprehend 1
Presently 1
I 1
found 1
by 1
the 1
frequent 1
recurrence 1
of 1
some 1
sound 1
which 1
the 1
stranger 1
repeated 1
after 1
them 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
learn 1
their 1
language 1
and 1
the 1
idea 1
instantly 1
occurred 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
make 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
instructions 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
end 1
The 1
stranger 1
learned 1
about 1
twenty 1
words 1
at 1
the 1
first 1
lesson 1
most 1
of 1
them 1
indeed 1
were 1
those 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
before 1
understood 1
but 1
I 1
profited 1
by 1
the 1
others 1
As 1
night 1
came 1
on 1
Agatha 1
and 1
the 1
Arabian 1
retired 1
early 1
When 1
they 1
separated 1
Felix 1
kissed 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
the 1
stranger 1
and 1
said 1
Good 1
night 1
sweet 1
Safie 1
He 1
sat 1
up 1
much 1
longer 1
conversing 1
with 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
frequent 1
repetition 1
of 1
her 1
name 1
I 1
conjectured 1
that 1
their 1
lovely 1
guest 1
was 1
the 1
subject 1
of 1
their 1
conversation 1
I 1
ardently 1
desired 1
to 1
understand 1
them 1
and 1
bent 1
every 1
faculty 1
towards 1
that 1
purpose 1
but 1
found 1
it 1
utterly 1
impossible 1
The 1
next 1
morning 1
Felix 1
went 1
out 1
to 1
his 1
work 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
usual 1
occupations 1
of 1
Agatha 1
were 1
finished 1
the 1
Arabian 1
sat 1
at 1
the 1
feet 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
and 1
taking 1
his 1
guitar 1
played 1
some 1
airs 1
so 1
entrancingly 1
beautiful 1
that 1
they 1
at 1
once 1
drew 1
tears 1
of 1
sorrow 1
and 1
delight 1
from 1
my 1
eyes 1
She 1
sang 1
and 1
her 1
voice 1
flowed 1
in 1
a 1
rich 1
cadence 1
swelling 1
or 1
dying 1
away 1
like 1
a 1
nightingale 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
When 1
she 1
had 1
finished 1
she 1
gave 1
the 1
guitar 1
to 1
Agatha 1
who 1
at 1
first 1
declined 1
it 1
She 1
played 1
a 1
simple 1
air 1
and 1
her 1
voice 1
accompanied 1
it 1
in 1
sweet 1
accents 1
but 1
unlike 1
the 1
wondrous 1
strain 1
of 1
the 1
stranger 1
The 1
old 1
man 1
appeared 1
enraptured 1
and 1
said 1
some 1
words 1
which 1
Agatha 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
explain 1
to 1
Safie 1
and 1
by 1
which 1
he 1
appeared 1
to 1
wish 1
to 1
express 1
that 1
she 1
bestowed 1
on 1
him 1
the 1
greatest 1
delight 1
by 1
her 1
music 1
The 1
days 1
now 1
passed 1
as 1
peaceably 1
as 1
before 1
with 1
the 1
sole 1
alteration 1
that 1
joy 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
of 1
sadness 1
in 1
the 1
countenances 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
Safie 1
was 1
always 1
gay 1
and 1
happy 1
she 1
and 1
I 1
improved 1
rapidly 1
in 1
the 1
knowledge 1
of 1
language 1
so 1
that 1
in 1
two 1
months 1
I 1
began 1
to 1
comprehend 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
words 1
uttered 1
by 1
my 1
protectors 1
In 1
the 1
meanwhile 1
also 1
the 1
black 1
ground 1
was 1
covered 1
with 1
herbage 1
and 1
the 1
green 1
banks 1
interspersed 1
with 1
innumerable 1
flowers 1
sweet 1
to 1
the 1
scent 1
and 1
the 1
eyes 1
stars 1
of 1
pale 1
radiance 1
among 1
the 1
moonlight 1
woods 1
the 1
sun 1
became 1
warmer 1
the 1
nights 1
clear 1
and 1
balmy 1
and 1
my 1
nocturnal 1
rambles 1
were 1
an 1
extreme 1
pleasure 1
to 1
me 1
although 1
they 1
were 1
considerably 1
shortened 1
by 1
the 1
late 1
setting 1
and 1
early 1
rising 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
for 1
I 1
never 1
ventured 1
abroad 1
during 1
daylight 1
fearful 1
of 1
meeting 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
treatment 1
I 1
had 1
formerly 1
endured 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
village 1
which 1
I 1
entered 1
My 1
days 1
were 1
spent 1
in 1
close 1
attention 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
more 1
speedily 1
master 1
the 1
language 1
and 1
I 1
may 1
boast 1
that 1
I 1
improved 1
more 1
rapidly 1
than 1
the 1
Arabian 1
who 1
understood 1
very 1
little 1
and 1
conversed 1
in 1
broken 1
accents 1
whilst 1
I 1
comprehended 1
and 1
could 1
imitate 1
almost 1
every 1
word 1
that 1
was 1
spoken 1
While 1
I 1
improved 1
in 1
speech 1
I 1
also 1
learned 1
the 1
science 1
of 1
letters 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
taught 1
to 1
the 1
stranger 1
and 1
this 1
opened 1
before 1
me 1
a 1
wide 1
field 1
for 1
wonder 1
and 1
delight 1
The 1
book 1
from 1
which 1
Felix 1
instructed 1
Safie 1
was 1
Volney 1
s 1
Ruins 1
of 1
Empires 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
have 1
understood 1
the 1
purport 1
of 1
this 1
book 1
had 1
not 1
Felix 1
in 1
reading 1
it 1
given 1
very 1
minute 1
explanations 1
He 1
had 1
chosen 1
this 1
work 1
he 1
said 1
because 1
the 1
declamatory 1
style 1
was 1
framed 1
in 1
imitation 1
of 1
the 1
Eastern 1
authors 1
Through 1
this 1
work 1
I 1
obtained 1
a 1
cursory 1
knowledge 1
of 1
history 1
and 1
a 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
several 1
empires 1
at 1
present 1
existing 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
it 1
gave 1
me 1
an 1
insight 1
into 1
the 1
manners 1
governments 1
and 1
religions 1
of 1
the 1
different 1
nations 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
I 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
slothful 1
Asiatics 1
of 1
the 1
stupendous 1
genius 1
and 1
mental 1
activity 1
of 1
the 1
Grecians 1
of 1
the 1
wars 1
and 1
wonderful 1
virtue 1
of 1
the 1
early 1
Romans 1
of 1
their 1
subsequent 1
degenerating 1
of 1
the 1
decline 1
of 1
that 1
mighty 1
empire 1
of 1
chivalry 1
Christianity 1
and 1
kings 1
I 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
discovery 1
of 1
the 1
American 1
hemisphere 1
and 1
wept 1
with 1
Safie 1
over 1
the 1
hapless 1
fate 1
of 1
its 1
original 1
inhabitants 1
These 1
wonderful 1
narrations 1
inspired 1
me 1
with 1
strange 1
feelings 1
Was 1
man 1
indeed 1
at 1
once 1
so 1
powerful 1
so 1
virtuous 1
and 1
magnificent 1
yet 1
so 1
vicious 1
and 1
base 1
He 1
appeared 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
a 1
mere 1
scion 1
of 1
the 1
evil 1
principle 1
and 1
at 1
another 1
as 1
all 1
that 1
can 1
be 1
conceived 1
of 1
noble 1
and 1
godlike 1
To 1
be 1
a 1
great 1
and 1
virtuous 1
man 1
appeared 1
the 1
highest 1
honour 1
that 1
can 1
befall 1
a 1
sensitive 1
being 1
to 1
be 1
base 1
and 1
vicious 1
as 1
many 1
on 1
record 1
have 1
been 1
appeared 1
the 1
lowest 1
degradation 1
a 1
condition 1
more 1
abject 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
blind 1
mole 1
or 1
harmless 1
worm 1
For 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
conceive 1
how 1
one 1
man 1
could 1
go 1
forth 1
to 1
murder 1
his 1
fellow 1
or 1
even 1
why 1
there 1
were 1
laws 1
and 1
governments 1
but 1
when 1
I 1
heard 1
details 1
of 1
vice 1
and 1
bloodshed 1
my 1
wonder 1
ceased 1
and 1
I 1
turned 1
away 1
with 1
disgust 1
and 1
loathing 1
Every 1
conversation 1
of 1
the 1
cottagers 1
now 1
opened 1
new 1
wonders 1
to 1
me 1
While 1
I 1
listened 1
to 1
the 1
instructions 1
which 1
Felix 1
bestowed 1
upon 1
the 1
Arabian 1
the 1
strange 1
system 1
of 1
human 1
society 1
was 1
explained 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
division 1
of 1
property 1
of 1
immense 1
wealth 1
and 1
squalid 1
poverty 1
of 1
rank 1
descent 1
and 1
noble 1
blood 1
The 1
words 1
induced 1
me 1
to 1
turn 1
towards 1
myself 1
I 1
learned 1
that 1
the 1
possessions 1
most 1
esteemed 1
by 1
your 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
were 1
high 1
and 1
unsullied 1
descent 1
united 1
with 1
riches 1
A 1
man 1
might 1
be 1
respected 1
with 1
only 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
advantages 1
but 1
without 1
either 1
he 1
was 1
considered 1
except 1
in 1
very 1
rare 1
instances 1
as 1
a 1
vagabond 1
and 1
a 1
slave 1
doomed 1
to 1
waste 1
his 1
powers 1
for 1
the 1
profits 1
of 1
the 1
chosen 1
few 1
And 1
what 1
was 1
I 1
Of 1
my 1
creation 1
and 1
creator 1
I 1
was 1
absolutely 1
ignorant 1
but 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
I 1
possessed 1
no 1
money 1
no 1
friends 1
no 1
kind 1
of 1
property 1
I 1
was 1
besides 1
endued 1
with 1
a 1
figure 1
hideously 1
deformed 1
and 1
loathsome 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
even 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
nature 1
as 1
man 1
I 1
was 1
more 1
agile 1
than 1
they 1
and 1
could 1
subsist 1
upon 1
coarser 1
diet 1
I 1
bore 1
the 1
extremes 1
of 1
heat 1
and 1
cold 1
with 1
less 1
injury 1
to 1
my 1
frame 1
my 1
stature 1
far 1
exceeded 1
theirs 1
When 1
I 1
looked 1
around 1
I 1
saw 1
and 1
heard 1
of 1
none 1
like 1
me 1
Was 1
I 1
then 1
a 1
monster 1
a 1
blot 1
upon 1
the 1
earth 1
from 1
which 1
all 1
men 1
fled 1
and 1
whom 1
all 1
men 1
disowned 1
I 1
cannot 1
describe 1
to 1
you 1
the 1
agony 1
that 1
these 1
reflections 1
inflicted 1
upon 1
me 1
I 1
tried 1
to 1
dispel 1
them 1
but 1
sorrow 1
only 1
increased 1
with 1
knowledge 1
Oh 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
forever 1
remained 1
in 1
my 1
native 1
wood 1
nor 1
known 1
nor 1
felt 1
beyond 1
the 1
sensations 1
of 1
hunger 1
thirst 1
and 1
heat 1
Of 1
what 1
a 1
strange 1
nature 1
is 1
knowledge 1
It 1
clings 1
to 1
the 1
mind 1
when 1
it 1
has 1
once 1
seized 1
on 1
it 1
like 1
a 1
lichen 1
on 1
the 1
rock 1
I 1
wished 1
sometimes 1
to 1
shake 1
off 1
all 1
thought 1
and 1
feeling 1
but 1
I 1
learned 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
but 1
one 1
means 1
to 1
overcome 1
the 1
sensation 1
of 1
pain 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
death 1
a 1
state 1
which 1
I 1
feared 1
yet 1
did 1
not 1
understand 1
I 1
admired 1
virtue 1
and 1
good 1
feelings 1
and 1
loved 1
the 1
gentle 1
manners 1
and 1
amiable 1
qualities 1
of 1
my 1
cottagers 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
shut 1
out 1
from 1
intercourse 1
with 1
them 1
except 1
through 1
means 1
which 1
I 1
obtained 1
by 1
stealth 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
unseen 1
and 1
unknown 1
and 1
which 1
rather 1
increased 1
than 1
satisfied 1
the 1
desire 1
I 1
had 1
of 1
becoming 1
one 1
among 1
my 1
fellows 1
The 1
gentle 1
words 1
of 1
Agatha 1
and 1
the 1
animated 1
smiles 1
of 1
the 1
charming 1
Arabian 1
were 1
not 1
for 1
me 1
The 1
mild 1
exhortations 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
and 1
the 1
lively 1
conversation 1
of 1
the 1
loved 1
Felix 1
were 1
not 1
for 1
me 1
Miserable 1
unhappy 1
wretch 1
Other 1
lessons 1
were 1
impressed 1
upon 1
me 1
even 1
more 1
deeply 1
I 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
difference 1
of 1
sexes 1
and 1
the 1
birth 1
and 1
growth 1
of 1
children 1
how 1
the 1
father 1
doted 1
on 1
the 1
smiles 1
of 1
the 1
infant 1
and 1
the 1
lively 1
sallies 1
of 1
the 1
older 1
child 1
how 1
all 1
the 1
life 1
and 1
cares 1
of 1
the 1
mother 1
were 1
wrapped 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
precious 1
charge 1
how 1
the 1
mind 1
of 1
youth 1
expanded 1
and 1
gained 1
knowledge 1
of 1
brother 1
sister 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
various 1
relationships 1
which 1
bind 1
one 1
human 1
being 1
to 1
another 1
in 1
mutual 1
bonds 1
But 1
where 1
were 1
my 1
friends 1
and 1
relations 1
No 1
father 1
had 1
watched 1
my 1
infant 1
days 1
no 1
mother 1
had 1
blessed 1
me 1
with 1
smiles 1
and 1
caresses 1
or 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
all 1
my 1
past 1
life 1
was 1
now 1
a 1
blot 1
a 1
blind 1
vacancy 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
distinguished 1
nothing 1
From 1
my 1
earliest 1
remembrance 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
as 1
I 1
then 1
was 1
in 1
height 1
and 1
proportion 1
I 1
had 1
never 1
yet 1
seen 1
a 1
being 1
resembling 1
me 1
or 1
who 1
claimed 1
any 1
intercourse 1
with 1
me 1
What 1
was 1
I 1
The 1
question 1
again 1
recurred 1
to 1
be 1
answered 1
only 1
with 1
groans 1
I 1
will 1
soon 1
explain 1
to 1
what 1
these 1
feelings 1
tended 1
but 1
allow 1
me 1
now 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
cottagers 1
whose 1
story 1
excited 1
in 1
me 1
such 1
various 1
feelings 1
of 1
indignation 1
delight 1
and 1
wonder 1
but 1
which 1
all 1
terminated 1
in 1
additional 1
love 1
and 1
reverence 1
for 1
my 1
protectors 1
for 1
so 1
I 1
loved 1
in 1
an 1
innocent 1
half 1
painful 1
self 1
deceit 1
to 1
call 1
them 1
Chapter 1
Some 1
time 1
elapsed 1
before 1
I 1
learned 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
It 1
was 1
one 1
which 1
could 1
not 1
fail 1
to 1
impress 1
itself 1
deeply 1
on 1
my 1
mind 1
unfolding 1
as 1
it 1
did 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
circumstances 1
each 1
interesting 1
and 1
wonderful 1
to 1
one 1
so 1
utterly 1
inexperienced 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
The 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
was 1
De 1
Lacey 1
He 1
was 1
descended 1
from 1
a 1
good 1
family 1
in 1
France 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
lived 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
in 1
affluence 1
respected 1
by 1
his 1
superiors 1
and 1
beloved 1
by 1
his 1
equals 1
His 1
son 1
was 1
bred 1
in 1
the 1
service 1
of 1
his 1
country 1
and 1
Agatha 1
had 1
ranked 1
with 1
ladies 1
of 1
the 1
highest 1
distinction 1
A 1
few 1
months 1
before 1
my 1
arrival 1
they 1
had 1
lived 1
in 1
a 1
large 1
and 1
luxurious 1
city 1
called 1
Paris 1
surrounded 1
by 1
friends 1
and 1
possessed 1
of 1
every 1
enjoyment 1
which 1
virtue 1
refinement 1
of 1
intellect 1
or 1
taste 1
accompanied 1
by 1
a 1
moderate 1
fortune 1
could 1
afford 1
The 1
father 1
of 1
Safie 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
their 1
ruin 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
Turkish 1
merchant 1
and 1
had 1
inhabited 1
Paris 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
when 1
for 1
some 1
reason 1
which 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
learn 1
he 1
became 1
obnoxious 1
to 1
the 1
government 1
He 1
was 1
seized 1
and 1
cast 1
into 1
prison 1
the 1
very 1
day 1
that 1
Safie 1
arrived 1
from 1
Constantinople 1
to 1
join 1
him 1
He 1
was 1
tried 1
and 1
condemned 1
to 1
death 1
The 1
injustice 1
of 1
his 1
sentence 1
was 1
very 1
flagrant 1
all 1
Paris 1
was 1
indignant 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
judged 1
that 1
his 1
religion 1
and 1
wealth 1
rather 1
than 1
the 1
crime 1
alleged 1
against 1
him 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
his 1
condemnation 1
Felix 1
had 1
accidentally 1
been 1
present 1
at 1
the 1
trial 1
his 1
horror 1
and 1
indignation 1
were 1
uncontrollable 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
decision 1
of 1
the 1
court 1
He 1
made 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
a 1
solemn 1
vow 1
to 1
deliver 1
him 1
and 1
then 1
looked 1
around 1
for 1
the 1
means 1
After 1
many 1
fruitless 1
attempts 1
to 1
gain 1
admittance 1
to 1
the 1
prison 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
strongly 1
grated 1
window 1
in 1
an 1
unguarded 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
building 1
which 1
lighted 1
the 1
dungeon 1
of 1
the 1
unfortunate 1
Muhammadan 1
who 1
loaded 1
with 1
chains 1
waited 1
in 1
despair 1
the 1
execution 1
of 1
the 1
barbarous 1
sentence 1
Felix 1
visited 1
the 1
grate 1
at 1
night 1
and 1
made 1
known 1
to 1
the 1
prisoner 1
his 1
intentions 1
in 1
his 1
favour 1
The 1
Turk 1
amazed 1
and 1
delighted 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
kindle 1
the 1
zeal 1
of 1
his 1
deliverer 1
by 1
promises 1
of 1
reward 1
and 1
wealth 1
Felix 1
rejected 1
his 1
offers 1
with 1
contempt 1
yet 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
lovely 1
Safie 1
who 1
was 1
allowed 1
to 1
visit 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
who 1
by 1
her 1
gestures 1
expressed 1
her 1
lively 1
gratitude 1
the 1
youth 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
owning 1
to 1
his 1
own 1
mind 1
that 1
the 1
captive 1
possessed 1
a 1
treasure 1
which 1
would 1
fully 1
reward 1
his 1
toil 1
and 1
hazard 1
The 1
Turk 1
quickly 1
perceived 1
the 1
impression 1
that 1
his 1
daughter 1
had 1
made 1
on 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
Felix 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
secure 1
him 1
more 1
entirely 1
in 1
his 1
interests 1
by 1
the 1
promise 1
of 1
her 1
hand 1
in 1
marriage 1
so 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
conveyed 1
to 1
a 1
place 1
of 1
safety 1
Felix 1
was 1
too 1
delicate 1
to 1
accept 1
this 1
offer 1
yet 1
he 1
looked 1
forward 1
to 1
the 1
probability 1
of 1
the 1
event 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
consummation 1
of 1
his 1
happiness 1
During 1
the 1
ensuing 1
days 1
while 1
the 1
preparations 1
were 1
going 1
forward 1
for 1
the 1
escape 1
of 1
the 1
merchant 1
the 1
zeal 1
of 1
Felix 1
was 1
warmed 1
by 1
several 1
letters 1
that 1
he 1
received 1
from 1
this 1
lovely 1
girl 1
who 1
found 1
means 1
to 1
express 1
her 1
thoughts 1
in 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
her 1
lover 1
by 1
the 1
aid 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
man 1
a 1
servant 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
who 1
understood 1
French 1
She 1
thanked 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
ardent 1
terms 1
for 1
his 1
intended 1
services 1
towards 1
her 1
parent 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
she 1
gently 1
deplored 1
her 1
own 1
fate 1
I 1
have 1
copies 1
of 1
these 1
letters 1
for 1
I 1
found 1
means 1
during 1
my 1
residence 1
in 1
the 1
hovel 1
to 1
procure 1
the 1
implements 1
of 1
writing 1
and 1
the 1
letters 1
were 1
often 1
in 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
Felix 1
or 1
Agatha 1
Before 1
I 1
depart 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
them 1
to 1
you 1
they 1
will 1
prove 1
the 1
truth 1
of 1
my 1
tale 1
but 1
at 1
present 1
as 1
the 1
sun 1
is 1
already 1
far 1
declined 1
I 1
shall 1
only 1
have 1
time 1
to 1
repeat 1
the 1
substance 1
of 1
them 1
to 1
you 1
Safie 1
related 1
that 1
her 1
mother 1
was 1
a 1
Christian 1
Arab 1
seized 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
slave 1
by 1
the 1
Turks 1
recommended 1
by 1
her 1
beauty 1
she 1
had 1
won 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
the 1
father 1
of 1
Safie 1
who 1
married 1
her 1
The 1
young 1
girl 1
spoke 1
in 1
high 1
and 1
enthusiastic 1
terms 1
of 1
her 1
mother 1
who 1
born 1
in 1
freedom 1
spurned 1
the 1
bondage 1
to 1
which 1
she 1
was 1
now 1
reduced 1
She 1
instructed 1
her 1
daughter 1
in 1
the 1
tenets 1
of 1
her 1
religion 1
and 1
taught 1
her 1
to 1
aspire 1
to 1
higher 1
powers 1
of 1
intellect 1
and 1
an 1
independence 1
of 1
spirit 1
forbidden 1
to 1
the 1
female 1
followers 1
of 1
Muhammad 1
This 1
lady 1
died 1
but 1
her 1
lessons 1
were 1
indelibly 1
impressed 1
on 1
the 1
mind 1
of 1
Safie 1
who 1
sickened 1
at 1
the 1
prospect 1
of 1
again 1
returning 1
to 1
Asia 1
and 1
being 1
immured 1
within 1
the 1
walls 1
of 1
a 1
harem 1
allowed 1
only 1
to 1
occupy 1
herself 1
with 1
infantile 1
amusements 1
ill 1
suited 1
to 1
the 1
temper 1
of 1
her 1
soul 1
now 1
accustomed 1
to 1
grand 1
ideas 1
and 1
a 1
noble 1
emulation 1
for 1
virtue 1
The 1
prospect 1
of 1
marrying 1
a 1
Christian 1
and 1
remaining 1
in 1
a 1
country 1
where 1
women 1
were 1
allowed 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
rank 1
in 1
society 1
was 1
enchanting 1
to 1
her 1
The 1
day 1
for 1
the 1
execution 1
of 1
the 1
Turk 1
was 1
fixed 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
night 1
previous 1
to 1
it 1
he 1
quitted 1
his 1
prison 1
and 1
before 1
morning 1
was 1
distant 1
many 1
leagues 1
from 1
Paris 1
Felix 1
had 1
procured 1
passports 1
in 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
his 1
father 1
sister 1
and 1
himself 1
He 1
had 1
previously 1
communicated 1
his 1
plan 1
to 1
the 1
former 1
who 1
aided 1
the 1
deceit 1
by 1
quitting 1
his 1
house 1
under 1
the 1
pretence 1
of 1
a 1
journey 1
and 1
concealed 1
himself 1
with 1
his 1
daughter 1
in 1
an 1
obscure 1
part 1
of 1
Paris 1
Felix 1
conducted 1
the 1
fugitives 1
through 1
France 1
to 1
Lyons 1
and 1
across 1
Mont 1
Cenis 1
to 1
Leghorn 1
where 1
the 1
merchant 1
had 1
decided 1
to 1
wait 1
a 1
favourable 1
opportunity 1
of 1
passing 1
into 1
some 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
Turkish 1
dominions 1
Safie 1
resolved 1
to 1
remain 1
with 1
her 1
father 1
until 1
the 1
moment 1
of 1
his 1
departure 1
before 1
which 1
time 1
the 1
Turk 1
renewed 1
his 1
promise 1
that 1
she 1
should 1
be 1
united 1
to 1
his 1
deliverer 1
and 1
Felix 1
remained 1
with 1
them 1
in 1
expectation 1
of 1
that 1
event 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
he 1
enjoyed 1
the 1
society 1
of 1
the 1
Arabian 1
who 1
exhibited 1
towards 1
him 1
the 1
simplest 1
and 1
tenderest 1
affection 1
They 1
conversed 1
with 1
one 1
another 1
through 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
an 1
interpreter 1
and 1
sometimes 1
with 1
the 1
interpretation 1
of 1
looks 1
and 1
Safie 1
sang 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
divine 1
airs 1
of 1
her 1
native 1
country 1
The 1
Turk 1
allowed 1
this 1
intimacy 1
to 1
take 1
place 1
and 1
encouraged 1
the 1
hopes 1
of 1
the 1
youthful 1
lovers 1
while 1
in 1
his 1
heart 1
he 1
had 1
formed 1
far 1
other 1
plans 1
He 1
loathed 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
his 1
daughter 1
should 1
be 1
united 1
to 1
a 1
Christian 1
but 1
he 1
feared 1
the 1
resentment 1
of 1
Felix 1
if 1
he 1
should 1
appear 1
lukewarm 1
for 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
still 1
in 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
his 1
deliverer 1
if 1
he 1
should 1
choose 1
to 1
betray 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
Italian 1
state 1
which 1
they 1
inhabited 1
He 1
revolved 1
a 1
thousand 1
plans 1
by 1
which 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
enabled 1
to 1
prolong 1
the 1
deceit 1
until 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
no 1
longer 1
necessary 1
and 1
secretly 1
to 1
take 1
his 1
daughter 1
with 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
departed 1
His 1
plans 1
were 1
facilitated 1
by 1
the 1
news 1
which 1
arrived 1
from 1
Paris 1
The 1
government 1
of 1
France 1
were 1
greatly 1
enraged 1
at 1
the 1
escape 1
of 1
their 1
victim 1
and 1
spared 1
no 1
pains 1
to 1
detect 1
and 1
punish 1
his 1
deliverer 1
The 1
plot 1
of 1
Felix 1
was 1
quickly 1
discovered 1
and 1
De 1
Lacey 1
and 1
Agatha 1
were 1
thrown 1
into 1
prison 1
The 1
news 1
reached 1
Felix 1
and 1
roused 1
him 1
from 1
his 1
dream 1
of 1
pleasure 1
His 1
blind 1
and 1
aged 1
father 1
and 1
his 1
gentle 1
sister 1
lay 1
in 1
a 1
noisome 1
dungeon 1
while 1
he 1
enjoyed 1
the 1
free 1
air 1
and 1
the 1
society 1
of 1
her 1
whom 1
he 1
loved 1
This 1
idea 1
was 1
torture 1
to 1
him 1
He 1
quickly 1
arranged 1
with 1
the 1
Turk 1
that 1
if 1
the 1
latter 1
should 1
find 1
a 1
favourable 1
opportunity 1
for 1
escape 1
before 1
Felix 1
could 1
return 1
to 1
Italy 1
Safie 1
should 1
remain 1
as 1
a 1
boarder 1
at 1
a 1
convent 1
at 1
Leghorn 1
and 1
then 1
quitting 1
the 1
lovely 1
Arabian 1
he 1
hastened 1
to 1
Paris 1
and 1
delivered 1
himself 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
vengeance 1
of 1
the 1
law 1
hoping 1
to 1
free 1
De 1
Lacey 1
and 1
Agatha 1
by 1
this 1
proceeding 1
He 1
did 1
not 1
succeed 1
They 1
remained 1
confined 1
for 1
five 1
months 1
before 1
the 1
trial 1
took 1
place 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
which 1
deprived 1
them 1
of 1
their 1
fortune 1
and 1
condemned 1
them 1
to 1
a 1
perpetual 1
exile 1
from 1
their 1
native 1
country 1
They 1
found 1
a 1
miserable 1
asylum 1
in 1
the 1
cottage 1
in 1
Germany 1
where 1
I 1
discovered 1
them 1
Felix 1
soon 1
learned 1
that 1
the 1
treacherous 1
Turk 1
for 1
whom 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
family 1
endured 1
such 1
unheard 1
of 1
oppression 1
on 1
discovering 1
that 1
his 1
deliverer 1
was 1
thus 1
reduced 1
to 1
poverty 1
and 1
ruin 1
became 1
a 1
traitor 1
to 1
good 1
feeling 1
and 1
honour 1
and 1
had 1
quitted 1
Italy 1
with 1
his 1
daughter 1
insultingly 1
sending 1
Felix 1
a 1
pittance 1
of 1
money 1
to 1
aid 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
in 1
some 1
plan 1
of 1
future 1
maintenance 1
Such 1
were 1
the 1
events 1
that 1
preyed 1
on 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
Felix 1
and 1
rendered 1
him 1
when 1
I 1
first 1
saw 1
him 1
the 1
most 1
miserable 1
of 1
his 1
family 1
He 1
could 1
have 1
endured 1
poverty 1
and 1
while 1
this 1
distress 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
meed 1
of 1
his 1
virtue 1
he 1
gloried 1
in 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
ingratitude 1
of 1
the 1
Turk 1
and 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
his 1
beloved 1
Safie 1
were 1
misfortunes 1
more 1
bitter 1
and 1
irreparable 1
The 1
arrival 1
of 1
the 1
Arabian 1
now 1
infused 1
new 1
life 1
into 1
his 1
soul 1
When 1
the 1
news 1
reached 1
Leghorn 1
that 1
Felix 1
was 1
deprived 1
of 1
his 1
wealth 1
and 1
rank 1
the 1
merchant 1
commanded 1
his 1
daughter 1
to 1
think 1
no 1
more 1
of 1
her 1
lover 1
but 1
to 1
prepare 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
her 1
native 1
country 1
The 1
generous 1
nature 1
of 1
Safie 1
was 1
outraged 1
by 1
this 1
command 1
she 1
attempted 1
to 1
expostulate 1
with 1
her 1
father 1
but 1
he 1
left 1
her 1
angrily 1
reiterating 1
his 1
tyrannical 1
mandate 1
A 1
few 1
days 1
after 1
the 1
Turk 1
entered 1
his 1
daughter 1
s 1
apartment 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
hastily 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
reason 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
his 1
residence 1
at 1
Leghorn 1
had 1
been 1
divulged 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
speedily 1
be 1
delivered 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
French 1
government 1
he 1
had 1
consequently 1
hired 1
a 1
vessel 1
to 1
convey 1
him 1
to 1
Constantinople 1
for 1
which 1
city 1
he 1
should 1
sail 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
He 1
intended 1
to 1
leave 1
his 1
daughter 1
under 1
the 1
care 1
of 1
a 1
confidential 1
servant 1
to 1
follow 1
at 1
her 1
leisure 1
with 1
the 1
greater 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
property 1
which 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
arrived 1
at 1
Leghorn 1
When 1
alone 1
Safie 1
resolved 1
in 1
her 1
own 1
mind 1
the 1
plan 1
of 1
conduct 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
become 1
her 1
to 1
pursue 1
in 1
this 1
emergency 1
A 1
residence 1
in 1
Turkey 1
was 1
abhorrent 1
to 1
her 2
religion 1
and 1
her 1
feelings 1
were 1
alike 1
averse 1
to 1
it 1
By 1
some 1
papers 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
which 1
fell 1
into 1
her 1
hands 1
she 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
exile 1
of 1
her 1
lover 1
and 1
learnt 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
he 1
then 1
resided 1
She 1
hesitated 1
some 1
time 1
but 1
at 1
length 1
she 1
formed 1
her 1
determination 1
Taking 1
with 1
her 1
some 1
jewels 1
that 1
belonged 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
a 1
sum 1
of 1
money 1
she 1
quitted 1
Italy 1
with 1
an 1
attendant 1
a 1
native 1
of 1
Leghorn 1
but 1
who 1
understood 1
the 1
common 1
language 1
of 1
Turkey 1
and 1
departed 1
for 1
Germany 1
She 1
arrived 1
in 1
safety 1
at 1
a 1
town 1
about 1
twenty 1
leagues 1
from 1
the 1
cottage 1
of 1
De 1
Lacey 1
when 1
her 1
attendant 1
fell 1
dangerously 1
ill 1
Safie 1
nursed 1
her 1
with 1
the 1
most 1
devoted 1
affection 1
but 1
the 1
poor 1
girl 1
died 1
and 1
the 1
Arabian 1
was 1
left 1
alone 1
unacquainted 1
with 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
and 1
utterly 1
ignorant 1
of 1
the 1
customs 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
She 1
fell 1
however 1
into 1
good 1
hands 1
The 1
Italian 1
had 1
mentioned 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
spot 1
for 1
which 1
they 1
were 1
bound 1
and 1
after 1
her 1
death 1
the 1
woman 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
in 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
lived 1
took 1
care 1
that 1
Safie 1
should 1
arrive 1
in 1
safety 1
at 1
the 1
cottage 1
of 1
her 1
lover 1
Chapter 1
Such 1
was 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
my 1
beloved 1
cottagers 1
It 1
impressed 1
me 1
deeply 1
I 1
learned 1
from 1
the 1
views 1
of 1
social 1
life 1
which 1
it 1
developed 1
to 1
admire 1
their 1
virtues 1
and 1
to 1
deprecate 1
the 1
vices 1
of 1
mankind 1
As 1
yet 1
I 1
looked 1
upon 1
crime 1
as 1
a 1
distant 1
evil 1
benevolence 1
and 1
generosity 1
were 1
ever 1
present 1
before 1
me 1
inciting 1
within 1
me 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
become 1
an 1
actor 1
in 1
the 1
busy 1
scene 1
where 1
so 1
many 1
admirable 1
qualities 1
were 1
called 1
forth 1
and 1
displayed 1
But 1
in 1
giving 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
progress 1
of 1
my 1
intellect 1
I 1
must 1
not 1
omit 1
a 1
circumstance 1
which 1
occurred 1
in 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
the 1
month 1
of 1
August 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
year 1
One 1
night 1
during 1
my 1
accustomed 1
visit 1
to 1
the 1
neighbouring 1
wood 1
where 1
I 1
collected 1
my 1
own 1
food 1
and 1
brought 1
home 1
firing 1
for 1
my 1
protectors 1
I 1
found 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
a 1
leathern 1
portmanteau 1
containing 1
several 1
articles 1
of 1
dress 1
and 1
some 1
books 1
I 1
eagerly 1
seized 1
the 1
prize 1
and 1
returned 1
with 1
it 1
to 1
my 1
hovel 1
Fortunately 1
the 1
books 1
were 1
written 1
in 1
the 1
language 1
the 1
elements 1
of 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
acquired 1
at 1
the 1
cottage 1
they 1
consisted 1
of 1
Paradise 1
Lost 1
a 1
volume 1
of 1
Plutarch 1
s 1
Lives 1
and 1
the 1
Sorrows 1
of 1
Werter 1
The 1
possession 1
of 1
these 1
treasures 1
gave 1
me 1
extreme 1
delight 1
I 1
now 1
continually 1
studied 1
and 1
exercised 1
my 1
mind 1
upon 1
these 1
histories 1
whilst 1
my 1
friends 1
were 1
employed 1
in 1
their 1
ordinary 1
occupations 1
I 1
can 1
hardly 1
describe 1
to 1
you 1
the 1
effect 1
of 1
these 1
books 1
They 1
produced 1
in 1
me 1
an 1
infinity 1
of 1
new 1
images 1
and 1
feelings 1
that 1
sometimes 1
raised 1
me 1
to 1
ecstasy 1
but 1
more 1
frequently 1
sunk 1
me 1
into 1
the 1
lowest 1
dejection 1
In 1
the 1
Sorrows 1
of 1
Werter 1
besides 1
the 1
interest 1
of 1
its 1
simple 1
and 1
affecting 1
story 1
so 1
many 1
opinions 1
are 1
canvassed 1
and 1
so 1
many 1
lights 1
thrown 1
upon 1
what 1
had 1
hitherto 1
been 1
to 1
me 1
obscure 1
subjects 1
that 1
I 1
found 1
in 1
it 1
a 1
never 1
ending 1
source 1
of 1
speculation 1
and 1
astonishment 1
The 1
gentle 1
and 1
domestic 1
manners 1
it 1
described 1
combined 1
with 1
lofty 1
sentiments 1
and 1
feelings 1
which 1
had 1
for 1
their 1
object 1
something 1
out 1
of 1
self 1
accorded 1
well 1
with 1
my 1
experience 1
among 1
my 1
protectors 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
wants 1
which 1
were 1
forever 1
alive 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
bosom 1
But 1
I 1
thought 1
Werter 1
himself 1
a 1
more 1
divine 1
being 1
than 1
I 1
had 1
ever 1
beheld 1
or 1
imagined 1
his 1
character 1
contained 1
no 1
pretension 1
but 1
it 1
sank 1
deep 1
The 1
disquisitions 1
upon 1
death 1
and 1
suicide 1
were 1
calculated 1
to 1
fill 1
me 1
with 1
wonder 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
pretend 1
to 1
enter 1
into 1
the 1
merits 1
of 1
the 1
case 1
yet 1
I 1
inclined 1
towards 1
the 1
opinions 1
of 1
the 1
hero 1
whose 1
extinction 1
I 1
wept 1
without 1
precisely 1
understanding 1
it 1
As 1
I 1
read 1
however 1
I 1
applied 1
much 1
personally 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
feelings 1
and 1
condition 1
I 1
found 1
myself 1
similar 1
yet 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
strangely 1
unlike 1
to 1
the 1
beings 1
concerning 1
whom 1
I 1
read 1
and 1
to 1
whose 1
conversation 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
listener 1
I 1
sympathized 1
with 1
and 1
partly 1
understood 1
them 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
unformed 1
in 1
mind 1
I 1
was 1
dependent 1
on 1
none 1
and 1
related 1
to 1
none 1
The 1
path 1
of 1
my 1
departure 1
was 1
free 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
none 1
to 1
lament 1
my 1
annihilation 1
My 1
person 1
was 1
hideous 1
and 1
my 1
stature 1
gigantic 1
What 1
did 1
this 1
mean 1
Who 1
was 1
I 1
What 1
was 1
I 1
Whence 1
did 1
I 1
come 1
What 1
was 1
my 1
destination 1
These 1
questions 1
continually 1
recurred 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
solve 1
them 1
The 1
volume 1
of 1
Plutarch 1
s 1
Lives 1
which 1
I 1
possessed 1
contained 1
the 1
histories 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
founders 1
of 1
the 1
ancient 1
republics 1
This 1
book 1
had 1
a 1
far 1
different 1
effect 1
upon 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
Sorrows 1
of 1
Werter 1
I 1
learned 1
from 1
Werter 1
s 1
imaginations 1
despondency 1
and 1
gloom 1
but 1
Plutarch 1
taught 1
me 1
high 1
thoughts 1
he 1
elevated 1
me 1
above 1
the 1
wretched 1
sphere 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
reflections 1
to 1
admire 1
and 1
love 1
the 1
heroes 1
of 1
past 1
ages 1
Many 1
things 1
I 1
read 1
surpassed 1
my 1
understanding 1
and 1
experience 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
very 1
confused 1
knowledge 1
of 1
kingdoms 1
wide 1
extents 1
of 1
country 1
mighty 1
rivers 1
and 1
boundless 1
seas 1
But 1
I 1
was 1
perfectly 1
unacquainted 1
with 1
towns 1
and 1
large 1
assemblages 1
of 1
men 1
The 1
cottage 1
of 1
my 1
protectors 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
only 1
school 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
studied 1
human 1
nature 1
but 1
this 1
book 1
developed 1
new 1
and 1
mightier 1
scenes 1
of 1
action 1
I 1
read 1
of 1
men 1
concerned 1
in 1
public 1
affairs 1
governing 1
or 1
massacring 1
their 1
species 1
I 1
felt 1
the 1
greatest 1
ardour 1
for 1
virtue 1
rise 1
within 1
me 1
and 1
abhorrence 1
for 1
vice 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
I 1
understood 1
the 1
signification 1
of 1
those 1
terms 1
relative 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
as 1
I 1
applied 1
them 1
to 1
pleasure 1
and 1
pain 1
alone 1
Induced 1
by 1
these 1
feelings 1
I 1
was 1
of 1
course 1
led 1
to 1
admire 1
peaceable 1
lawgivers 1
Numa 1
Solon 1
and 1
Lycurgus 1
in 1
preference 1
to 1
Romulus 1
and 1
Theseus 1
The 1
patriarchal 1
lives 1
of 1
my 1
protectors 1
caused 1
these 1
impressions 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
firm 1
hold 1
on 1
my 1
mind 1
perhaps 1
if 1
my 1
first 1
introduction 1
to 1
humanity 1
had 1
been 1
made 1
by 1
a 1
young 1
soldier 1
burning 1
for 1
glory 1
and 1
slaughter 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
imbued 1
with 1
different 1
sensations 1
But 1
Paradise 1
Lost 1
excited 1
different 1
and 1
far 1
deeper 1
emotions 1
I 1
read 1
it 1
as 1
I 1
had 1
read 1
the 1
other 1
volumes 1
which 1
had 1
fallen 1
into 1
my 1
hands 1
as 1
a 1
true 1
history 1
It 1
moved 1
every 1
feeling 1
of 1
wonder 1
and 1
awe 1
that 1
the 1
picture 1
of 1
an 1
omnipotent 1
God 1
warring 1
with 1
his 1
creatures 1
was 1
capable 1
of 1
exciting 1
I 1
often 1
referred 1
the 1
several 1
situations 1
as 1
their 1
similarity 1
struck 1
me 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
Like 1
Adam 1
I 1
was 1
apparently 1
united 1
by 1
no 1
link 1
to 1
any 1
other 1
being 1
in 1
existence 1
but 1
his 1
state 1
was 1
far 1
different 1
from 1
mine 1
in 1
every 1
other 1
respect 1
He 1
had 1
come 1
forth 1
from 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
God 1
a 1
perfect 1
creature 1
happy 1
and 1
prosperous 1
guarded 1
by 1
the 1
especial 1
care 1
of 1
his 1
Creator 1
he 1
was 1
allowed 1
to 1
converse 1
with 1
and 1
acquire 1
knowledge 1
from 1
beings 1
of 1
a 1
superior 1
nature 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
wretched 1
helpless 1
and 1
alone 1
Many 1
times 1
I 1
considered 1
Satan 1
as 1
the 1
fitter 1
emblem 1
of 1
my 1
condition 1
for 1
often 1
like 1
him 1
when 1
I 1
viewed 1
the 1
bliss 1
of 1
my 1
protectors 1
the 1
bitter 1
gall 1
of 1
envy 1
rose 1
within 1
me 1
Another 1
circumstance 1
strengthened 1
and 1
confirmed 1
these 1
feelings 1
Soon 1
after 1
my 1
arrival 1
in 1
the 1
hovel 1
I 1
discovered 1
some 1
papers 1
in 1
the 1
pocket 1
of 1
the 1
dress 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
taken 1
from 1
your 1
laboratory 1
At 1
first 1
I 1
had 1
neglected 1
them 1
but 1
now 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
decipher 1
the 1
characters 1
in 1
which 1
they 1
were 1
written 1
I 1
began 1
to 1
study 1
them 1
with 1
diligence 1
It 1
was 1
your 1
journal 1
of 1
the 1
four 1
months 1
that 1
preceded 1
my 1
creation 1
You 1
minutely 1
described 1
in 1
these 1
papers 1
every 1
step 1
you 1
took 1
in 1
the 1
progress 1
of 1
your 1
work 1
this 1
history 1
was 1
mingled 1
with 1
accounts 1
of 1
domestic 1
occurrences 1
You 1
doubtless 1
recollect 1
these 1
papers 1
Here 1
they 1
are 1
Everything 1
is 1
related 1
in 1
them 1
which 1
bears 1
reference 1
to 1
my 1
accursed 1
origin 1
the 1
whole 1
detail 1
of 1
that 1
series 1
of 1
disgusting 1
circumstances 1
which 1
produced 1
it 1
is 1
set 1
in 1
view 1
the 1
minutest 1
description 1
of 1
my 1
odious 1
and 1
loathsome 1
person 1
is 1
given 1
in 1
language 1
which 1
painted 1
your 1
own 1
horrors 1
and 1
rendered 1
mine 1
indelible 1
I 1
sickened 1
as 1
I 1
read 1
Hateful 1
day 1
when 1
I 1
received 1
life 1
I 1
exclaimed 1
in 1
agony 1
Accursed 1
creator 1
Why 1
did 1
you 1
form 1
a 1
monster 1
so 1
hideous 1
that 1
even 1
YOU 1
turned 1
from 1
me 1
in 1
disgust 1
God 1
in 1
pity 1
made 1
man 1
beautiful 1
and 1
alluring 1
after 1
his 1
own 1
image 1
but 1
my 1
form 1
is 1
a 1
filthy 1
type 1
of 1
yours 1
more 1
horrid 1
even 1
from 1
the 1
very 1
resemblance 1
Satan 1
had 1
his 1
companions 1
fellow 1
devils 1
to 1
admire 1
and 1
encourage 1
him 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
solitary 1
and 1
abhorred 1
These 1
were 1
the 1
reflections 1
of 1
my 1
hours 1
of 1
despondency 1
and 1
solitude 1
but 1
when 1
I 1
contemplated 1
the 1
virtues 1
of 1
the 1
cottagers 1
their 1
amiable 1
and 1
benevolent 1
dispositions 1
I 1
persuaded 1
myself 1
that 1
when 1
they 1
should 1
become 1
acquainted 1
with 1
my 1
admiration 1
of 1
their 1
virtues 1
they 1
would 1
compassionate 1
me 1
and 1
overlook 1
my 1
personal 1
deformity 1
Could 1
they 1
turn 1
from 1
their 1
door 1
one 1
however 1
monstrous 1
who 1
solicited 1
their 1
compassion 1
and 1
friendship 1
I 1
resolved 1
at 1
least 1
not 1
to 1
despair 1
but 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
to 1
fit 1
myself 1
for 1
an 1
interview 1
with 1
them 1
which 1
would 1
decide 1
my 1
fate 1
I 1
postponed 1
this 1
attempt 1
for 1
some 1
months 1
longer 1
for 1
the 1
importance 1
attached 1
to 1
its 1
success 1
inspired 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
dread 1
lest 1
I 1
should 1
fail 1
Besides 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
my 1
understanding 1
improved 1
so 1
much 1
with 1
every 1
day 1
s 1
experience 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
unwilling 1
to 1
commence 1
this 1
undertaking 1
until 1
a 1
few 1
more 1
months 1
should 1
have 1
added 1
to 1
my 1
sagacity 1
Several 1
changes 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
took 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
cottage 1
The 1
presence 1
of 1
Safie 1
diffused 1
happiness 1
among 1
its 1
inhabitants 1
and 1
I 1
also 1
found 1
that 1
a 1
greater 1
degree 1
of 1
plenty 1
reigned 1
there 1
Felix 1
and 1
Agatha 1
spent 1
more 1
time 1
in 1
amusement 1
and 1
conversation 1
and 1
were 1
assisted 1
in 1
their 1
labours 1
by 1
servants 1
They 1
did 1
not 1
appear 1
rich 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
contented 1
and 1
happy 1
their 1
feelings 1
were 1
serene 1
and 1
peaceful 1
while 1
mine 1
became 1
every 1
day 1
more 1
tumultuous 1
Increase 1
of 1
knowledge 1
only 1
discovered 1
to 1
me 1
more 1
clearly 1
what 1
a 1
wretched 1
outcast 1
I 1
was 1
I 1
cherished 1
hope 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
but 1
it 1
vanished 1
when 1
I 1
beheld 1
my 1
person 1
reflected 1
in 1
water 1
or 1
my 1
shadow 1
in 1
the 1
moonshine 1
even 1
as 1
that 1
frail 1
image 1
and 1
that 1
inconstant 1
shade 1
I 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
crush 1
these 1
fears 1
and 1
to 1
fortify 1
myself 1
for 1
the 1
trial 1
which 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
months 1
I 1
resolved 1
to 1
undergo 1
and 1
sometimes 1
I 1
allowed 1
my 1
thoughts 1
unchecked 1
by 1
reason 1
to 1
ramble 1
in 1
the 1
fields 1
of 1
Paradise 1
and 1
dared 1
to 1
fancy 1
amiable 1
and 1
lovely 1
creatures 1
sympathizing 1
with 1
my 1
feelings 1
and 1
cheering 1
my 1
gloom 1
their 1
angelic 1
countenances 1
breathed 1
smiles 1
of 1
consolation 1
But 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
a 1
dream 1
no 1
Eve 1
soothed 1
my 1
sorrows 1
nor 1
shared 1
my 1
thoughts 1
I 1
was 1
alone 1
I 1
remembered 1
Adam 1
s 1
supplication 1
to 1
his 1
Creator 1
But 1
where 1
was 1
mine 1
He 1
had 1
abandoned 1
me 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
bitterness 1
of 1
my 1
heart 1
I 1
cursed 1
him 1
Autumn 1
passed 1
thus 1
I 1
saw 1
with 1
surprise 1
and 1
grief 1
the 1
leaves 1
decay 1
and 1
fall 1
and 1
nature 1
again 1
assume 1
the 1
barren 1
and 1
bleak 1
appearance 1
it 1
had 1
worn 1
when 1
I 1
first 1
beheld 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
the 1
lovely 1
moon 1
Yet 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
heed 1
the 1
bleakness 1
of 1
the 1
weather 1
I 1
was 1
better 1
fitted 1
by 1
my 1
conformation 1
for 1
the 1
endurance 1
of 1
cold 1
than 1
heat 1
But 1
my 1
chief 1
delights 1
were 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
flowers 1
the 1
birds 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
gay 1
apparel 1
of 1
summer 1
when 1
those 1
deserted 1
me 1
I 1
turned 1
with 1
more 1
attention 1
towards 1
the 1
cottagers 1
Their 1
happiness 1
was 1
not 1
decreased 1
by 1
the 1
absence 1
of 1
summer 1
They 1
loved 1
and 1
sympathized 1
with 1
one 1
another 1
and 1
their 1
joys 1
depending 1
on 1
each 1
other 1
were 1
not 1
interrupted 1
by 1
the 1
casualties 1
that 1
took 1
place 1
around 1
them 1
The 1
more 1
I 1
saw 1
of 1
them 1
the 1
greater 1
became 1
my 1
desire 1
to 1
claim 1
their 1
protection 1
and 1
kindness 1
my 1
heart 1
yearned 1
to 1
be 1
known 1
and 1
loved 1
by 1
these 1
amiable 1
creatures 1
to 1
see 1
their 1
sweet 1
looks 1
directed 1
towards 1
me 1
with 1
affection 1
was 1
the 1
utmost 1
limit 1
of 1
my 1
ambition 1
I 1
dared 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
turn 1
them 1
from 1
me 1
with 1
disdain 1
and 1
horror 1
The 1
poor 1
that 1
stopped 1
at 1
their 1
door 1
were 1
never 1
driven 1
away 1
I 1
asked 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
for 1
greater 1
treasures 1
than 1
a 1
little 1
food 1
or 1
rest 1
I 1
required 1
kindness 1
and 1
sympathy 1
but 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
believe 1
myself 1
utterly 1
unworthy 1
of 1
it 1
The 1
winter 1
advanced 1
and 1
an 1
entire 1
revolution 1
of 1
the 1
seasons 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
since 1
I 1
awoke 1
into 1
life 1
My 1
attention 1
at 1
this 1
time 1
was 1
solely 1
directed 1
towards 1
my 1
plan 1
of 1
introducing 1
myself 1
into 1
the 1
cottage 1
of 1
my 1
protectors 1
I 1
revolved 1
many 1
projects 1
but 1
that 1
on 1
which 1
I 1
finally 1
fixed 1
was 1
to 1
enter 1
the 1
dwelling 1
when 1
the 1
blind 1
old 1
man 1
should 1
be 1
alone 1
I 1
had 1
sagacity 1
enough 1
to 1
discover 1
that 1
the 1
unnatural 1
hideousness 1
of 1
my 1
person 1
was 1
the 1
chief 1
object 1
of 1
horror 1
with 1
those 1
who 1
had 1
formerly 1
beheld 1
me 1
My 1
voice 1
although 1
harsh 1
had 1
nothing 1
terrible 1
in 1
it 1
I 1
thought 1
therefore 1
that 1
if 1
in 1
the 1
absence 1
of 1
his 1
children 1
I 1
could 1
gain 1
the 1
good 1
will 1
and 1
mediation 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
De 1
Lacey 1
I 1
might 1
by 1
his 1
means 1
be 1
tolerated 1
by 1
my 1
younger 1
protectors 1
One 1
day 1
when 1
the 1
sun 1
shone 1
on 1
the 1
red 1
leaves 1
that 1
strewed 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
diffused 1
cheerfulness 1
although 1
it 1
denied 1
warmth 1
Safie 1
Agatha 1
and 1
Felix 1
departed 1
on 1
a 1
long 1
country 1
walk 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
at 1
his 1
own 1
desire 1
was 1
left 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
cottage 1
When 1
his 1
children 1
had 1
departed 1
he 1
took 1
up 1
his 1
guitar 1
and 1
played 1
several 1
mournful 1
but 1
sweet 1
airs 1
more 1
sweet 1
and 1
mournful 1
than 1
I 1
had 1
ever 1
heard 1
him 1
play 1
before 1
At 1
first 1
his 1
countenance 1
was 1
illuminated 1
with 1
pleasure 1
but 1
as 1
he 1
continued 1
thoughtfulness 1
and 1
sadness 1
succeeded 1
at 1
length 1
laying 1
aside 1
the 1
instrument 1
he 1
sat 1
absorbed 1
in 1
reflection 1
My 1
heart 1
beat 1
quick 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
hour 1
and 1
moment 1
of 1
trial 1
which 1
would 1
decide 1
my 1
hopes 1
or 1
realize 1
my 1
fears 1
The 1
servants 1
were 1
gone 1
to 1
a 1
neighbouring 1
fair 1
All 1
was 1
silent 1
in 1
and 1
around 1
the 1
cottage 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
excellent 1
opportunity 1
yet 1
when 1
I 1
proceeded 1
to 1
execute 1
my 1
plan 1
my 1
limbs 1
failed 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
sank 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
Again 1
I 1
rose 1
and 1
exerting 1
all 1
the 1
firmness 1
of 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
master 1
removed 1
the 1
planks 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
placed 1
before 1
my 1
hovel 1
to 1
conceal 1
my 1
retreat 1
The 1
fresh 1
air 1
revived 1
me 1
and 1
with 1
renewed 1
determination 1
I 1
approached 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
their 1
cottage 1
I 1
knocked 1
Who 1
is 1
there 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
Come 1
in 1
I 1
entered 1
Pardon 1
this 1
intrusion 1
said 1
I 2
am 1
a 1
traveller 1
in 1
want 1
of 1
a 1
little 1
rest 1
you 1
would 1
greatly 1
oblige 1
me 1
if 1
you 1
would 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
remain 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
before 1
the 1
fire 1
Enter 1
said 1
De 1
Lacey 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
try 1
in 1
what 1
manner 1
I 1
can 1
to 1
relieve 1
your 1
wants 1
but 1
unfortunately 1
my 1
children 1
are 1
from 1
home 1
and 1
as 1
I 1
am 1
blind 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
I 1
shall 1
find 1
it 1
difficult 1
to 1
procure 1
food 1
for 1
you 1
Do 1
not 1
trouble 1
yourself 1
my 1
kind 1
host 1
I 1
have 1
food 1
it 1
is 1
warmth 1
and 1
rest 1
only 1
that 1
I 1
need 1
I 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
a 1
silence 1
ensued 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
every 1
minute 1
was 1
precious 1
to 1
me 1
yet 1
I 1
remained 1
irresolute 1
in 1
what 1
manner 1
to 1
commence 1
the 1
interview 1
when 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
addressed 1
me 1
By 1
your 1
language 1
stranger 1
I 1
suppose 1
you 1
are 1
my 1
countryman 1
are 1
you 1
French 1
No 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
educated 1
by 1
a 1
French 1
family 1
and 1
understand 1
that 1
language 1
only 1
I 1
am 1
now 1
going 1
to 1
claim 1
the 1
protection 1
of 1
some 1
friends 1
whom 1
I 1
sincerely 1
love 1
and 1
of 1
whose 1
favour 1
I 1
have 1
some 1
hopes 1
Are 1
they 1
Germans 1
No 1
they 1
are 1
French 1
But 1
let 1
us 1
change 1
the 1
subject 1
I 1
am 1
an 1
unfortunate 1
and 1
deserted 1
creature 1
I 1
look 1
around 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
relation 1
or 1
friend 1
upon 1
earth 1
These 1
amiable 1
people 1
to 1
whom 1
I 1
go 1
have 1
never 1
seen 1
me 1
and 1
know 1
little 1
of 1
me 1
I 1
am 1
full 1
of 1
fears 1
for 1
if 1
I 1
fail 1
there 1
I 1
am 1
an 1
outcast 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
forever 1
Do 1
not 1
despair 1
To 1
be 1
friendless 1
is 1
indeed 1
to 1
be 1
unfortunate 1
but 1
the 1
hearts 1
of 1
men 1
when 1
unprejudiced 1
by 1
any 1
obvious 1
self 1
interest 1
are 1
full 1
of 1
brotherly 1
love 1
and 1
charity 1
Rely 1
therefore 1
on 1
your 1
hopes 1
and 1
if 1
these 1
friends 1
are 1
good 1
and 1
amiable 1
do 1
not 1
despair 1
They 1
are 1
kind 1
they 1
are 1
the 1
most 1
excellent 1
creatures 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
but 1
unfortunately 1
they 1
are 1
prejudiced 1
against 1
me 1
I 1
have 1
good 1
dispositions 1
my 1
life 1
has 1
been 1
hitherto 1
harmless 1
and 1
in 1
some 1
degree 1
beneficial 1
but 1
a 1
fatal 1
prejudice 1
clouds 1
their 1
eyes 1
and 1
where 1
they 1
ought 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
feeling 1
and 1
kind 1
friend 1
they 1
behold 1
only 1
a 1
detestable 1
monster 1
That 1
is 1
indeed 1
unfortunate 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
really 1
blameless 1
cannot 1
you 1
undeceive 1
them 1
I 1
am 1
about 1
to 1
undertake 1
that 1
task 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
on 1
that 1
account 1
that 1
I 1
feel 1
so 1
many 1
overwhelming 1
terrors 1
I 1
tenderly 1
love 1
these 1
friends 1
I 1
have 1
unknown 1
to 1
them 1
been 1
for 1
many 1
months 1
in 1
the 1
habits 1
of 1
daily 1
kindness 1
towards 1
them 1
but 1
they 1
believe 1
that 1
I 1
wish 1
to 1
injure 1
them 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
prejudice 1
which 1
I 1
wish 1
to 1
overcome 1
Where 1
do 1
these 1
friends 1
reside 1
Near 1
this 1
spot 1
The 1
old 1
man 1
paused 1
and 1
then 1
continued 1
If 1
you 1
will 1
unreservedly 1
confide 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
particulars 1
of 1
your 1
tale 1
I 1
perhaps 1
may 1
be 1
of 1
use 1
in 1
undeceiving 1
them 1
I 1
am 1
blind 1
and 1
cannot 1
judge 1
of 1
your 1
countenance 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
something 1
in 1
your 1
words 1
which 1
persuades 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
sincere 1
I 1
am 1
poor 1
and 1
an 1
exile 1
but 1
it 1
will 1
afford 1
me 1
true 1
pleasure 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
any 1
way 1
serviceable 1
to 1
a 1
human 1
creature 1
Excellent 1
man 1
I 1
thank 1
you 1
and 1
accept 1
your 1
generous 1
offer 1
You 1
raise 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
dust 1
by 1
this 1
kindness 1
and 1
I 1
trust 1
that 1
by 1
your 1
aid 1
I 1
shall 1
not 1
be 1
driven 1
from 1
the 1
society 1
and 1
sympathy 1
of 1
your 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
Heaven 1
forbid 1
Even 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
really 1
criminal 1
for 1
that 1
can 1
only 1
drive 1
you 1
to 1
desperation 1
and 1
not 1
instigate 1
you 1
to 1
virtue 1
I 1
also 1
am 1
unfortunate 1
I 1
and 1
my 1
family 1
have 1
been 1
condemned 1
although 1
innocent 1
judge 1
therefore 1
if 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
feel 1
for 1
your 1
misfortunes 1
How 1
can 1
I 1
thank 1
you 1
my 1
best 1
and 1
only 1
benefactor 1
From 1
your 1
lips 1
first 1
have 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
kindness 1
directed 1
towards 1
me 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
forever 1
grateful 1
and 1
your 1
present 1
humanity 1
assures 1
me 1
of 1
success 1
with 1
those 1
friends 1
whom 1
I 1
am 1
on 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
meeting 1
May 1
I 1
know 1
the 1
names 1
and 1
residence 1
of 1
those 1
friends 1
I 1
paused 1
This 1
I 1
thought 1
was 1
the 1
moment 1
of 1
decision 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
rob 1
me 1
of 1
or 1
bestow 1
happiness 1
on 1
me 1
forever 1
I 1
struggled 1
vainly 1
for 1
firmness 1
sufficient 1
to 1
answer 1
him 1
but 1
the 1
effort 1
destroyed 1
all 1
my 1
remaining 1
strength 1
I 1
sank 1
on 1
the 1
chair 1
and 1
sobbed 1
aloud 1
At 1
that 1
moment 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
steps 1
of 1
my 1
younger 1
protectors 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
a 1
moment 1
to 1
lose 1
but 1
seizing 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
I 1
cried 1
Now 1
is 1
the 1
time 1
Save 1
and 1
protect 1
me 1
You 1
and 1
your 1
family 1
are 1
the 1
friends 1
whom 1
I 1
seek 1
Do 1
not 1
you 1
desert 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
hour 1
of 1
trial 1
Great 1
God 1
exclaimed 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
Who 1
are 1
you 1
At 1
that 1
instant 1
the 1
cottage 1
door 1
was 1
opened 1
and 1
Felix 1
Safie 1
and 1
Agatha 1
entered 1
Who 1
can 1
describe 1
their 1
horror 1
and 1
consternation 1
on 1
beholding 1
me 1
Agatha 1
fainted 1
and 1
Safie 1
unable 1
to 1
attend 1
to 1
her 1
friend 1
rushed 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
cottage 1
Felix 1
darted 1
forward 1
and 1
with 1
supernatural 1
force 1
tore 1
me 1
from 1
his 1
father 1
to 1
whose 1
knees 1
I 1
clung 1
in 1
a 1
transport 1
of 1
fury 1
he 1
dashed 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
struck 1
me 1
violently 1
with 1
a 1
stick 1
I 1
could 1
have 1
torn 1
him 1
limb 1
from 1
limb 1
as 1
the 1
lion 1
rends 1
the 1
antelope 1
But 1
my 1
heart 1
sank 1
within 1
me 1
as 1
with 1
bitter 1
sickness 1
and 1
I 1
refrained 1
I 1
saw 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
repeating 1
his 1
blow 1
when 1
overcome 1
by 1
pain 1
and 1
anguish 1
I 1
quitted 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
general 1
tumult 1
escaped 1
unperceived 1
to 1
my 1
hovel 1
Chapter 1
Cursed 1
cursed 1
creator 1
Why 1
did 1
I 1
live 1
Why 1
in 1
that 1
instant 1
did 1
I 1
not 1
extinguish 1
the 1
spark 1
of 1
existence 1
which 1
you 1
had 1
so 1
wantonly 1
bestowed 1
I 1
know 1
not 1
despair 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
taken 1
possession 1
of 1
me 1
my 1
feelings 1
were 1
those 1
of 1
rage 1
and 1
revenge 1
I 1
could 1
with 1
pleasure 1
have 1
destroyed 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
its 1
inhabitants 1
and 1
have 1
glutted 1
myself 1
with 1
their 1
shrieks 1
and 1
misery 1
When 1
night 1
came 1
I 1
quitted 1
my 1
retreat 1
and 1
wandered 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
and 1
now 1
no 1
longer 1
restrained 1
by 1
the 1
fear 1
of 1
discovery 1
I 1
gave 1
vent 1
to 1
my 1
anguish 1
in 1
fearful 1
howlings 1
I 1
was 1
like 1
a 1
wild 1
beast 1
that 1
had 1
broken 1
the 1
toils 1
destroying 1
the 1
objects 1
that 1
obstructed 1
me 1
and 1
ranging 1
through 1
the 1
wood 1
with 1
a 1
stag 1
like 1
swiftness 1
Oh 1
What 1
a 1
miserable 1
night 1
I 1
passed 1
The 1
cold 1
stars 1
shone 1
in 1
mockery 1
and 1
the 1
bare 1
trees 1
waved 1
their 1
branches 1
above 1
me 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
sweet 1
voice 1
of 1
a 1
bird 1
burst 1
forth 1
amidst 1
the 1
universal 1
stillness 1
All 1
save 1
I 1
were 1
at 1
rest 1
or 1
in 1
enjoyment 1
I 1
like 1
the 1
arch 1
fiend 1
bore 1
a 1
hell 1
within 1
me 1
and 1
finding 1
myself 1
unsympathized 1
with 1
wished 1
to 1
tear 1
up 1
the 1
trees 1
spread 1
havoc 1
and 1
destruction 1
around 1
me 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
have 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
enjoyed 1
the 1
ruin 1
But 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
luxury 1
of 1
sensation 1
that 1
could 1
not 1
endure 1
I 1
became 1
fatigued 1
with 1
excess 1
of 1
bodily 1
exertion 1
and 1
sank 1
on 1
the 1
damp 1
grass 1
in 1
the 1
sick 1
impotence 1
of 1
despair 1
There 1
was 1
none 1
among 1
the 1
myriads 1
of 1
men 1
that 1
existed 1
who 1
would 1
pity 1
or 1
assist 1
me 1
and 1
should 1
I 1
feel 1
kindness 1
towards 1
my 1
enemies 1
No 1
from 1
that 1
moment 1
I 1
declared 1
everlasting 1
war 1
against 1
the 1
species 1
and 1
more 1
than 1
all 1
against 1
him 1
who 1
had 1
formed 1
me 1
and 1
sent 1
me 1
forth 1
to 1
this 1
insupportable 1
misery 1
The 1
sun 1
rose 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
voices 1
of 1
men 1
and 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
my 1
retreat 1
during 1
that 1
day 1
Accordingly 1
I 1
hid 1
myself 1
in 1
some 1
thick 1
underwood 1
determining 1
to 1
devote 1
the 1
ensuing 1
hours 1
to 1
reflection 1
on 1
my 1
situation 1
The 1
pleasant 1
sunshine 1
and 1
the 1
pure 1
air 1
of 1
day 1
restored 1
me 1
to 1
some 1
degree 1
of 1
tranquillity 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
considered 1
what 1
had 1
passed 1
at 1
the 1
cottage 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
believing 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
too 1
hasty 1
in 1
my 1
conclusions 1
I 1
had 1
certainly 1
acted 1
imprudently 1
It 1
was 1
apparent 1
that 1
my 1
conversation 1
had 1
interested 1
the 1
father 1
in 1
my 1
behalf 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
fool 1
in 1
having 1
exposed 1
my 1
person 1
to 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
his 1
children 1
I 1
ought 1
to 1
have 1
familiarized 1
the 1
old 1
De 1
Lacey 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
by 1
degrees 1
to 1
have 1
discovered 1
myself 1
to 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
his 1
family 1
when 1
they 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
prepared 1
for 1
my 1
approach 1
But 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
believe 1
my 1
errors 1
to 1
be 1
irretrievable 1
and 1
after 1
much 1
consideration 1
I 1
resolved 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
cottage 1
seek 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
and 1
by 1
my 1
representations 1
win 1
him 1
to 1
my 1
party 1
These 1
thoughts 1
calmed 1
me 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
I 1
sank 1
into 1
a 1
profound 1
sleep 1
but 1
the 1
fever 1
of 1
my 1
blood 1
did 1
not 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
visited 1
by 1
peaceful 1
dreams 1
The 1
horrible 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
preceding 1
day 1
was 1
forever 1
acting 1
before 1
my 1
eyes 1
the 1
females 1
were 1
flying 1
and 1
the 1
enraged 1
Felix 1
tearing 1
me 1
from 1
his 1
father 1
s 1
feet 1
I 1
awoke 1
exhausted 1
and 1
finding 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
already 1
night 1
I 1
crept 1
forth 1
from 1
my 1
hiding 1
place 1
and 1
went 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
food 1
When 1
my 1
hunger 1
was 1
appeased 1
I 1
directed 1
my 1
steps 1
towards 1
the 1
well 1
known 1
path 1
that 1
conducted 1
to 1
the 1
cottage 1
All 1
there 1
was 1
at 1
peace 1
I 1
crept 1
into 1
my 1
hovel 1
and 1
remained 1
in 1
silent 1
expectation 1
of 1
the 1
accustomed 1
hour 1
when 1
the 1
family 1
arose 1
That 1
hour 1
passed 1
the 1
sun 1
mounted 1
high 1
in 1
the 1
heavens 1
but 1
the 1
cottagers 1
did 1
not 1
appear 1
I 1
trembled 1
violently 1
apprehending 1
some 1
dreadful 1
misfortune 1
The 1
inside 1
of 1
the 1
cottage 1
was 1
dark 1
and 1
I 1
heard 1
no 1
motion 1
I 1
cannot 1
describe 1
the 1
agony 1
of 1
this 1
suspense 1
Presently 1
two 1
countrymen 1
passed 1
by 1
but 1
pausing 1
near 1
the 1
cottage 1
they 1
entered 1
into 1
conversation 1
using 1
violent 1
gesticulations 1
but 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
understand 1
what 1
they 1
said 1
as 1
they 1
spoke 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
which 1
differed 1
from 1
that 1
of 1
my 1
protectors 1
Soon 1
after 1
however 1
Felix 1
approached 1
with 1
another 1
man 1
I 1
was 1
surprised 1
as 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
quitted 1
the 1
cottage 1
that 1
morning 1
and 1
waited 1
anxiously 1
to 1
discover 1
from 1
his 1
discourse 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
these 1
unusual 1
appearances 1
Do 1
you 1
consider 1
said 1
his 1
companion 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
obliged 1
to 1
pay 1
three 1
months 1
rent 1
and 1
to 1
lose 1
the 1
produce 1
of 1
your 1
garden 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
take 1
any 1
unfair 1
advantage 1
and 1
I 1
beg 1
therefore 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
take 1
some 1
days 1
to 1
consider 1
of 1
your 1
determination 1
It 1
is 1
utterly 1
useless 1
replied 1
Felix 1
we 1
can 1
never 1
again 1
inhabit 1
your 1
cottage 1
The 1
life 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
greatest 1
danger 1
owing 1
to 1
the 1
dreadful 1
circumstance 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
related 1
My 1
wife 1
and 1
my 1
sister 1
will 1
never 1
recover 1
from 1
their 1
horror 1
I 1
entreat 1
you 1
not 1
to 1
reason 1
with 1
me 1
any 1
more 1
Take 1
possession 1
of 1
your 1
tenement 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
fly 1
from 1
this 1
place 1
Felix 1
trembled 1
violently 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
this 1
He 1
and 1
his 1
companion 1
entered 1
the 1
cottage 1
in 1
which 1
they 1
remained 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
and 1
then 1
departed 1
I 1
never 1
saw 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
of 1
De 1
Lacey 1
more 1
I 1
continued 1
for 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
in 1
my 1
hovel 1
in 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
utter 1
and 1
stupid 1
despair 1
My 1
protectors 1
had 1
departed 1
and 1
had 1
broken 1
the 1
only 1
link 1
that 1
held 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
world 1
For 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
revenge 1
and 1
hatred 1
filled 1
my 1
bosom 1
and 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
strive 1
to 1
control 1
them 1
but 1
allowing 1
myself 1
to 1
be 1
borne 1
away 1
by 1
the 1
stream 1
I 1
bent 1
my 1
mind 1
towards 1
injury 1
and 1
death 1
When 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
of 1
the 1
mild 1
voice 1
of 1
De 1
Lacey 1
the 1
gentle 1
eyes 1
of 1
Agatha 1
and 1
the 1
exquisite 1
beauty 1
of 1
the 1
Arabian 1
these 1
thoughts 1
vanished 1
and 1
a 1
gush 1
of 1
tears 1
somewhat 1
soothed 1
me 1
But 1
again 1
when 1
I 1
reflected 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
spurned 1
and 1
deserted 1
me 1
anger 1
returned 1
a 1
rage 1
of 1
anger 1
and 1
unable 1
to 1
injure 1
anything 1
human 1
I 1
turned 1
my 1
fury 1
towards 1
inanimate 1
objects 1
As 1
night 1
advanced 1
I 1
placed 1
a 1
variety 1
of 1
combustibles 1
around 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
after 1
having 1
destroyed 1
every 1
vestige 1
of 1
cultivation 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
I 1
waited 1
with 1
forced 1
impatience 1
until 1
the 1
moon 1
had 1
sunk 1
to 1
commence 1
my 1
operations 1
As 1
the 1
night 1
advanced 1
a 1
fierce 1
wind 1
arose 1
from 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
quickly 1
dispersed 1
the 1
clouds 1
that 1
had 1
loitered 1
in 1
the 1
heavens 1
the 1
blast 1
tore 1
along 1
like 1
a 1
mighty 1
avalanche 1
and 1
produced 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
insanity 1
in 1
my 1
spirits 1
that 1
burst 1
all 1
bounds 1
of 1
reason 1
and 1
reflection 1
I 1
lighted 1
the 1
dry 1
branch 1
of 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
danced 1
with 1
fury 1
around 1
the 1
devoted 1
cottage 1
my 1
eyes 1
still 1
fixed 1
on 1
the 1
western 1
horizon 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
which 1
the 1
moon 1
nearly 1
touched 1
A 1
part 1
of 1
its 1
orb 1
was 1
at 1
length 1
hid 1
and 1
I 1
waved 1
my 1
brand 1
it 1
sank 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
loud 1
scream 1
I 1
fired 1
the 1
straw 1
and 1
heath 1
and 1
bushes 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
collected 1
The 1
wind 1
fanned 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
the 1
cottage 1
was 1
quickly 1
enveloped 1
by 1
the 1
flames 1
which 1
clung 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
licked 1
it 1
with 1
their 1
forked 1
and 1
destroying 1
tongues 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
convinced 1
that 1
no 1
assistance 1
could 1
save 1
any 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
habitation 1
I 1
quitted 1
the 1
scene 1
and 1
sought 1
for 1
refuge 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
And 1
now 1
with 1
the 1
world 1
before 1
me 1
whither 1
should 1
I 1
bend 1
my 1
steps 1
I 1
resolved 1
to 1
fly 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
my 1
misfortunes 1
but 1
to 1
me 1
hated 1
and 1
despised 1
every 1
country 1
must 1
be 1
equally 1
horrible 1
At 1
length 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
you 1
crossed 1
my 1
mind 1
I 1
learned 1
from 1
your 1
papers 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
my 1
father 1
my 1
creator 1
and 1
to 1
whom 1
could 1
I 1
apply 1
with 1
more 1
fitness 1
than 1
to 1
him 1
who 1
had 1
given 1
me 1
life 1
Among 1
the 1
lessons 1
that 1
Felix 1
had 1
bestowed 1
upon 1
Safie 1
geography 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
omitted 1
I 1
had 1
learned 1
from 1
these 1
the 1
relative 1
situations 1
of 1
the 1
different 1
countries 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
You 1
had 1
mentioned 1
Geneva 1
as 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
your 1
native 1
town 1
and 1
towards 1
this 1
place 1
I 1
resolved 1
to 1
proceed 1
But 1
how 1
was 1
I 1
to 1
direct 1
myself 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
I 1
must 1
travel 1
in 1
a 1
southwesterly 1
direction 1
to 1
reach 1
my 1
destination 1
but 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
my 1
only 1
guide 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
the 1
towns 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
to 1
pass 1
through 1
nor 1
could 1
I 1
ask 1
information 1
from 1
a 1
single 1
human 1
being 1
but 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
despair 1
From 1
you 1
only 1
could 1
I 1
hope 1
for 1
succour 1
although 1
towards 1
you 1
I 1
felt 1
no 1
sentiment 1
but 1
that 1
of 1
hatred 1
Unfeeling 1
heartless 1
creator 1
You 1
had 1
endowed 1
me 1
with 1
perceptions 1
and 1
passions 1
and 1
then 1
cast 1
me 1
abroad 1
an 1
object 1
for 1
the 1
scorn 1
and 1
horror 1
of 1
mankind 1
But 1
on 1
you 1
only 1
had 1
I 1
any 1
claim 1
for 1
pity 1
and 1
redress 1
and 1
from 1
you 1
I 1
determined 1
to 1
seek 1
that 1
justice 1
which 1
I 1
vainly 1
attempted 1
to 1
gain 1
from 1
any 1
other 1
being 1
that 1
wore 1
the 1
human 1
form 1
My 1
travels 1
were 1
long 1
and 1
the 1
sufferings 1
I 1
endured 1
intense 1
It 1
was 1
late 1
in 1
autumn 1
when 1
I 1
quitted 1
the 1
district 1
where 1
I 1
had 1
so 1
long 1
resided 1
I 1
travelled 1
only 1
at 1
night 1
fearful 1
of 1
encountering 1
the 1
visage 1
of 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
Nature 1
decayed 1
around 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
became 1
heatless 1
rain 1
and 1
snow 1
poured 1
around 1
me 1
mighty 1
rivers 1
were 1
frozen 1
the 1
surface 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
was 1
hard 1
and 1
chill 1
and 1
bare 1
and 1
I 1
found 1
no 1
shelter 1
Oh 1
earth 1
How 1
often 1
did 1
I 1
imprecate 1
curses 1
on 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
my 1
being 1
The 1
mildness 1
of 1
my 1
nature 1
had 1
fled 1
and 1
all 1
within 1
me 1
was 1
turned 1
to 1
gall 1
and 1
bitterness 1
The 1
nearer 1
I 1
approached 1
to 1
your 1
habitation 1
the 1
more 1
deeply 1
did 1
I 1
feel 1
the 1
spirit 1
of 1
revenge 1
enkindled 1
in 1
my 1
heart 1
Snow 1
fell 1
and 1
the 1
waters 1
were 1
hardened 1
but 1
I 1
rested 1
not 1
A 1
few 1
incidents 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
directed 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
possessed 1
a 1
map 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
but 1
I 1
often 1
wandered 1
wide 1
from 1
my 1
path 1
The 1
agony 1
of 1
my 1
feelings 1
allowed 1
me 1
no 1
respite 1
no 1
incident 1
occurred 1
from 1
which 1
my 1
rage 1
and 1
misery 1
could 1
not 1
extract 1
its 1
food 1
but 1
a 1
circumstance 1
that 1
happened 1
when 1
I 1
arrived 1
on 1
the 1
confines 1
of 1
Switzerland 1
when 1
the 1
sun 1
had 1
recovered 1
its 1
warmth 1
and 1
the 1
earth 1
again 1
began 1
to 1
look 1
green 1
confirmed 1
in 1
an 1
especial 1
manner 1
the 1
bitterness 1
and 1
horror 1
of 1
my 1
feelings 1
I 1
generally 1
rested 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
travelled 1
only 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
secured 1
by 1
night 1
from 1
the 1
view 1
of 1
man 1
One 1
morning 1
however 1
finding 1
that 1
my 1
path 1
lay 1
through 1
a 1
deep 1
wood 1
I 1
ventured 1
to 1
continue 1
my 1
journey 1
after 1
the 1
sun 1
had 1
risen 1
the 1
day 1
which 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
of 1
spring 1
cheered 1
even 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
loveliness 1
of 1
its 1
sunshine 1
and 1
the 1
balminess 1
of 1
the 1
air 1
I 1
felt 1
emotions 1
of 1
gentleness 1
and 1
pleasure 1
that 1
had 1
long 1
appeared 1
dead 1
revive 1
within 1
me 1
Half 1
surprised 1
by 1
the 1
novelty 1
of 1
these 1
sensations 1
I 1
allowed 1
myself 1
to 1
be 1
borne 1
away 1
by 1
them 1
and 1
forgetting 1
my 1
solitude 1
and 1
deformity 1
dared 1
to 1
be 1
happy 1
Soft 1
tears 1
again 1
bedewed 1
my 1
cheeks 1
and 1
I 1
even 1
raised 1
my 1
humid 1
eyes 1
with 1
thankfulness 1
towards 1
the 1
blessed 1
sun 1
which 1
bestowed 1
such 1
joy 1
upon 1
me 1
I 1
continued 1
to 1
wind 1
among 1
the 1
paths 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
until 1
I 1
came 1
to 1
its 1
boundary 1
which 1
was 1
skirted 1
by 1
a 1
deep 1
and 1
rapid 1
river 1
into 1
which 1
many 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
bent 1
their 1
branches 1
now 1
budding 1
with 1
the 1
fresh 1
spring 1
Here 1
I 1
paused 1
not 1
exactly 1
knowing 1
what 1
path 1
to 1
pursue 1
when 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
voices 1
that 1
induced 1
me 1
to 1
conceal 1
myself 1
under 1
the 1
shade 1
of 1
a 1
cypress 1
I 1
was 1
scarcely 1
hid 1
when 1
a 1
young 1
girl 1
came 1
running 1
towards 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
I 1
was 1
concealed 1
laughing 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
ran 1
from 1
someone 1
in 1
sport 1
She 1
continued 1
her 1
course 1
along 1
the 1
precipitous 1
sides 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
when 1
suddenly 1
her 1
foot 1
slipped 1
and 1
she 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
rapid 1
stream 1
I 1
rushed 1
from 1
my 1
hiding 1
place 1
and 1
with 1
extreme 1
labour 1
from 1
the 1
force 1
of 1
the 1
current 1
saved 1
her 1
and 1
dragged 1
her 1
to 1
shore 1
She 1
was 1
senseless 1
and 1
I 1
endeavoured 1
by 1
every 1
means 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
to 1
restore 1
animation 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
suddenly 1
interrupted 1
by 1
the 1
approach 1
of 1
a 1
rustic 1
who 1
was 1
probably 1
the 1
person 1
from 1
whom 1
she 1
had 1
playfully 1
fled 1
On 1
seeing 1
me 1
he 1
darted 1
towards 1
me 1
and 1
tearing 1
the 1
girl 1
from 1
my 1
arms 1
hastened 1
towards 1
the 1
deeper 1
parts 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
I 1
followed 1
speedily 1
I 1
hardly 1
knew 1
why 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
man 1
saw 1
me 1
draw 1
near 1
he 1
aimed 1
a 1
gun 1
which 1
he 1
carried 1
at 1
my 1
body 1
and 1
fired 1
I 1
sank 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
my 1
injurer 1
with 1
increased 1
swiftness 1
escaped 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
This 1
was 1
then 1
the 1
reward 1
of 1
my 1
benevolence 1
I 1
had 1
saved 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
from 1
destruction 1
and 1
as 1
a 1
recompense 1
I 1
now 1
writhed 1
under 1
the 1
miserable 1
pain 1
of 1
a 1
wound 1
which 1
shattered 1
the 1
flesh 1
and 1
bone 1
The 1
feelings 1
of 1
kindness 1
and 1
gentleness 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
entertained 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
before 1
gave 1
place 1
to 1
hellish 1
rage 1
and 1
gnashing 1
of 1
teeth 1
Inflamed 1
by 1
pain 1
I 1
vowed 1
eternal 1
hatred 1
and 1
vengeance 1
to 1
all 1
mankind 1
But 1
the 1
agony 1
of 1
my 1
wound 1
overcame 1
me 1
my 1
pulses 1
paused 1
and 1
I 1
fainted 1
For 1
some 1
weeks 1
I 1
led 1
a 1
miserable 1
life 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
cure 1
the 1
wound 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
received 1
The 1
ball 1
had 1
entered 1
my 1
shoulder 1
and 1
I 1
knew 1
not 1
whether 1
it 1
had 1
remained 1
there 1
or 1
passed 1
through 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
means 1
of 1
extracting 1
it 1
My 1
sufferings 1
were 1
augmented 1
also 1
by 1
the 1
oppressive 1
sense 1
of 1
the 1
injustice 1
and 1
ingratitude 1
of 1
their 1
infliction 1
My 1
daily 1
vows 1
rose 1
for 1
revenge 1
a 1
deep 1
and 1
deadly 1
revenge 1
such 1
as 1
would 1
alone 1
compensate 1
for 1
the 1
outrages 1
and 1
anguish 1
I 1
had 1
endured 1
After 1
some 1
weeks 1
my 1
wound 1
healed 1
and 1
I 1
continued 1
my 1
journey 1
The 1
labours 1
I 1
endured 1
were 1
no 1
longer 1
to 1
be 1
alleviated 1
by 1
the 1
bright 1
sun 1
or 1
gentle 1
breezes 1
of 1
spring 1
all 1
joy 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
mockery 1
which 1
insulted 1
my 1
desolate 1
state 1
and 1
made 1
me 1
feel 1
more 1
painfully 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
made 1
for 1
the 1
enjoyment 1
of 1
pleasure 1
But 1
my 1
toils 1
now 1
drew 1
near 1
a 1
close 1
and 1
in 1
two 1
months 1
from 1
this 1
time 1
I 1
reached 1
the 1
environs 1
of 1
Geneva 1
It 1
was 1
evening 1
when 1
I 1
arrived 1
and 1
I 1
retired 1
to 1
a 1
hiding 1
place 1
among 1
the 1
fields 1
that 1
surround 1
it 1
to 1
meditate 1
in 1
what 1
manner 1
I 1
should 1
apply 1
to 1
you 1
I 1
was 1
oppressed 1
by 1
fatigue 1
and 1
hunger 1
and 1
far 1
too 1
unhappy 1
to 1
enjoy 1
the 1
gentle 1
breezes 1
of 1
evening 1
or 1
the 1
prospect 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
setting 1
behind 1
the 1
stupendous 1
mountains 1
of 1
Jura 1
At 1
this 1
time 1
a 1
slight 1
sleep 1
relieved 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
pain 1
of 1
reflection 1
which 1
was 1
disturbed 1
by 1
the 1
approach 1
of 1
a 1
beautiful 1
child 1
who 1
came 1
running 1
into 1
the 1
recess 1
I 1
had 1
chosen 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
sportiveness 1
of 1
infancy 1
Suddenly 1
as 1
I 1
gazed 1
on 1
him 1
an 1
idea 1
seized 1
me 1
that 1
this 1
little 1
creature 1
was 1
unprejudiced 1
and 1
had 1
lived 1
too 1
short 1
a 1
time 1
to 1
have 1
imbibed 1
a 1
horror 1
of 1
deformity 1
If 1
therefore 1
I 1
could 1
seize 1
him 1
and 1
educate 1
him 1
as 1
my 1
companion 1
and 1
friend 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
so 1
desolate 1
in 1
this 1
peopled 1
earth 1
Urged 1
by 1
this 1
impulse 1
I 1
seized 1
on 1
the 1
boy 1
as 1
he 1
passed 1
and 1
drew 1
him 1
towards 1
me 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
beheld 1
my 1
form 1
he 1
placed 1
his 1
hands 1
before 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
uttered 1
a 1
shrill 1
scream 1
I 1
drew 1
his 1
hand 1
forcibly 1
from 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
said 1
Child 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
this 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
intend 1
to 1
hurt 1
you 1
listen 1
to 1
me 1
He 1
struggled 1
violently 1
Let 1
me 1
go 1
he 1
cried 1
monster 1
Ugly 1
wretch 1
You 1
wish 1
to 1
eat 1
me 1
and 1
tear 1
me 1
to 1
pieces 1
You 1
are 1
an 1
ogre 1
Let 1
me 1
go 1
or 1
I 1
will 1
tell 1
my 1
papa 1
Boy 1
you 1
will 1
never 1
see 1
your 1
father 1
again 1
you 1
must 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
Hideous 1
monster 1
Let 1
me 1
go 1
My 1
papa 1
is 1
a 1
syndic 1
he 1
is 1
M 1
Frankenstein 1
he 1
will 1
punish 1
you 1
You 1
dare 1
not 1
keep 1
me 1
Frankenstein 1
you 1
belong 1
then 1
to 1
my 1
enemy 1
to 1
him 1
towards 1
whom 1
I 1
have 1
sworn 1
eternal 1
revenge 1
you 1
shall 1
be 1
my 1
first 1
victim 1
The 1
child 1
still 1
struggled 1
and 1
loaded 1
me 1
with 1
epithets 1
which 1
carried 1
despair 1
to 1
my 1
heart 1
I 1
grasped 1
his 1
throat 1
to 1
silence 1
him 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
he 1
lay 1
dead 1
at 1
my 1
feet 1
I 1
gazed 1
on 1
my 1
victim 1
and 1
my 1
heart 1
swelled 1
with 1
exultation 1
and 1
hellish 1
triumph 1
clapping 1
my 1
hands 1
I 1
exclaimed 1
I 1
too 1
can 1
create 1
desolation 1
my 1
enemy 1
is 1
not 1
invulnerable 1
this 1
death 1
will 1
carry 1
despair 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
a 1
thousand 1
other 1
miseries 1
shall 1
torment 1
and 1
destroy 1
him 1
As 1
I 1
fixed 1
my 1
eyes 1
on 1
the 1
child 1
I 1
saw 1
something 1
glittering 1
on 1
his 1
breast 1
I 1
took 1
it 2
was 1
a 1
portrait 1
of 1
a 1
most 1
lovely 1
woman 1
In 1
spite 1
of 1
my 1
malignity 1
it 1
softened 1
and 1
attracted 1
me 1
For 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
I 1
gazed 1
with 1
delight 1
on 1
her 1
dark 1
eyes 1
fringed 1
by 1
deep 1
lashes 1
and 1
her 1
lovely 1
lips 1
but 1
presently 1
my 1
rage 1
returned 1
I 1
remembered 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
forever 1
deprived 1
of 1
the 1
delights 1
that 1
such 1
beautiful 1
creatures 1
could 1
bestow 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
whose 1
resemblance 1
I 1
contemplated 1
would 1
in 1
regarding 1
me 1
have 1
changed 1
that 1
air 1
of 1
divine 1
benignity 1
to 1
one 1
expressive 1
of 1
disgust 1
and 1
affright 1
Can 1
you 1
wonder 1
that 1
such 1
thoughts 1
transported 1
me 1
with 1
rage 1
I 1
only 1
wonder 1
that 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
instead 1
of 1
venting 1
my 1
sensations 1
in 1
exclamations 1
and 1
agony 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
rush 1
among 1
mankind 1
and 1
perish 1
in 1
the 1
attempt 1
to 1
destroy 1
them 1
While 1
I 1
was 1
overcome 1
by 1
these 1
feelings 1
I 1
left 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
I 1
had 1
committed 1
the 1
murder 1
and 1
seeking 1
a 1
more 1
secluded 1
hiding 1
place 1
I 1
entered 1
a 1
barn 1
which 1
had 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
empty 1
A 1
woman 1
was 1
sleeping 1
on 1
some 1
straw 1
she 1
was 1
young 1
not 1
indeed 1
so 1
beautiful 1
as 1
her 1
whose 1
portrait 1
I 1
held 1
but 1
of 1
an 1
agreeable 1
aspect 1
and 1
blooming 1
in 1
the 1
loveliness 1
of 1
youth 1
and 1
health 1
Here 1
I 1
thought 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
whose 1
joy 1
imparting 1
smiles 1
are 1
bestowed 1
on 1
all 1
but 1
me 1
And 1
then 1
I 1
bent 1
over 1
her 1
and 1
whispered 1
Awake 1
fairest 1
thy 1
lover 1
is 1
near 1
he 1
who 1
would 1
give 1
his 1
life 1
but 1
to 1
obtain 1
one 1
look 1
of 1
affection 1
from 1
thine 1
eyes 1
my 1
beloved 1
awake 1
The 1
sleeper 1
stirred 1
a 1
thrill 1
of 1
terror 1
ran 1
through 1
me 1
Should 1
she 1
indeed 1
awake 1
and 1
see 1
me 1
and 1
curse 1
me 1
and 1
denounce 1
the 1
murderer 1
Thus 1
would 1
she 1
assuredly 1
act 1
if 1
her 1
darkened 1
eyes 1
opened 1
and 1
she 1
beheld 1
me 1
The 1
thought 1
was 1
madness 1
it 1
stirred 1
the 1
fiend 1
within 1
me 1
not 1
I 1
but 1
she 1
shall 1
suffer 1
the 1
murder 1
I 1
have 1
committed 1
because 1
I 1
am 1
forever 1
robbed 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
give 1
me 1
she 1
shall 1
atone 1
The 1
crime 1
had 1
its 1
source 1
in 1
her 1
be 1
hers 1
the 1
punishment 1
Thanks 1
to 1
the 1
lessons 1
of 1
Felix 1
and 1
the 1
sanguinary 1
laws 1
of 1
man 1
I 1
had 1
learned 1
now 1
to 1
work 1
mischief 1
I 1
bent 1
over 1
her 1
and 1
placed 1
the 1
portrait 1
securely 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
folds 1
of 1
her 1
dress 1
She 1
moved 1
again 1
and 1
I 1
fled 1
For 1
some 1
days 1
I 1
haunted 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
these 1
scenes 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
sometimes 1
wishing 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
sometimes 1
resolved 1
to 1
quit 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
its 1
miseries 1
forever 1
At 1
length 1
I 1
wandered 1
towards 1
these 1
mountains 1
and 1
have 1
ranged 1
through 1
their 1
immense 1
recesses 1
consumed 1
by 1
a 1
burning 1
passion 1
which 1
you 1
alone 1
can 1
gratify 1
We 1
may 1
not 1
part 1
until 1
you 1
have 1
promised 1
to 1
comply 1
with 1
my 1
requisition 1
I 1
am 1
alone 1
and 1
miserable 1
man 1
will 1
not 1
associate 1
with 1
me 1
but 1
one 1
as 1
deformed 1
and 1
horrible 1
as 1
myself 1
would 1
not 1
deny 1
herself 1
to 1
me 1
My 1
companion 1
must 1
be 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
species 1
and 1
have 1
the 1
same 1
defects 1
This 1
being 1
you 1
must 1
create 1
Chapter 1
The 1
being 1
finished 1
speaking 1
and 1
fixed 1
his 1
looks 1
upon 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
expectation 1
of 1
a 1
reply 1
But 1
I 1
was 1
bewildered 1
perplexed 1
and 1
unable 1
to 1
arrange 1
my 1
ideas 1
sufficiently 1
to 1
understand 1
the 1
full 1
extent 1
of 1
his 1
proposition 1
He 1
continued 1
You 1
must 1
create 1
a 1
female 1
for 1
me 1
with 1
whom 1
I 1
can 1
live 1
in 1
the 1
interchange 1
of 1
those 1
sympathies 1
necessary 1
for 1
my 1
being 1
This 1
you 1
alone 1
can 1
do 1
and 1
I 1
demand 1
it 1
of 1
you 1
as 1
a 1
right 1
which 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
refuse 1
to 1
concede 1
The 1
latter 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
tale 1
had 1
kindled 1
anew 1
in 1
me 1
the 1
anger 1
that 1
had 1
died 1
away 1
while 1
he 1
narrated 1
his 1
peaceful 1
life 1
among 1
the 1
cottagers 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
this 1
I 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
suppress 1
the 1
rage 1
that 1
burned 1
within 1
me 1
I 1
do 1
refuse 1
it 1
I 1
replied 1
and 1
no 1
torture 1
shall 1
ever 1
extort 1
a 1
consent 1
from 1
me 1
You 1
may 1
render 1
me 1
the 1
most 1
miserable 1
of 1
men 1
but 1
you 1
shall 1
never 1
make 1
me 1
base 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
eyes 1
Shall 1
I 1
create 1
another 1
like 1
yourself 1
whose 1
joint 1
wickedness 1
might 1
desolate 1
the 1
world 1
Begone 1
I 1
have 1
answered 1
you 2
may 1
torture 1
me 1
but 1
I 1
will 1
never 1
consent 1
You 1
are 1
in 1
the 1
wrong 1
replied 1
the 1
fiend 1
and 1
instead 1
of 1
threatening 1
I 1
am 1
content 1
to 1
reason 1
with 1
you 1
I 1
am 1
malicious 1
because 1
I 1
am 1
miserable 1
Am 1
I 1
not 1
shunned 1
and 1
hated 1
by 1
all 1
mankind 1
You 1
my 1
creator 1
would 1
tear 1
me 1
to 1
pieces 1
and 1
triumph 1
remember 1
that 1
and 1
tell 1
me 1
why 1
I 1
should 1
pity 1
man 1
more 1
than 1
he 1
pities 1
me 1
You 1
would 1
not 1
call 1
it 1
murder 1
if 1
you 1
could 1
precipitate 1
me 1
into 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
ice 1
rifts 1
and 1
destroy 1
my 1
frame 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
your 1
own 1
hands 1
Shall 1
I 1
respect 1
man 1
when 1
he 1
condemns 1
me 1
Let 1
him 1
live 1
with 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
interchange 1
of 1
kindness 1
and 1
instead 1
of 1
injury 1
I 1
would 1
bestow 1
every 1
benefit 1
upon 1
him 1
with 1
tears 1
of 1
gratitude 1
at 1
his 1
acceptance 1
But 1
that 1
cannot 1
be 1
the 1
human 1
senses 1
are 1
insurmountable 1
barriers 1
to 1
our 1
union 1
Yet 1
mine 1
shall 1
not 1
be 1
the 1
submission 1
of 1
abject 1
slavery 1
I 1
will 1
revenge 1
my 1
injuries 1
if 1
I 1
cannot 1
inspire 1
love 1
I 1
will 1
cause 1
fear 1
and 1
chiefly 1
towards 1
you 1
my 1
arch 1
enemy 1
because 1
my 1
creator 1
do 1
I 1
swear 1
inextinguishable 1
hatred 1
Have 1
a 1
care 1
I 1
will 1
work 1
at 1
your 1
destruction 1
nor 1
finish 1
until 1
I 1
desolate 1
your 1
heart 1
so 1
that 1
you 1
shall 1
curse 1
the 1
hour 1
of 1
your 1
birth 1
A 1
fiendish 1
rage 1
animated 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
this 1
his 1
face 1
was 1
wrinkled 1
into 1
contortions 1
too 1
horrible 1
for 1
human 1
eyes 1
to 1
behold 1
but 1
presently 1
he 1
calmed 1
himself 1
and 1
proceeded 1
I 1
intended 1
to 1
reason 1
This 1
passion 1
is 1
detrimental 1
to 1
me 1
for 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
reflect 1
that 1
YOU 1
are 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
its 1
excess 1
If 1
any 1
being 1
felt 1
emotions 1
of 1
benevolence 1
towards 1
me 1
I 1
should 1
return 1
them 1
a 1
hundred 1
and 1
a 1
hundredfold 1
for 1
that 1
one 1
creature 1
s 1
sake 1
I 1
would 1
make 1
peace 1
with 1
the 1
whole 1
kind 1
But 1
I 1
now 1
indulge 1
in 1
dreams 1
of 1
bliss 1
that 1
cannot 1
be 1
realized 1
What 1
I 1
ask 1
of 1
you 1
is 1
reasonable 1
and 1
moderate 1
I 1
demand 1
a 1
creature 1
of 1
another 1
sex 1
but 1
as 1
hideous 1
as 1
myself 1
the 1
gratification 1
is 1
small 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
that 1
I 1
can 1
receive 1
and 1
it 1
shall 1
content 1
me 1
It 1
is 1
true 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
monsters 1
cut 1
off 1
from 1
all 1
the 1
world 1
but 1
on 1
that 1
account 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
more 1
attached 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
Our 1
lives 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
happy 1
but 1
they 1
will 1
be 1
harmless 1
and 1
free 1
from 1
the 1
misery 1
I 1
now 1
feel 1
Oh 1
My 1
creator 1
make 1
me 1
happy 1
let 1
me 1
feel 1
gratitude 1
towards 1
you 1
for 1
one 1
benefit 1
Let 1
me 1
see 1
that 1
I 1
excite 1
the 1
sympathy 1
of 1
some 1
existing 1
thing 1
do 1
not 1
deny 1
me 1
my 1
request 1
I 1
was 1
moved 1
I 1
shuddered 1
when 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
possible 1
consequences 1
of 1
my 1
consent 1
but 1
I 1
felt 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
some 1
justice 1
in 1
his 1
argument 1
His 1
tale 1
and 1
the 1
feelings 1
he 1
now 1
expressed 1
proved 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
creature 1
of 1
fine 1
sensations 1
and 1
did 1
I 1
not 1
as 1
his 1
maker 1
owe 1
him 1
all 1
the 1
portion 1
of 1
happiness 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
to 1
bestow 1
He 1
saw 1
my 1
change 1
of 1
feeling 1
and 1
continued 1
If 1
you 1
consent 1
neither 1
you 1
nor 1
any 1
other 1
human 1
being 1
shall 1
ever 1
see 1
us 1
again 1
I 1
will 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
vast 1
wilds 1
of 1
South 1
America 1
My 1
food 1
is 1
not 1
that 1
of 1
man 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
destroy 1
the 1
lamb 1
and 1
the 1
kid 1
to 1
glut 1
my 1
appetite 1
acorns 1
and 1
berries 1
afford 1
me 1
sufficient 1
nourishment 1
My 1
companion 1
will 1
be 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
nature 1
as 1
myself 1
and 1
will 1
be 1
content 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
fare 1
We 1
shall 1
make 1
our 1
bed 1
of 1
dried 1
leaves 1
the 1
sun 1
will 1
shine 1
on 1
us 1
as 1
on 1
man 1
and 1
will 1
ripen 1
our 1
food 1
The 1
picture 1
I 1
present 1
to 1
you 1
is 1
peaceful 1
and 1
human 1
and 1
you 1
must 1
feel 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
deny 1
it 1
only 1
in 1
the 1
wantonness 1
of 1
power 1
and 1
cruelty 1
Pitiless 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
towards 1
me 1
I 1
now 1
see 1
compassion 1
in 1
your 1
eyes 1
let 1
me 1
seize 1
the 1
favourable 1
moment 1
and 1
persuade 1
you 1
to 1
promise 1
what 1
I 1
so 1
ardently 1
desire 1
You 1
propose 1
replied 1
I 1
to 1
fly 1
from 1
the 1
habitations 1
of 1
man 1
to 1
dwell 1
in 1
those 1
wilds 1
where 1
the 1
beasts 1
of 1
the 1
field 1
will 1
be 1
your 1
only 1
companions 1
How 1
can 1
you 1
who 1
long 1
for 1
the 1
love 1
and 1
sympathy 1
of 1
man 1
persevere 1
in 1
this 1
exile 1
You 1
will 1
return 1
and 1
again 1
seek 1
their 1
kindness 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
meet 1
with 1
their 1
detestation 1
your 1
evil 1
passions 1
will 1
be 1
renewed 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
then 1
have 1
a 1
companion 1
to 1
aid 1
you 1
in 1
the 1
task 1
of 1
destruction 1
This 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
cease 1
to 1
argue 1
the 1
point 1
for 1
I 1
cannot 1
consent 1
How 1
inconstant 1
are 1
your 1
feelings 1
But 1
a 1
moment 1
ago 1
you 1
were 1
moved 1
by 1
my 1
representations 1
and 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
again 1
harden 1
yourself 1
to 1
my 1
complaints 1
I 1
swear 1
to 1
you 1
by 1
the 1
earth 1
which 1
I 1
inhabit 1
and 1
by 1
you 1
that 1
made 1
me 1
that 1
with 1
the 1
companion 1
you 1
bestow 1
I 1
will 1
quit 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
man 1
and 1
dwell 1
as 1
it 1
may 1
chance 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
savage 1
of 1
places 1
My 1
evil 1
passions 1
will 1
have 1
fled 1
for 1
I 1
shall 1
meet 1
with 1
sympathy 1
My 1
life 1
will 1
flow 1
quietly 1
away 1
and 1
in 1
my 1
dying 1
moments 1
I 1
shall 1
not 1
curse 1
my 1
maker 1
His 1
words 1
had 1
a 1
strange 1
effect 1
upon 1
me 1
I 1
compassionated 1
him 1
and 1
sometimes 1
felt 1
a 1
wish 1
to 1
console 1
him 1
but 1
when 1
I 1
looked 1
upon 1
him 1
when 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
filthy 1
mass 1
that 1
moved 1
and 1
talked 1
my 1
heart 1
sickened 1
and 1
my 1
feelings 1
were 1
altered 1
to 1
those 1
of 1
horror 1
and 1
hatred 1
I 1
tried 1
to 1
stifle 1
these 1
sensations 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
sympathize 1
with 1
him 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
right 1
to 1
withhold 1
from 1
him 1
the 1
small 1
portion 1
of 1
happiness 1
which 1
was 1
yet 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
to 1
bestow 1
You 1
swear 1
I 1
said 1
to 1
be 1
harmless 1
but 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
already 1
shown 1
a 1
degree 1
of 1
malice 1
that 1
should 1
reasonably 1
make 1
me 1
distrust 1
you 1
May 1
not 1
even 1
this 1
be 1
a 1
feint 1
that 1
will 1
increase 1
your 1
triumph 1
by 1
affording 1
a 1
wider 1
scope 1
for 1
your 1
revenge 1
How 1
is 1
this 1
I 1
must 1
not 1
be 1
trifled 1
with 1
and 1
I 1
demand 1
an 1
answer 1
If 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
ties 1
and 1
no 1
affections 1
hatred 1
and 1
vice 1
must 1
be 1
my 1
portion 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
another 1
will 1
destroy 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
my 1
crimes 1
and 1
I 1
shall 1
become 1
a 1
thing 1
of 1
whose 1
existence 1
everyone 1
will 1
be 1
ignorant 1
My 1
vices 1
are 1
the 1
children 1
of 1
a 1
forced 1
solitude 1
that 1
I 1
abhor 1
and 1
my 1
virtues 1
will 1
necessarily 1
arise 1
when 1
I 1
live 1
in 1
communion 1
with 1
an 1
equal 1
I 1
shall 1
feel 1
the 1
affections 1
of 1
a 1
sensitive 1
being 1
and 1
become 1
linked 1
to 1
the 1
chain 1
of 1
existence 1
and 1
events 1
from 1
which 1
I 1
am 1
now 1
excluded 1
I 1
paused 1
some 1
time 1
to 1
reflect 1
on 1
all 1
he 1
had 1
related 1
and 1
the 1
various 1
arguments 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
employed 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
promise 1
of 1
virtues 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
displayed 1
on 1
the 1
opening 1
of 1
his 1
existence 1
and 1
the 1
subsequent 1
blight 1
of 1
all 1
kindly 1
feeling 1
by 1
the 1
loathing 1
and 1
scorn 1
which 1
his 1
protectors 1
had 1
manifested 1
towards 1
him 1
His 1
power 1
and 1
threats 1
were 1
not 1
omitted 1
in 1
my 1
calculations 1
a 1
creature 1
who 1
could 1
exist 1
in 1
the 1
ice 1
caves 1
of 1
the 1
glaciers 1
and 1
hide 1
himself 1
from 1
pursuit 1
among 1
the 1
ridges 1
of 1
inaccessible 1
precipices 1
was 1
a 1
being 1
possessing 1
faculties 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
vain 1
to 1
cope 1
with 1
After 1
a 1
long 1
pause 1
of 1
reflection 1
I 1
concluded 1
that 1
the 1
justice 1
due 1
both 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
demanded 1
of 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
comply 1
with 1
his 1
request 1
Turning 1
to 1
him 1
therefore 1
I 1
said 1
I 1
consent 1
to 1
your 1
demand 1
on 1
your 1
solemn 1
oath 1
to 1
quit 1
Europe 1
forever 1
and 1
every 1
other 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
man 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
I 1
shall 1
deliver 1
into 1
your 1
hands 1
a 1
female 1
who 1
will 1
accompany 1
you 1
in 1
your 1
exile 1
I 1
swear 1
he 1
cried 1
by 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
blue 1
sky 1
of 1
heaven 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
of 1
love 1
that 1
burns 1
my 1
heart 1
that 1
if 1
you 1
grant 1
my 1
prayer 1
while 1
they 1
exist 1
you 1
shall 1
never 1
behold 1
me 1
again 1
Depart 1
to 1
your 1
home 1
and 1
commence 1
your 1
labours 1
I 1
shall 1
watch 1
their 1
progress 1
with 1
unutterable 1
anxiety 1
and 1
fear 1
not 1
but 1
that 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
ready 1
I 1
shall 1
appear 1
Saying 1
this 1
he 1
suddenly 1
quitted 1
me 1
fearful 1
perhaps 1
of 1
any 1
change 1
in 1
my 1
sentiments 1
I 1
saw 1
him 1
descend 1
the 1
mountain 1
with 1
greater 1
speed 1
than 1
the 1
flight 1
of 1
an 1
eagle 1
and 1
quickly 1
lost 1
among 1
the 1
undulations 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
of 1
ice 1
His 1
tale 1
had 1
occupied 1
the 1
whole 1
day 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
upon 1
the 1
verge 1
of 1
the 1
horizon 1
when 1
he 1
departed 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
I 1
ought 1
to 1
hasten 1
my 1
descent 1
towards 1
the 1
valley 1
as 1
I 1
should 1
soon 1
be 1
encompassed 1
in 1
darkness 1
but 1
my 1
heart 1
was 1
heavy 1
and 1
my 1
steps 1
slow 1
The 1
labour 1
of 1
winding 1
among 1
the 1
little 1
paths 1
of 1
the 1
mountain 1
and 1
fixing 1
my 1
feet 1
firmly 1
as 1
I 1
advanced 1
perplexed 1
me 1
occupied 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
by 1
the 1
emotions 1
which 1
the 1
occurrences 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
had 1
produced 1
Night 1
was 1
far 1
advanced 1
when 1
I 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
halfway 1
resting 1
place 1
and 1
seated 1
myself 1
beside 1
the 1
fountain 1
The 1
stars 1
shone 1
at 1
intervals 1
as 1
the 1
clouds 1
passed 1
from 1
over 1
them 1
the 1
dark 1
pines 1
rose 1
before 1
me 1
and 1
every 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
a 1
broken 1
tree 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
scene 1
of 1
wonderful 1
solemnity 1
and 1
stirred 1
strange 1
thoughts 1
within 1
me 1
I 1
wept 1
bitterly 1
and 1
clasping 1
my 1
hands 1
in 1
agony 1
I 1
exclaimed 1
Oh 1
Stars 1
and 1
clouds 1
and 1
winds 1
ye 1
are 1
all 1
about 1
to 1
mock 1
me 1
if 1
ye 1
really 1
pity 1
me 1
crush 1
sensation 1
and 1
memory 1
let 1
me 1
become 1
as 1
nought 1
but 1
if 1
not 1
depart 2
and 1
leave 1
me 1
in 1
darkness 1
These 1
were 1
wild 1
and 1
miserable 1
thoughts 1
but 1
I 1
cannot 1
describe 1
to 1
you 1
how 1
the 1
eternal 1
twinkling 1
of 1
the 1
stars 1
weighed 1
upon 1
me 1
and 1
how 1
I 1
listened 1
to 1
every 1
blast 1
of 1
wind 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
a 1
dull 1
ugly 1
siroc 1
on 1
its 1
way 1
to 1
consume 1
me 1
Morning 1
dawned 1
before 1
I 1
arrived 1
at 1
the 1
village 1
of 1
Chamounix 1
I 1
took 1
no 1
rest 1
but 1
returned 1
immediately 1
to 1
Geneva 1
Even 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
heart 1
I 1
could 1
give 1
no 1
expression 1
to 1
my 1
sensations 1
they 1
weighed 1
on 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
mountain 1
s 1
weight 1
and 1
their 1
excess 1
destroyed 1
my 1
agony 1
beneath 1
them 1
Thus 1
I 1
returned 1
home 1
and 1
entering 1
the 1
house 1
presented 1
myself 1
to 1
the 1
family 1
My 1
haggard 1
and 1
wild 1
appearance 1
awoke 1
intense 1
alarm 1
but 1
I 1
answered 1
no 1
question 1
scarcely 1
did 1
I 1
speak 1
I 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
I 1
were 1
placed 1
under 1
a 1
ban 1
as 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
right 1
to 1
claim 1
their 1
sympathies 1
as 1
if 1
never 1
more 1
might 1
I 1
enjoy 1
companionship 1
with 1
them 1
Yet 1
even 1
thus 1
I 1
loved 1
them 1
to 1
adoration 1
and 1
to 1
save 1
them 1
I 1
resolved 1
to 1
dedicate 1
myself 1
to 1
my 1
most 1
abhorred 1
task 1
The 1
prospect 1
of 1
such 1
an 1
occupation 1
made 1
every 1
other 1
circumstance 1
of 1
existence 1
pass 1
before 1
me 1
like 1
a 1
dream 1
and 1
that 1
thought 1
only 1
had 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
reality 1
of 1
life 1
Chapter 1
Day 1
after 1
day 1
week 1
after 1
week 1
passed 1
away 1
on 1
my 1
return 1
to 1
Geneva 1
and 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
collect 1
the 1
courage 1
to 1
recommence 1
my 1
work 1
I 1
feared 1
the 1
vengeance 1
of 1
the 1
disappointed 1
fiend 1
yet 1
I 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
overcome 1
my 1
repugnance 1
to 1
the 1
task 1
which 1
was 1
enjoined 1
me 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
compose 1
a 1
female 1
without 1
again 1
devoting 1
several 1
months 1
to 1
profound 1
study 1
and 1
laborious 1
disquisition 1
I 1
had 1
heard 1
of 1
some 1
discoveries 1
having 1
been 1
made 1
by 1
an 1
English 1
philosopher 1
the 1
knowledge 1
of 1
which 1
was 1
material 1
to 1
my 1
success 1
and 1
I 1
sometimes 1
thought 1
of 1
obtaining 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
consent 1
to 1
visit 1
England 1
for 1
this 1
purpose 1
but 1
I 1
clung 1
to 1
every 1
pretence 1
of 1
delay 1
and 1
shrank 1
from 1
taking 1
the 1
first 1
step 1
in 1
an 1
undertaking 1
whose 1
immediate 1
necessity 1
began 1
to 1
appear 1
less 1
absolute 1
to 1
me 1
A 1
change 1
indeed 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
in 1
me 1
my 1
health 1
which 1
had 1
hitherto 1
declined 1
was 1
now 1
much 1
restored 1
and 1
my 1
spirits 1
when 1
unchecked 1
by 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
my 1
unhappy 1
promise 1
rose 1
proportionably 1
My 1
father 1
saw 1
this 1
change 1
with 1
pleasure 1
and 1
he 1
turned 1
his 1
thoughts 1
towards 1
the 1
best 1
method 1
of 1
eradicating 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
my 1
melancholy 1
which 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
would 1
return 1
by 1
fits 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
devouring 1
blackness 1
overcast 1
the 1
approaching 1
sunshine 1
At 1
these 1
moments 1
I 1
took 1
refuge 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
perfect 1
solitude 1
I 1
passed 1
whole 1
days 1
on 1
the 1
lake 1
alone 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
boat 1
watching 1
the 1
clouds 1
and 1
listening 1
to 1
the 1
rippling 1
of 1
the 1
waves 1
silent 1
and 1
listless 1
But 1
the 1
fresh 1
air 1
and 1
bright 1
sun 1
seldom 1
failed 1
to 1
restore 1
me 1
to 1
some 1
degree 1
of 1
composure 1
and 1
on 1
my 1
return 1
I 1
met 1
the 1
salutations 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
with 1
a 1
readier 1
smile 1
and 1
a 1
more 1
cheerful 1
heart 1
It 1
was 1
after 1
my 1
return 1
from 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
rambles 1
that 1
my 1
father 1
calling 1
me 1
aside 1
thus 1
addressed 1
me 1
I 1
am 1
happy 1
to 1
remark 1
my 1
dear 1
son 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
resumed 1
your 1
former 1
pleasures 1
and 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
returning 1
to 1
yourself 1
And 1
yet 1
you 1
are 1
still 1
unhappy 1
and 1
still 1
avoid 1
our 1
society 1
For 1
some 1
time 1
I 1
was 1
lost 1
in 1
conjecture 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
this 1
but 1
yesterday 1
an 1
idea 1
struck 1
me 1
and 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
well 1
founded 1
I 1
conjure 1
you 1
to 1
avow 1
it 1
Reserve 1
on 1
such 1
a 1
point 1
would 1
be 1
not 1
only 1
useless 1
but 1
draw 1
down 1
treble 1
misery 1
on 1
us 1
all 1
I 1
trembled 1
violently 1
at 1
his 1
exordium 1
and 1
my 1
father 1
continued 1
I 1
confess 1
my 1
son 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
always 1
looked 1
forward 1
to 1
your 1
marriage 1
with 1
our 1
dear 1
Elizabeth 1
as 1
the 1
tie 1
of 1
our 1
domestic 1
comfort 1
and 1
the 1
stay 1
of 1
my 1
declining 1
years 1
You 1
were 1
attached 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
from 1
your 1
earliest 1
infancy 1
you 1
studied 1
together 1
and 1
appeared 1
in 1
dispositions 1
and 1
tastes 1
entirely 1
suited 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
But 1
so 1
blind 1
is 1
the 1
experience 1
of 1
man 1
that 1
what 1
I 1
conceived 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
best 1
assistants 1
to 1
my 1
plan 1
may 1
have 1
entirely 1
destroyed 1
it 1
You 1
perhaps 1
regard 1
her 1
as 1
your 1
sister 1
without 1
any 1
wish 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
become 1
your 1
wife 1
Nay 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
met 1
with 1
another 1
whom 1
you 1
may 1
love 1
and 1
considering 1
yourself 1
as 1
bound 1
in 1
honour 1
to 1
Elizabeth 1
this 1
struggle 1
may 1
occasion 1
the 1
poignant 1
misery 1
which 1
you 1
appear 1
to 1
feel 1
My 1
dear 1
father 1
reassure 1
yourself 1
I 1
love 1
my 1
cousin 1
tenderly 1
and 1
sincerely 1
I 1
never 1
saw 1
any 1
woman 1
who 1
excited 1
as 1
Elizabeth 1
does 1
my 1
warmest 1
admiration 1
and 1
affection 1
My 1
future 1
hopes 1
and 1
prospects 1
are 1
entirely 1
bound 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
expectation 1
of 1
our 1
union 1
The 1
expression 1
of 1
your 1
sentiments 1
of 1
this 1
subject 1
my 1
dear 1
Victor 1
gives 1
me 1
more 1
pleasure 1
than 1
I 1
have 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
experienced 1
If 1
you 1
feel 1
thus 1
we 1
shall 1
assuredly 1
be 1
happy 1
however 1
present 1
events 1
may 1
cast 1
a 1
gloom 1
over 1
us 1
But 1
it 1
is 1
this 1
gloom 1
which 1
appears 1
to 1
have 1
taken 1
so 1
strong 1
a 1
hold 1
of 1
your 1
mind 1
that 1
I 1
wish 1
to 1
dissipate 1
Tell 1
me 1
therefore 1
whether 1
you 1
object 1
to 1
an 1
immediate 1
solemnization 1
of 1
the 1
marriage 1
We 1
have 1
been 1
unfortunate 1
and 1
recent 1
events 1
have 1
drawn 1
us 1
from 1
that 1
everyday 1
tranquillity 1
befitting 1
my 1
years 1
and 1
infirmities 1
You 1
are 1
younger 1
yet 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
suppose 1
possessed 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
of 1
a 1
competent 1
fortune 1
that 1
an 1
early 1
marriage 1
would 1
at 1
all 1
interfere 1
with 1
any 1
future 1
plans 1
of 1
honour 1
and 1
utility 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
formed 1
Do 1
not 1
suppose 1
however 1
that 1
I 1
wish 1
to 1
dictate 1
happiness 1
to 1
you 1
or 1
that 1
a 1
delay 1
on 1
your 1
part 1
would 1
cause 1
me 1
any 1
serious 1
uneasiness 1
Interpret 1
my 1
words 1
with 1
candour 1
and 1
answer 1
me 1
I 1
conjure 1
you 1
with 1
confidence 1
and 1
sincerity 1
I 1
listened 1
to 1
my 1
father 1
in 1
silence 1
and 1
remained 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
incapable 1
of 1
offering 1
any 1
reply 1
I 1
revolved 1
rapidly 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
a 1
multitude 1
of 1
thoughts 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
arrive 1
at 1
some 1
conclusion 1
Alas 1
To 1
me 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
an 1
immediate 1
union 1
with 1
my 1
Elizabeth 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
horror 1
and 1
dismay 1
I 1
was 1
bound 1
by 1
a 1
solemn 1
promise 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
fulfilled 1
and 1
dared 1
not 1
break 1
or 1
if 1
I 1
did 1
what 1
manifold 1
miseries 1
might 1
not 1
impend 1
over 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
devoted 1
family 1
Could 1
I 1
enter 1
into 1
a 1
festival 1
with 1
this 1
deadly 1
weight 1
yet 1
hanging 1
round 1
my 1
neck 1
and 1
bowing 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
I 1
must 1
perform 1
my 1
engagement 1
and 1
let 1
the 1
monster 1
depart 1
with 1
his 1
mate 1
before 1
I 1
allowed 1
myself 1
to 1
enjoy 1
the 1
delight 1
of 1
a 1
union 1
from 1
which 1
I 1
expected 1
peace 1
I 1
remembered 1
also 1
the 1
necessity 1
imposed 1
upon 1
me 1
of 1
either 1
journeying 1
to 1
England 1
or 1
entering 1
into 1
a 1
long 1
correspondence 1
with 1
those 1
philosophers 1
of 1
that 1
country 1
whose 1
knowledge 1
and 1
discoveries 1
were 1
of 1
indispensable 1
use 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
present 1
undertaking 1
The 1
latter 1
method 1
of 1
obtaining 1
the 1
desired 1
intelligence 1
was 1
dilatory 1
and 1
unsatisfactory 1
besides 1
I 1
had 1
an 1
insurmountable 1
aversion 1
to 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
engaging 1
myself 1
in 1
my 1
loathsome 1
task 1
in 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
house 1
while 1
in 1
habits 1
of 1
familiar 1
intercourse 1
with 1
those 1
I 1
loved 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
a 1
thousand 1
fearful 1
accidents 1
might 1
occur 1
the 1
slightest 1
of 1
which 1
would 1
disclose 1
a 1
tale 1
to 1
thrill 1
all 1
connected 1
with 1
me 1
with 1
horror 1
I 1
was 1
aware 1
also 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
often 1
lose 1
all 1
self 1
command 1
all 1
capacity 1
of 1
hiding 1
the 1
harrowing 1
sensations 1
that 1
would 1
possess 1
me 1
during 1
the 1
progress 1
of 1
my 1
unearthly 1
occupation 1
I 1
must 1
absent 1
myself 1
from 1
all 1
I 1
loved 1
while 1
thus 1
employed 1
Once 1
commenced 1
it 1
would 1
quickly 1
be 1
achieved 1
and 1
I 1
might 1
be 1
restored 1
to 1
my 1
family 1
in 1
peace 1
and 1
happiness 1
My 1
promise 1
fulfilled 1
the 1
monster 1
would 1
depart 1
forever 1
Or 1
so 1
my 1
fond 1
fancy 1
imaged 1
some 1
accident 1
might 1
meanwhile 1
occur 1
to 1
destroy 1
him 1
and 1
put 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
my 1
slavery 1
forever 1
These 1
feelings 1
dictated 1
my 1
answer 1
to 1
my 1
father 1
I 1
expressed 1
a 1
wish 1
to 1
visit 1
England 1
but 1
concealing 1
the 1
true 1
reasons 1
of 1
this 1
request 1
I 1
clothed 1
my 1
desires 1
under 1
a 1
guise 1
which 1
excited 1
no 1
suspicion 1
while 1
I 1
urged 1
my 1
desire 1
with 1
an 1
earnestness 1
that 1
easily 1
induced 1
my 1
father 1
to 1
comply 1
After 1
so 1
long 1
a 1
period 1
of 1
an 1
absorbing 1
melancholy 1
that 1
resembled 1
madness 1
in 1
its 1
intensity 1
and 1
effects 1
he 1
was 1
glad 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
capable 1
of 1
taking 1
pleasure 1
in 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
journey 1
and 1
he 1
hoped 1
that 1
change 1
of 1
scene 1
and 1
varied 1
amusement 1
would 1
before 1
my 1
return 1
have 1
restored 1
me 1
entirely 1
to 1
myself 1
The 1
duration 1
of 1
my 1
absence 1
was 1
left 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
choice 1
a 1
few 1
months 1
or 1
at 1
most 1
a 1
year 1
was 1
the 1
period 1
contemplated 1
One 1
paternal 1
kind 1
precaution 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
to 1
ensure 1
my 1
having 1
a 1
companion 1
Without 1
previously 1
communicating 1
with 1
me 1
he 1
had 1
in 1
concert 1
with 1
Elizabeth 1
arranged 1
that 1
Clerval 1
should 1
join 1
me 1
at 1
Strasbourg 1
This 1
interfered 1
with 1
the 1
solitude 1
I 1
coveted 1
for 1
the 1
prosecution 1
of 1
my 1
task 1
yet 1
at 1
the 1
commencement 1
of 1
my 1
journey 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
my 1
friend 1
could 1
in 1
no 1
way 1
be 1
an 1
impediment 1
and 1
truly 1
I 1
rejoiced 1
that 1
thus 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
saved 1
many 1
hours 1
of 1
lonely 1
maddening 1
reflection 1
Nay 1
Henry 1
might 1
stand 1
between 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
intrusion 1
of 1
my 1
foe 1
If 1
I 1
were 1
alone 1
would 1
he 1
not 1
at 1
times 1
force 1
his 1
abhorred 1
presence 1
on 1
me 1
to 1
remind 1
me 1
of 1
my 1
task 1
or 1
to 1
contemplate 1
its 1
progress 1
To 1
England 1
therefore 1
I 1
was 1
bound 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
understood 1
that 1
my 1
union 1
with 1
Elizabeth 1
should 1
take 1
place 1
immediately 1
on 1
my 1
return 1
My 1
father 1
s 1
age 1
rendered 1
him 1
extremely 1
averse 1
to 1
delay 1
For 1
myself 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
reward 1
I 1
promised 1
myself 1
from 1
my 1
detested 1
toils 1
one 1
consolation 1
for 1
my 1
unparalleled 1
sufferings 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
prospect 1
of 1
that 1
day 1
when 1
enfranchised 1
from 1
my 1
miserable 1
slavery 1
I 1
might 1
claim 1
Elizabeth 1
and 1
forget 1
the 1
past 1
in 1
my 1
union 1
with 1
her 1
I 1
now 1
made 1
arrangements 1
for 1
my 1
journey 1
but 1
one 1
feeling 1
haunted 1
me 1
which 1
filled 1
me 1
with 1
fear 1
and 1
agitation 1
During 1
my 1
absence 1
I 1
should 1
leave 1
my 1
friends 1
unconscious 1
of 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
their 1
enemy 1
and 1
unprotected 1
from 1
his 1
attacks 1
exasperated 1
as 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
by 1
my 1
departure 1
But 1
he 1
had 1
promised 1
to 1
follow 1
me 1
wherever 1
I 1
might 1
go 1
and 1
would 1
he 1
not 1
accompany 1
me 1
to 1
England 1
This 1
imagination 1
was 1
dreadful 1
in 1
itself 1
but 1
soothing 1
inasmuch 1
as 1
it 1
supposed 1
the 1
safety 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
I 1
was 1
agonized 1
with 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
the 1
possibility 1
that 1
the 1
reverse 1
of 1
this 1
might 1
happen 1
But 1
through 1
the 1
whole 1
period 1
during 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
the 1
slave 1
of 1
my 1
creature 1
I 1
allowed 1
myself 1
to 1
be 1
governed 1
by 1
the 1
impulses 1
of 1
the 1
moment 1
and 1
my 1
present 1
sensations 1
strongly 1
intimated 1
that 1
the 1
fiend 1
would 1
follow 1
me 1
and 1
exempt 1
my 1
family 1
from 1
the 1
danger 1
of 1
his 1
machinations 1
It 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
latter 1
end 1
of 1
September 1
that 1
I 1
again 1
quitted 1
my 1
native 1
country 1
My 1
journey 1
had 1
been 1
my 1
own 1
suggestion 1
and 1
Elizabeth 1
therefore 1
acquiesced 1
but 1
she 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
disquiet 1
at 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
my 1
suffering 1
away 1
from 1
her 1
the 1
inroads 1
of 1
misery 1
and 1
grief 1
It 1
had 1
been 1
her 1
care 1
which 1
provided 1
me 1
a 1
companion 1
in 1
Clerval 1
and 1
yet 1
a 1
man 1
is 1
blind 1
to 1
a 1
thousand 1
minute 1
circumstances 1
which 1
call 1
forth 1
a 1
woman 1
s 1
sedulous 1
attention 1
She 1
longed 1
to 1
bid 1
me 1
hasten 1
my 1
return 1
a 1
thousand 1
conflicting 1
emotions 1
rendered 1
her 1
mute 1
as 1
she 1
bade 1
me 1
a 1
tearful 1
silent 1
farewell 1
I 1
threw 1
myself 1
into 1
the 1
carriage 1
that 1
was 1
to 1
convey 1
me 1
away 1
hardly 1
knowing 1
whither 1
I 1
was 1
going 1
and 1
careless 1
of 1
what 1
was 1
passing 1
around 1
I 1
remembered 1
only 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
a 1
bitter 1
anguish 1
that 1
I 1
reflected 1
on 1
it 1
to 1
order 1
that 1
my 1
chemical 1
instruments 1
should 1
be 1
packed 1
to 1
go 1
with 1
me 1
Filled 1
with 1
dreary 1
imaginations 1
I 1
passed 1
through 1
many 1
beautiful 1
and 1
majestic 1
scenes 1
but 1
my 1
eyes 1
were 1
fixed 1
and 1
unobserving 1
I 1
could 1
only 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
bourne 1
of 1
my 1
travels 1
and 1
the 1
work 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
occupy 1
me 1
whilst 1
they 1
endured 1
After 1
some 1
days 1
spent 1
in 1
listless 1
indolence 1
during 1
which 1
I 1
traversed 1
many 1
leagues 1
I 1
arrived 1
at 1
Strasbourg 1
where 1
I 1
waited 1
two 1
days 1
for 1
Clerval 1
He 1
came 1
Alas 1
how 1
great 1
was 1
the 1
contrast 1
between 1
us 1
He 1
was 1
alive 1
to 1
every 1
new 1
scene 1
joyful 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
beauties 1
of 1
the 1
setting 1
sun 1
and 1
more 1
happy 1
when 1
he 1
beheld 1
it 1
rise 1
and 1
recommence 1
a 1
new 1
day 1
He 1
pointed 1
out 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
shifting 1
colours 1
of 1
the 1
landscape 1
and 1
the 1
appearances 1
of 1
the 1
sky 1
This 1
is 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
live 1
he 1
cried 1
how 1
I 1
enjoy 1
existence 1
But 1
you 1
my 1
dear 1
Frankenstein 1
wherefore 1
are 1
you 1
desponding 1
and 1
sorrowful 1
In 1
truth 1
I 1
was 1
occupied 1
by 1
gloomy 1
thoughts 1
and 1
neither 1
saw 1
the 1
descent 1
of 1
the 1
evening 1
star 1
nor 1
the 1
golden 1
sunrise 1
reflected 1
in 1
the 1
Rhine 1
And 1
you 1
my 1
friend 1
would 1
be 1
far 1
more 1
amused 1
with 1
the 1
journal 1
of 1
Clerval 1
who 1
observed 1
the 1
scenery 1
with 1
an 1
eye 1
of 1
feeling 1
and 1
delight 1
than 1
in 1
listening 1
to 1
my 1
reflections 1
I 1
a 1
miserable 1
wretch 1
haunted 1
by 1
a 1
curse 1
that 1
shut 1
up 1
every 1
avenue 1
to 1
enjoyment 1
We 1
had 1
agreed 1
to 1
descend 1
the 1
Rhine 1
in 1
a 1
boat 1
from 1
Strasbourg 1
to 1
Rotterdam 1
whence 1
we 1
might 1
take 1
shipping 1
for 1
London 1
During 1
this 1
voyage 1
we 1
passed 1
many 1
willowy 1
islands 1
and 1
saw 1
several 1
beautiful 1
towns 1
We 1
stayed 1
a 1
day 1
at 1
Mannheim 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
fifth 1
from 1
our 1
departure 1
from 1
Strasbourg 1
arrived 1
at 1
Mainz 1
The 1
course 1
of 1
the 1
Rhine 1
below 1
Mainz 1
becomes 1
much 1
more 1
picturesque 1
The 1
river 1
descends 1
rapidly 1
and 1
winds 1
between 1
hills 1
not 1
high 1
but 1
steep 1
and 1
of 1
beautiful 1
forms 1
We 1
saw 1
many 1
ruined 1
castles 1
standing 1
on 1
the 1
edges 1
of 1
precipices 1
surrounded 1
by 1
black 1
woods 1
high 1
and 1
inaccessible 1
This 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
Rhine 1
indeed 1
presents 1
a 1
singularly 1
variegated 1
landscape 1
In 1
one 1
spot 1
you 1
view 1
rugged 1
hills 1
ruined 1
castles 1
overlooking 1
tremendous 1
precipices 1
with 1
the 1
dark 1
Rhine 1
rushing 1
beneath 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
sudden 1
turn 1
of 1
a 1
promontory 1
flourishing 1
vineyards 1
with 1
green 1
sloping 1
banks 1
and 1
a 1
meandering 1
river 1
and 1
populous 1
towns 1
occupy 1
the 1
scene 1
We 1
travelled 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
the 1
vintage 1
and 1
heard 1
the 1
song 1
of 1
the 1
labourers 1
as 1
we 1
glided 1
down 1
the 1
stream 1
Even 1
I 1
depressed 1
in 1
mind 1
and 1
my 1
spirits 1
continually 1
agitated 1
by 1
gloomy 1
feelings 1
even 1
I 1
was 1
pleased 1
I 1
lay 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
boat 1
and 1
as 1
I 1
gazed 1
on 1
the 1
cloudless 1
blue 1
sky 1
I 1
seemed 1
to 1
drink 1
in 1
a 1
tranquillity 1
to 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
long 1
been 1
a 1
stranger 1
And 1
if 1
these 1
were 1
my 1
sensations 1
who 1
can 1
describe 1
those 1
of 1
Henry 1
He 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
transported 1
to 1
fairy 1
land 1
and 1
enjoyed 1
a 1
happiness 1
seldom 1
tasted 1
by 1
man 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
he 1
said 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
scenes 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
country 1
I 1
have 1
visited 1
the 1
lakes 1
of 1
Lucerne 1
and 1
Uri 1
where 1
the 1
snowy 1
mountains 1
descend 1
almost 1
perpendicularly 1
to 1
the 1
water 1
casting 1
black 1
and 1
impenetrable 1
shades 1
which 1
would 1
cause 1
a 1
gloomy 1
and 1
mournful 1
appearance 1
were 1
it 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
most 1
verdant 1
islands 1
that 1
believe 1
the 1
eye 1
by 1
their 1
gay 1
appearance 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
this 1
lake 1
agitated 1
by 1
a 1
tempest 1
when 1
the 1
wind 1
tore 1
up 1
whirlwinds 1
of 1
water 1
and 1
gave 1
you 1
an 1
idea 1
of 1
what 1
the 1
water 1
spout 1
must 1
be 1
on 1
the 1
great 1
ocean 1
and 1
the 1
waves 1
dash 1
with 1
fury 1
the 1
base 1
of 1
the 1
mountain 1
where 1
the 1
priest 1
and 1
his 1
mistress 1
were 1
overwhelmed 1
by 1
an 1
avalanche 1
and 1
where 1
their 1
dying 1
voices 1
are 1
still 1
said 1
to 1
be 1
heard 1
amid 1
the 1
pauses 1
of 1
the 1
nightly 1
wind 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
the 1
mountains 1
of 1
La 1
Valais 1
and 1
the 1
Pays 1
de 1
Vaud 1
but 1
this 1
country 1
Victor 1
pleases 1
me 1
more 1
than 1
all 1
those 1
wonders 1
The 1
mountains 1
of 1
Switzerland 1
are 1
more 1
majestic 1
and 1
strange 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
charm 1
in 1
the 1
banks 1
of 1
this 1
divine 1
river 1
that 1
I 1
never 1
before 1
saw 1
equalled 1
Look 1
at 1
that 1
castle 1
which 1
overhangs 1
yon 1
precipice 1
and 1
that 1
also 1
on 1
the 1
island 1
almost 1
concealed 1
amongst 1
the 1
foliage 1
of 1
those 1
lovely 1
trees 1
and 1
now 1
that 1
group 1
of 1
labourers 1
coming 1
from 1
among 1
their 1
vines 1
and 1
that 1
village 1
half 1
hid 1
in 1
the 1
recess 1
of 1
the 1
mountain 1
Oh 1
surely 1
the 1
spirit 1
that 1
inhabits 1
and 1
guards 1
this 1
place 1
has 1
a 1
soul 1
more 1
in 1
harmony 1
with 1
man 1
than 1
those 1
who 1
pile 1
the 1
glacier 1
or 1
retire 1
to 1
the 1
inaccessible 1
peaks 1
of 1
the 1
mountains 1
of 1
our 1
own 1
country 1
Clerval 1
Beloved 1
friend 1
Even 1
now 1
it 1
delights 1
me 1
to 1
record 1
your 1
words 1
and 1
to 1
dwell 1
on 1
the 1
praise 1
of 1
which 1
you 1
are 1
so 1
eminently 1
deserving 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
being 1
formed 1
in 1
the 1
very 1
poetry 1
of 1
nature 1
His 1
wild 1
and 1
enthusiastic 1
imagination 1
was 1
chastened 1
by 1
the 1
sensibility 1
of 1
his 1
heart 1
His 1
soul 1
overflowed 1
with 1
ardent 1
affections 1
and 1
his 1
friendship 1
was 1
of 1
that 1
devoted 1
and 1
wondrous 1
nature 1
that 1
the 1
world 1
minded 1
teach 1
us 1
to 1
look 1
for 1
only 1
in 1
the 1
imagination 1
But 1
even 1
human 1
sympathies 1
were 1
not 1
sufficient 1
to 1
satisfy 1
his 1
eager 1
mind 1
The 1
scenery 1
of 1
external 1
nature 1
which 1
others 1
regard 1
only 1
with 1
admiration 1
he 1
loved 1
with 1
ardour 1
The 1
sounding 1
cataract 1
Haunted 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
passion 1
the 1
tall 1
rock 1
The 1
mountain 1
and 1
the 1
deep 1
and 1
gloomy 1
wood 1
Their 1
colours 1
and 1
their 1
forms 1
were 1
then 1
to 1
him 1
An 1
appetite 1
a 1
feeling 1
and 1
a 1
love 1
That 1
had 1
no 1
need 1
of 1
a 1
remoter 1
charm 1
By 1
thought 1
supplied 1
or 1
any 1
interest 1
Unborrow 1
d 1
from 1
the 1
eye 1
Wordsworth 1
s 1
Tintern 1
Abbey 1
And 1
where 1
does 1
he 1
now 1
exist 1
Is 1
this 1
gentle 1
and 1
lovely 1
being 1
lost 1
forever 1
Has 1
this 1
mind 1
so 1
replete 1
with 1
ideas 1
imaginations 1
fanciful 1
and 1
magnificent 1
which 1
formed 1
a 1
world 1
whose 1
existence 1
depended 1
on 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
its 1
creator 1
has 1
this 1
mind 1
perished 1
Does 1
it 1
now 1
only 1
exist 1
in 1
my 1
memory 1
No 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
thus 1
your 1
form 1
so 1
divinely 1
wrought 1
and 1
beaming 1
with 1
beauty 1
has 1
decayed 1
but 1
your 1
spirit 1
still 1
visits 1
and 1
consoles 1
your 1
unhappy 1
friend 1
Pardon 1
this 1
gush 1
of 1
sorrow 1
these 1
ineffectual 1
words 1
are 1
but 1
a 1
slight 1
tribute 1
to 1
the 1
unexampled 1
worth 1
of 1
Henry 1
but 1
they 1
soothe 1
my 1
heart 1
overflowing 1
with 1
the 1
anguish 1
which 1
his 1
remembrance 1
creates 1
I 1
will 1
proceed 1
with 1
my 1
tale 1
Beyond 1
Cologne 1
we 1
descended 1
to 1
the 1
plains 1
of 1
Holland 1
and 1
we 1
resolved 1
to 1
post 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
our 1
way 1
for 1
the 1
wind 1
was 1
contrary 1
and 1
the 1
stream 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
was 1
too 1
gentle 1
to 1
aid 1
us 1
Our 1
journey 1
here 1
lost 1
the 1
interest 1
arising 1
from 1
beautiful 1
scenery 1
but 1
we 1
arrived 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
at 1
Rotterdam 1
whence 1
we 1
proceeded 1
by 1
sea 1
to 1
England 1
It 1
was 1
on 1
a 1
clear 1
morning 1
in 1
the 1
latter 1
days 1
of 1
December 1
that 1
I 1
first 1
saw 1
the 1
white 1
cliffs 1
of 1
Britain 1
The 1
banks 1
of 1
the 1
Thames 1
presented 1
a 1
new 1
scene 1
they 1
were 1
flat 1
but 1
fertile 1
and 1
almost 1
every 1
town 1
was 1
marked 1
by 1
the 1
remembrance 1
of 1
some 1
story 1
We 1
saw 1
Tilbury 1
Fort 1
and 1
remembered 1
the 1
Spanish 1
Armada 1
Gravesend 1
Woolwich 1
and 1
Greenwich 1
places 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
heard 1
of 1
even 1
in 1
my 1
country 1
At 1
length 1
we 1
saw 1
the 1
numerous 1
steeples 1
of 1
London 1
St 1
Paul 1
s 1
towering 1
above 1
all 1
and 1
the 1
Tower 1
famed 1
in 1
English 1
history 1
Chapter 1
London 1
was 1
our 1
present 1
point 1
of 1
rest 1
we 1
determined 1
to 1
remain 1
several 1
months 1
in 1
this 1
wonderful 1
and 1
celebrated 1
city 1
Clerval 1
desired 1
the 1
intercourse 1
of 1
the 1
men 1
of 1
genius 1
and 1
talent 1
who 1
flourished 1
at 1
this 1
time 1
but 1
this 1
was 1
with 1
me 1
a 1
secondary 1
object 1
I 1
was 1
principally 1
occupied 1
with 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
obtaining 1
the 1
information 1
necessary 1
for 1
the 1
completion 1
of 1
my 1
promise 1
and 1
quickly 1
availed 1
myself 1
of 1
the 1
letters 1
of 1
introduction 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
brought 1
with 1
me 1
addressed 1
to 1
the 1
most 1
distinguished 1
natural 1
philosophers 1
If 1
this 1
journey 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
during 1
my 1
days 1
of 1
study 1
and 1
happiness 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
afforded 1
me 1
inexpressible 1
pleasure 1
But 1
a 1
blight 1
had 1
come 1
over 1
my 1
existence 1
and 1
I 1
only 1
visited 1
these 1
people 1
for 1
the 1
sake 1
of 1
the 1
information 1
they 1
might 1
give 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
in 1
which 1
my 1
interest 1
was 1
so 1
terribly 1
profound 1
Company 1
was 1
irksome 1
to 1
me 1
when 1
alone 1
I 1
could 1
fill 1
my 1
mind 1
with 1
the 1
sights 1
of 1
heaven 1
and 1
earth 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
Henry 1
soothed 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
could 1
thus 1
cheat 1
myself 1
into 1
a 1
transitory 1
peace 1
But 1
busy 1
uninteresting 1
joyous 1
faces 1
brought 1
back 1
despair 1
to 1
my 1
heart 1
I 1
saw 1
an 1
insurmountable 1
barrier 1
placed 1
between 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
fellow 1
men 1
this 1
barrier 1
was 1
sealed 1
with 1
the 1
blood 1
of 1
William 1
and 1
Justine 1
and 1
to 1
reflect 1
on 1
the 1
events 1
connected 1
with 1
those 1
names 1
filled 1
my 1
soul 1
with 1
anguish 1
But 1
in 1
Clerval 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
image 1
of 1
my 1
former 1
self 1
he 1
was 1
inquisitive 1
and 1
anxious 1
to 1
gain 1
experience 1
and 1
instruction 1
The 1
difference 1
of 1
manners 1
which 1
he 1
observed 1
was 1
to 1
him 1
an 1
inexhaustible 1
source 1
of 1
instruction 1
and 1
amusement 1
He 1
was 1
also 1
pursuing 1
an 1
object 1
he 1
had 1
long 1
had 1
in 1
view 1
His 1
design 1
was 1
to 1
visit 1
India 1
in 1
the 1
belief 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
in 1
his 1
knowledge 1
of 1
its 1
various 1
languages 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
views 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
of 1
its 1
society 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
materially 1
assisting 1
the 1
progress 1
of 1
European 1
colonization 1
and 1
trade 1
In 1
Britain 1
only 1
could 1
he 1
further 1
the 1
execution 1
of 1
his 1
plan 1
He 1
was 1
forever 1
busy 1
and 1
the 1
only 1
check 1
to 1
his 1
enjoyments 1
was 1
my 1
sorrowful 1
and 1
dejected 1
mind 1
I 1
tried 1
to 1
conceal 1
this 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
possible 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
not 1
debar 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
pleasures 1
natural 1
to 1
one 1
who 1
was 1
entering 1
on 1
a 1
new 1
scene 1
of 1
life 1
undisturbed 1
by 1
any 1
care 1
or 1
bitter 1
recollection 1
I 1
often 1
refused 1
to 1
accompany 1
him 1
alleging 1
another 1
engagement 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
remain 1
alone 1
I 1
now 1
also 1
began 1
to 1
collect 1
the 1
materials 1
necessary 1
for 1
my 1
new 1
creation 1
and 1
this 1
was 1
to 1
me 1
like 1
the 1
torture 1
of 1
single 1
drops 1
of 1
water 1
continually 1
falling 1
on 1
the 1
head 1
Every 1
thought 1
that 1
was 1
devoted 1
to 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
extreme 1
anguish 1
and 1
every 1
word 1
that 1
I 1
spoke 1
in 1
allusion 1
to 1
it 1
caused 1
my 1
lips 1
to 1
quiver 1
and 1
my 1
heart 1
to 1
palpitate 1
After 1
passing 1
some 1
months 1
in 1
London 1
we 1
received 1
a 1
letter 1
from 1
a 1
person 1
in 1
Scotland 1
who 1
had 1
formerly 1
been 1
our 1
visitor 1
at 1
Geneva 1
He 1
mentioned 1
the 1
beauties 1
of 1
his 1
native 1
country 1
and 1
asked 1
us 1
if 1
those 1
were 1
not 1
sufficient 1
allurements 1
to 1
induce 1
us 1
to 1
prolong 1
our 1
journey 1
as 1
far 1
north 1
as 1
Perth 1
where 1
he 1
resided 1
Clerval 1
eagerly 1
desired 1
to 1
accept 1
this 1
invitation 1
and 1
I 1
although 1
I 1
abhorred 1
society 1
wished 1
to 1
view 1
again 1
mountains 1
and 1
streams 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
wondrous 1
works 1
with 1
which 1
Nature 1
adorns 1
her 1
chosen 1
dwelling 1
places 1
We 1
had 1
arrived 1
in 1
England 1
at 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
October 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
now 1
February 1
We 1
accordingly 1
determined 1
to 1
commence 1
our 1
journey 1
towards 1
the 1
north 1
at 1
the 1
expiration 1
of 1
another 1
month 1
In 1
this 1
expedition 1
we 1
did 1
not 1
intend 1
to 1
follow 1
the 1
great 1
road 1
to 1
Edinburgh 1
but 1
to 1
visit 1
Windsor 1
Oxford 1
Matlock 1
and 1
the 1
Cumberland 1
lakes 1
resolving 1
to 1
arrive 1
at 1
the 1
completion 1
of 1
this 1
tour 1
about 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
July 1
I 1
packed 1
up 1
my 1
chemical 1
instruments 1
and 1
the 1
materials 1
I 1
had 1
collected 1
resolving 1
to 1
finish 1
my 1
labours 1
in 1
some 1
obscure 1
nook 1
in 1
the 1
northern 1
highlands 1
of 1
Scotland 1
We 1
quitted 1
London 1
on 1
the 1
th 1
of 1
March 1
and 1
remained 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
at 1
Windsor 1
rambling 1
in 1
its 1
beautiful 1
forest 1
This 1
was 1
a 1
new 1
scene 1
to 1
us 1
mountaineers 1
the 1
majestic 1
oaks 1
the 1
quantity 1
of 1
game 1
and 1
the 1
herds 1
of 1
stately 1
deer 1
were 1
all 1
novelties 1
to 1
us 1
From 1
thence 1
we 1
proceeded 1
to 1
Oxford 1
As 1
we 1
entered 1
this 1
city 1
our 1
minds 1
were 1
filled 1
with 1
the 1
remembrance 1
of 1
the 1
events 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
transacted 1
there 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
century 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
before 1
It 1
was 1
here 1
that 1
Charles 1
I 1
had 1
collected 1
his 1
forces 1
This 1
city 1
had 1
remained 1
faithful 1
to 1
him 1
after 1
the 1
whole 1
nation 1
had 1
forsaken 1
his 1
cause 1
to 1
join 1
the 1
standard 1
of 1
Parliament 1
and 1
liberty 1
The 1
memory 1
of 1
that 1
unfortunate 1
king 1
and 1
his 1
companions 1
the 1
amiable 1
Falkland 1
the 1
insolent 1
Goring 1
his 1
queen 1
and 1
son 1
gave 1
a 1
peculiar 1
interest 1
to 1
every 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
which 1
they 1
might 1
be 1
supposed 1
to 1
have 1
inhabited 1
The 1
spirit 1
of 1
elder 1
days 1
found 1
a 1
dwelling 1
here 1
and 1
we 1
delighted 1
to 1
trace 1
its 1
footsteps 1
If 1
these 1
feelings 1
had 1
not 1
found 1
an 1
imaginary 1
gratification 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
had 1
yet 1
in 1
itself 1
sufficient 1
beauty 1
to 1
obtain 1
our 1
admiration 1
The 1
colleges 1
are 1
ancient 1
and 1
picturesque 1
the 1
streets 1
are 1
almost 1
magnificent 1
and 1
the 1
lovely 1
Isis 1
which 1
flows 1
beside 1
it 1
through 1
meadows 1
of 1
exquisite 1
verdure 1
is 1
spread 1
forth 1
into 1
a 1
placid 1
expanse 1
of 1
waters 1
which 1
reflects 1
its 1
majestic 1
assemblage 1
of 1
towers 1
and 1
spires 1
and 1
domes 1
embosomed 1
among 1
aged 1
trees 1
I 1
enjoyed 1
this 1
scene 1
and 1
yet 1
my 1
enjoyment 1
was 1
embittered 1
both 1
by 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
past 1
and 1
the 1
anticipation 1
of 1
the 1
future 1
I 1
was 1
formed 1
for 1
peaceful 1
happiness 1
During 1
my 1
youthful 1
days 1
discontent 1
never 1
visited 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
if 1
I 1
was 1
ever 1
overcome 1
by 1
ennui 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
what 1
is 1
beautiful 1
in 1
nature 1
or 1
the 1
study 1
of 1
what 1
is 1
excellent 1
and 1
sublime 1
in 1
the 1
productions 1
of 1
man 1
could 1
always 1
interest 1
my 1
heart 1
and 1
communicate 1
elasticity 1
to 1
my 1
spirits 1
But 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
blasted 1
tree 1
the 1
bolt 1
has 1
entered 1
my 1
soul 1
and 1
I 1
felt 1
then 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
survive 1
to 1
exhibit 1
what 1
I 1
shall 1
soon 1
cease 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
miserable 1
spectacle 1
of 1
wrecked 1
humanity 1
pitiable 1
to 1
others 1
and 1
intolerable 1
to 1
myself 1
We 1
passed 1
a 1
considerable 1
period 1
at 1
Oxford 1
rambling 1
among 1
its 1
environs 1
and 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
identify 1
every 1
spot 1
which 1
might 1
relate 1
to 1
the 1
most 1
animating 1
epoch 1
of 1
English 1
history 1
Our 1
little 1
voyages 1
of 1
discovery 1
were 1
often 1
prolonged 1
by 1
the 1
successive 1
objects 1
that 1
presented 1
themselves 1
We 1
visited 1
the 1
tomb 1
of 1
the 1
illustrious 1
Hampden 1
and 1
the 1
field 1
on 1
which 1
that 1
patriot 1
fell 1
For 1
a 1
moment 1
my 1
soul 1
was 1
elevated 1
from 1
its 1
debasing 1
and 1
miserable 1
fears 1
to 1
contemplate 1
the 1
divine 1
ideas 1
of 1
liberty 1
and 1
self 1
sacrifice 1
of 1
which 1
these 1
sights 1
were 1
the 1
monuments 1
and 1
the 1
remembrancers 1
For 1
an 1
instant 1
I 1
dared 1
to 1
shake 1
off 1
my 1
chains 1
and 1
look 1
around 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
free 1
and 1
lofty 1
spirit 1
but 1
the 1
iron 1
had 1
eaten 1
into 1
my 1
flesh 1
and 1
I 1
sank 1
again 1
trembling 1
and 1
hopeless 1
into 1
my 1
miserable 1
self 1
We 1
left 1
Oxford 1
with 1
regret 1
and 1
proceeded 1
to 1
Matlock 1
which 1
was 1
our 1
next 1
place 1
of 1
rest 1
The 1
country 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
this 1
village 1
resembled 1
to 1
a 1
greater 1
degree 1
the 1
scenery 1
of 1
Switzerland 1
but 1
everything 1
is 1
on 1
a 1
lower 1
scale 1
and 1
the 1
green 1
hills 1
want 1
the 1
crown 1
of 1
distant 1
white 1
Alps 1
which 1
always 1
attend 1
on 1
the 1
piny 1
mountains 1
of 1
my 1
native 1
country 1
We 1
visited 1
the 1
wondrous 1
cave 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
cabinets 1
of 1
natural 1
history 1
where 1
the 1
curiosities 1
are 1
disposed 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
manner 1
as 1
in 1
the 1
collections 1
at 1
Servox 1
and 1
Chamounix 1
The 1
latter 1
name 1
made 1
me 1
tremble 1
when 1
pronounced 1
by 1
Henry 1
and 1
I 1
hastened 1
to 1
quit 1
Matlock 1
with 1
which 1
that 1
terrible 1
scene 1
was 1
thus 1
associated 1
From 1
Derby 1
still 1
journeying 1
northwards 1
we 1
passed 1
two 1
months 1
in 1
Cumberland 1
and 1
Westmorland 1
I 1
could 1
now 1
almost 1
fancy 1
myself 1
among 1
the 1
Swiss 1
mountains 1
The 1
little 1
patches 1
of 1
snow 1
which 1
yet 1
lingered 1
on 1
the 1
northern 1
sides 1
of 1
the 1
mountains 1
the 1
lakes 1
and 1
the 1
dashing 1
of 1
the 1
rocky 1
streams 1
were 1
all 1
familiar 1
and 1
dear 1
sights 1
to 1
me 1
Here 1
also 1
we 1
made 1
some 1
acquaintances 1
who 1
almost 1
contrived 1
to 1
cheat 1
me 1
into 1
happiness 1
The 1
delight 1
of 1
Clerval 1
was 1
proportionably 1
greater 1
than 1
mine 1
his 1
mind 1
expanded 1
in 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
men 1
of 1
talent 1
and 1
he 1
found 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
nature 1
greater 1
capacities 1
and 1
resources 1
than 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
imagined 1
himself 1
to 1
have 1
possessed 1
while 1
he 1
associated 1
with 1
his 1
inferiors 1
I 1
could 1
pass 1
my 1
life 1
here 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
among 1
these 1
mountains 1
I 1
should 1
scarcely 1
regret 1
Switzerland 1
and 1
the 1
Rhine 1
But 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
a 1
traveller 1
s 1
life 1
is 1
one 1
that 1
includes 1
much 1
pain 1
amidst 1
its 1
enjoyments 1
His 1
feelings 1
are 1
forever 1
on 1
the 1
stretch 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
begins 1
to 1
sink 1
into 1
repose 1
he 1
finds 1
himself 1
obliged 1
to 1
quit 1
that 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
rests 1
in 1
pleasure 1
for 1
something 1
new 1
which 1
again 1
engages 1
his 1
attention 1
and 1
which 1
also 1
he 1
forsakes 1
for 1
other 1
novelties 1
We 1
had 1
scarcely 1
visited 1
the 1
various 1
lakes 1
of 1
Cumberland 1
and 1
Westmorland 1
and 1
conceived 1
an 1
affection 1
for 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
when 1
the 1
period 1
of 1
our 1
appointment 1
with 1
our 1
Scotch 1
friend 1
approached 1
and 1
we 1
left 1
them 1
to 1
travel 1
on 1
For 1
my 1
own 1
part 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
sorry 1
I 1
had 1
now 1
neglected 1
my 1
promise 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
and 1
I 1
feared 1
the 1
effects 1
of 1
the 1
daemon 1
s 1
disappointment 1
He 1
might 1
remain 1
in 1
Switzerland 1
and 1
wreak 1
his 1
vengeance 1
on 1
my 1
relatives 1
This 1
idea 1
pursued 1
me 1
and 1
tormented 1
me 1
at 1
every 1
moment 1
from 1
which 1
I 1
might 1
otherwise 1
have 1
snatched 1
repose 1
and 1
peace 1
I 1
waited 1
for 1
my 1
letters 1
with 1
feverish 1
impatience 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
delayed 1
I 1
was 1
miserable 1
and 1
overcome 1
by 1
a 1
thousand 1
fears 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
arrived 1
and 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
superscription 1
of 1
Elizabeth 1
or 1
my 1
father 1
I 1
hardly 1
dared 1
to 1
read 1
and 1
ascertain 1
my 1
fate 1
Sometimes 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
the 1
fiend 1
followed 1
me 1
and 1
might 1
expedite 1
my 1
remissness 1
by 1
murdering 1
my 1
companion 1
When 1
these 1
thoughts 1
possessed 1
me 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
quit 1
Henry 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
but 1
followed 1
him 1
as 1
his 1
shadow 1
to 1
protect 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
fancied 1
rage 1
of 1
his 1
destroyer 1
I 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
committed 1
some 1
great 1
crime 1
the 1
consciousness 1
of 1
which 1
haunted 1
me 1
I 1
was 1
guiltless 1
but 1
I 1
had 1
indeed 1
drawn 1
down 1
a 1
horrible 1
curse 1
upon 1
my 1
head 1
as 1
mortal 1
as 1
that 1
of 1
crime 1
I 1
visited 1
Edinburgh 1
with 1
languid 1
eyes 1
and 1
mind 1
and 1
yet 1
that 1
city 1
might 1
have 1
interested 1
the 1
most 1
unfortunate 1
being 1
Clerval 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
it 1
so 1
well 1
as 1
Oxford 1
for 1
the 1
antiquity 1
of 1
the 1
latter 1
city 1
was 1
more 1
pleasing 1
to 1
him 1
But 1
the 1
beauty 1
and 1
regularity 1
of 1
the 1
new 1
town 1
of 1
Edinburgh 1
its 1
romantic 1
castle 1
and 1
its 1
environs 1
the 1
most 1
delightful 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
Arthur 1
s 1
Seat 1
St 1
Bernard 1
s 1
Well 1
and 1
the 1
Pentland 1
Hills 1
compensated 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
change 1
and 1
filled 1
him 1
with 1
cheerfulness 1
and 1
admiration 1
But 1
I 1
was 1
impatient 1
to 1
arrive 1
at 1
the 1
termination 1
of 1
my 1
journey 1
We 1
left 1
Edinburgh 1
in 1
a 1
week 1
passing 1
through 1
Coupar 1
St 1
Andrew 1
s 1
and 1
along 1
the 1
banks 1
of 1
the 1
Tay 1
to 1
Perth 1
where 1
our 1
friend 1
expected 1
us 1
But 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
no 1
mood 1
to 1
laugh 1
and 1
talk 1
with 1
strangers 1
or 1
enter 1
into 1
their 1
feelings 1
or 1
plans 1
with 1
the 1
good 1
humour 1
expected 1
from 1
a 1
guest 1
and 1
accordingly 1
I 1
told 1
Clerval 1
that 1
I 1
wished 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
tour 1
of 1
Scotland 1
alone 1
Do 1
you 1
said 1
I 1
enjoy 1
yourself 1
and 1
let 1
this 1
be 1
our 1
rendezvous 1
I 1
may 1
be 1
absent 1
a 1
month 1
or 1
two 1
but 1
do 1
not 1
interfere 1
with 1
my 1
motions 1
I 1
entreat 1
you 1
leave 1
me 1
to 1
peace 1
and 1
solitude 1
for 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
return 1
I 1
hope 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
with 1
a 1
lighter 1
heart 1
more 1
congenial 1
to 1
your 1
own 1
temper 1
Henry 1
wished 1
to 1
dissuade 1
me 1
but 1
seeing 1
me 1
bent 1
on 1
this 1
plan 1
ceased 1
to 1
remonstrate 1
He 1
entreated 1
me 1
to 1
write 1
often 1
I 1
had 1
rather 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
he 1
said 1
in 1
your 1
solitary 1
rambles 1
than 1
with 1
these 1
Scotch 1
people 1
whom 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
hasten 1
then 1
my 1
dear 1
friend 1
to 1
return 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
again 1
feel 1
myself 1
somewhat 1
at 1
home 1
which 1
I 1
cannot 1
do 1
in 1
your 1
absence 1
Having 1
parted 1
from 1
my 1
friend 1
I 1
determined 1
to 1
visit 1
some 1
remote 1
spot 1
of 1
Scotland 1
and 1
finish 1
my 1
work 1
in 1
solitude 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
doubt 1
but 1
that 1
the 1
monster 1
followed 1
me 1
and 1
would 1
discover 1
himself 1
to 1
me 1
when 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
finished 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
receive 1
his 1
companion 1
With 1
this 1
resolution 1
I 1
traversed 1
the 1
northern 1
highlands 1
and 1
fixed 1
on 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
remotest 1
of 1
the 1
Orkneys 1
as 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
my 1
labours 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
place 1
fitted 1
for 1
such 1
a 1
work 1
being 1
hardly 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
rock 1
whose 1
high 1
sides 1
were 1
continually 1
beaten 1
upon 1
by 1
the 1
waves 1
The 1
soil 1
was 1
barren 1
scarcely 1
affording 1
pasture 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
miserable 1
cows 1
and 1
oatmeal 1
for 1
its 1
inhabitants 1
which 1
consisted 1
of 1
five 1
persons 1
whose 1
gaunt 1
and 1
scraggy 1
limbs 1
gave 1
tokens 1
of 1
their 1
miserable 1
fare 1
Vegetables 1
and 1
bread 1
when 1
they 1
indulged 1
in 1
such 1
luxuries 1
and 1
even 1
fresh 1
water 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
procured 1
from 1
the 1
mainland 1
which 1
was 1
about 1
five 1
miles 1
distant 1
On 1
the 1
whole 1
island 1
there 1
were 1
but 1
three 1
miserable 1
huts 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
was 1
vacant 1
when 1
I 1
arrived 1
This 1
I 1
hired 1
It 1
contained 1
but 1
two 1
rooms 1
and 1
these 1
exhibited 1
all 1
the 1
squalidness 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
miserable 1
penury 1
The 1
thatch 1
had 1
fallen 1
in 1
the 1
walls 1
were 1
unplastered 1
and 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
off 1
its 1
hinges 1
I 1
ordered 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
repaired 1
bought 1
some 1
furniture 1
and 1
took 1
possession 1
an 1
incident 1
which 1
would 1
doubtless 1
have 1
occasioned 1
some 1
surprise 1
had 1
not 1
all 1
the 1
senses 1
of 1
the 1
cottagers 1
been 1
benumbed 1
by 1
want 1
and 1
squalid 1
poverty 1
As 1
it 1
was 1
I 1
lived 1
ungazed 1
at 1
and 1
unmolested 1
hardly 1
thanked 1
for 1
the 1
pittance 1
of 1
food 1
and 1
clothes 1
which 1
I 1
gave 1
so 1
much 1
does 1
suffering 1
blunt 1
even 1
the 1
coarsest 1
sensations 1
of 1
men 1
In 1
this 1
retreat 1
I 1
devoted 1
the 1
morning 1
to 1
labour 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
when 1
the 1
weather 1
permitted 1
I 1
walked 1
on 1
the 1
stony 1
beach 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
to 1
listen 1
to 1
the 1
waves 1
as 1
they 1
roared 1
and 1
dashed 1
at 1
my 1
feet 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
monotonous 1
yet 1
ever 1
changing 1
scene 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
Switzerland 1
it 1
was 1
far 1
different 1
from 1
this 1
desolate 1
and 1
appalling 1
landscape 1
Its 1
hills 1
are 1
covered 1
with 1
vines 1
and 1
its 1
cottages 1
are 1
scattered 1
thickly 1
in 1
the 1
plains 1
Its 1
fair 1
lakes 1
reflect 1
a 1
blue 1
and 1
gentle 1
sky 1
and 1
when 1
troubled 1
by 1
the 1
winds 1
their 1
tumult 1
is 1
but 1
as 1
the 1
play 1
of 1
a 1
lively 1
infant 1
when 1
compared 1
to 1
the 1
roarings 1
of 1
the 1
giant 1
ocean 1
In 1
this 1
manner 1
I 1
distributed 1
my 1
occupations 1
when 1
I 1
first 1
arrived 1
but 1
as 1
I 1
proceeded 1
in 1
my 1
labour 1
it 1
became 1
every 1
day 1
more 1
horrible 1
and 1
irksome 1
to 1
me 1
Sometimes 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
prevail 1
on 1
myself 1
to 1
enter 1
my 1
laboratory 1
for 1
several 1
days 1
and 1
at 1
other 1
times 1
I 1
toiled 1
day 1
and 1
night 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
complete 1
my 1
work 1
It 1
was 1
indeed 1
a 1
filthy 1
process 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
engaged 1
During 1
my 1
first 1
experiment 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
enthusiastic 1
frenzy 1
had 1
blinded 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
my 1
employment 1
my 1
mind 1
was 1
intently 1
fixed 1
on 1
the 1
consummation 1
of 1
my 1
labour 1
and 1
my 1
eyes 1
were 1
shut 1
to 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
my 1
proceedings 1
But 1
now 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
it 1
in 1
cold 1
blood 1
and 1
my 1
heart 1
often 1
sickened 1
at 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
my 1
hands 1
Thus 1
situated 1
employed 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
detestable 1
occupation 1
immersed 1
in 1
a 1
solitude 1
where 1
nothing 1
could 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
call 1
my 1
attention 1
from 1
the 1
actual 1
scene 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
engaged 1
my 1
spirits 1
became 1
unequal 1
I 1
grew 1
restless 1
and 1
nervous 1
Every 1
moment 1
I 1
feared 1
to 1
meet 1
my 1
persecutor 1
Sometimes 1
I 1
sat 1
with 1
my 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
fearing 1
to 1
raise 1
them 1
lest 1
they 1
should 1
encounter 1
the 1
object 1
which 1
I 1
so 1
much 1
dreaded 1
to 1
behold 1
I 1
feared 1
to 1
wander 1
from 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
lest 1
when 1
alone 1
he 1
should 1
come 1
to 1
claim 1
his 1
companion 1
In 1
the 1
mean 1
time 1
I 1
worked 1
on 1
and 1
my 1
labour 1
was 1
already 1
considerably 1
advanced 1
I 1
looked 1
towards 1
its 1
completion 1
with 1
a 1
tremulous 1
and 1
eager 1
hope 1
which 1
I 1
dared 1
not 1
trust 1
myself 1
to 1
question 1
but 1
which 1
was 1
intermixed 1
with 1
obscure 1
forebodings 1
of 1
evil 1
that 1
made 1
my 1
heart 1
sicken 1
in 1
my 1
bosom 1
Chapter 1
I 1
sat 1
one 1
evening 1
in 1
my 1
laboratory 1
the 1
sun 1
had 1
set 1
and 1
the 1
moon 1
was 1
just 1
rising 1
from 1
the 1
sea 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
sufficient 1
light 1
for 1
my 1
employment 1
and 1
I 1
remained 1
idle 1
in 1
a 1
pause 1
of 1
consideration 1
of 1
whether 1
I 1
should 1
leave 1
my 1
labour 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
or 1
hasten 1
its 1
conclusion 1
by 1
an 1
unremitting 1
attention 1
to 1
it 1
As 1
I 1
sat 1
a 1
train 1
of 1
reflection 1
occurred 1
to 1
me 1
which 1
led 1
me 1
to 1
consider 1
the 1
effects 1
of 1
what 1
I 1
was 1
now 1
doing 1
Three 1
years 1
before 1
I 1
was 1
engaged 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
manner 1
and 1
had 1
created 1
a 1
fiend 1
whose 1
unparalleled 1
barbarity 1
had 1
desolated 1
my 1
heart 1
and 1
filled 1
it 1
forever 1
with 1
the 1
bitterest 1
remorse 1
I 1
was 1
now 1
about 1
to 1
form 1
another 1
being 1
of 1
whose 1
dispositions 1
I 1
was 1
alike 1
ignorant 1
she 1
might 1
become 1
ten 1
thousand 1
times 1
more 1
malignant 1
than 1
her 1
mate 1
and 1
delight 1
for 1
its 1
own 1
sake 1
in 1
murder 1
and 1
wretchedness 1
He 1
had 1
sworn 1
to 1
quit 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
man 1
and 1
hide 1
himself 1
in 1
deserts 1
but 1
she 1
had 1
not 1
and 1
she 1
who 1
in 1
all 1
probability 1
was 1
to 1
become 1
a 1
thinking 1
and 1
reasoning 1
animal 1
might 1
refuse 1
to 1
comply 1
with 1
a 1
compact 1
made 1
before 1
her 1
creation 1
They 1
might 1
even 1
hate 1
each 1
other 1
the 1
creature 1
who 1
already 1
lived 1
loathed 1
his 1
own 1
deformity 1
and 1
might 1
he 1
not 1
conceive 1
a 1
greater 1
abhorrence 1
for 1
it 1
when 1
it 1
came 1
before 1
his 1
eyes 1
in 1
the 1
female 1
form 1
She 1
also 1
might 1
turn 1
with 1
disgust 1
from 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
superior 1
beauty 1
of 1
man 1
she 1
might 1
quit 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
be 1
again 1
alone 1
exasperated 1
by 1
the 1
fresh 1
provocation 1
of 1
being 1
deserted 1
by 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
species 1
Even 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
to 1
leave 1
Europe 1
and 1
inhabit 1
the 1
deserts 1
of 1
the 1
new 1
world 1
yet 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
results 1
of 1
those 1
sympathies 1
for 1
which 1
the 1
daemon 1
thirsted 1
would 1
be 1
children 1
and 1
a 1
race 1
of 1
devils 1
would 1
be 1
propagated 1
upon 1
the 1
earth 1
who 1
might 1
make 1
the 1
very 1
existence 1
of 1
the 1
species 1
of 1
man 1
a 1
condition 1
precarious 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
terror 1
Had 1
I 1
right 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
benefit 1
to 1
inflict 1
this 1
curse 1
upon 1
everlasting 1
generations 1
I 1
had 1
before 1
been 1
moved 1
by 1
the 1
sophisms 1
of 1
the 1
being 1
I 1
had 1
created 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
struck 1
senseless 1
by 1
his 1
fiendish 1
threats 1
but 1
now 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
the 1
wickedness 1
of 1
my 1
promise 1
burst 1
upon 1
me 1
I 1
shuddered 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
future 1
ages 1
might 1
curse 1
me 1
as 1
their 1
pest 1
whose 1
selfishness 1
had 1
not 1
hesitated 1
to 1
buy 1
its 1
own 1
peace 1
at 1
the 1
price 1
perhaps 1
of 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
human 1
race 1
I 1
trembled 1
and 1
my 1
heart 1
failed 1
within 1
me 1
when 1
on 1
looking 1
up 1
I 1
saw 1
by 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
moon 1
the 1
daemon 1
at 1
the 1
casement 1
A 1
ghastly 1
grin 1
wrinkled 1
his 1
lips 1
as 1
he 1
gazed 1
on 1
me 1
where 1
I 1
sat 1
fulfilling 1
the 1
task 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
allotted 1
to 1
me 1
Yes 1
he 1
had 1
followed 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
travels 1
he 1
had 1
loitered 1
in 1
forests 1
hid 1
himself 1
in 1
caves 1
or 1
taken 1
refuge 1
in 1
wide 1
and 1
desert 1
heaths 1
and 1
he 1
now 1
came 1
to 1
mark 1
my 1
progress 1
and 1
claim 1
the 1
fulfilment 1
of 1
my 1
promise 1
As 1
I 1
looked 1
on 1
him 1
his 1
countenance 1
expressed 1
the 1
utmost 1
extent 1
of 1
malice 1
and 1
treachery 1
I 1
thought 1
with 1
a 1
sensation 1
of 1
madness 1
on 1
my 1
promise 1
of 1
creating 1
another 1
like 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
trembling 1
with 1
passion 1
tore 1
to 1
pieces 1
the 1
thing 1
on 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
engaged 1
The 1
wretch 1
saw 1
me 1
destroy 1
the 1
creature 1
on 1
whose 1
future 1
existence 1
he 1
depended 1
for 1
happiness 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
howl 1
of 1
devilish 1
despair 1
and 1
revenge 1
withdrew 1
I 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
locking 1
the 1
door 1
made 1
a 1
solemn 1
vow 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
heart 1
never 1
to 1
resume 1
my 1
labours 1
and 1
then 1
with 1
trembling 1
steps 1
I 1
sought 1
my 1
own 1
apartment 1
I 1
was 1
alone 1
none 1
were 1
near 1
me 1
to 1
dissipate 1
the 1
gloom 1
and 1
relieve 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
sickening 1
oppression 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
terrible 1
reveries 1
Several 1
hours 1
passed 1
and 1
I 1
remained 1
near 1
my 1
window 1
gazing 1
on 1
the 1
sea 1
it 1
was 1
almost 1
motionless 1
for 1
the 1
winds 1
were 1
hushed 1
and 1
all 1
nature 1
reposed 1
under 1
the 1
eye 1
of 1
the 1
quiet 1
moon 1
A 1
few 1
fishing 1
vessels 1
alone 1
specked 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
gentle 1
breeze 1
wafted 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
voices 1
as 1
the 1
fishermen 1
called 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
I 1
felt 1
the 1
silence 1
although 1
I 1
was 1
hardly 1
conscious 1
of 1
its 1
extreme 1
profundity 1
until 1
my 1
ear 1
was 1
suddenly 1
arrested 1
by 1
the 1
paddling 1
of 1
oars 1
near 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
a 1
person 1
landed 1
close 1
to 1
my 1
house 1
In 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
after 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
creaking 1
of 1
my 1
door 1
as 1
if 1
some 1
one 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
open 1
it 1
softly 1
I 1
trembled 1
from 1
head 1
to 1
foot 1
I 1
felt 1
a 1
presentiment 1
of 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
and 1
wished 1
to 1
rouse 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
peasants 1
who 1
dwelt 1
in 1
a 1
cottage 1
not 1
far 1
from 1
mine 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
overcome 1
by 1
the 1
sensation 1
of 1
helplessness 1
so 1
often 1
felt 1
in 1
frightful 1
dreams 1
when 1
you 1
in 1
vain 1
endeavour 1
to 1
fly 1
from 1
an 1
impending 1
danger 1
and 1
was 1
rooted 1
to 1
the 1
spot 1
Presently 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
footsteps 1
along 1
the 1
passage 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
the 1
wretch 1
whom 1
I 1
dreaded 1
appeared 1
Shutting 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
approached 1
me 1
and 1
said 1
in 1
a 1
smothered 1
voice 1
You 1
have 1
destroyed 1
the 1
work 1
which 1
you 1
began 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
you 1
intend 1
Do 1
you 1
dare 1
to 1
break 1
your 1
promise 1
I 1
have 1
endured 1
toil 1
and 1
misery 1
I 1
left 1
Switzerland 1
with 1
you 1
I 1
crept 1
along 1
the 1
shores 1
of 1
the 1
Rhine 1
among 1
its 1
willow 1
islands 1
and 1
over 1
the 1
summits 1
of 1
its 1
hills 1
I 1
have 1
dwelt 1
many 1
months 1
in 1
the 1
heaths 1
of 1
England 1
and 1
among 1
the 1
deserts 1
of 1
Scotland 1
I 1
have 1
endured 1
incalculable 1
fatigue 1
and 1
cold 1
and 1
hunger 1
do 1
you 1
dare 1
destroy 1
my 1
hopes 1
Begone 1
I 1
do 1
break 1
my 1
promise 1
never 1
will 1
I 1
create 1
another 1
like 1
yourself 1
equal 1
in 1
deformity 1
and 1
wickedness 1
Slave 1
I 1
before 1
reasoned 1
with 1
you 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
proved 1
yourself 1
unworthy 1
of 1
my 1
condescension 1
Remember 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
power 1
you 1
believe 1
yourself 1
miserable 1
but 1
I 1
can 1
make 1
you 1
so 1
wretched 1
that 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
day 1
will 1
be 1
hateful 1
to 1
you 1
You 1
are 1
my 1
creator 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
your 1
master 1
obey 1
The 1
hour 1
of 1
my 1
irresolution 1
is 1
past 1
and 1
the 1
period 1
of 1
your 1
power 1
is 1
arrived 1
Your 1
threats 1
cannot 1
move 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
an 1
act 1
of 1
wickedness 1
but 1
they 1
confirm 1
me 1
in 1
a 1
determination 1
of 1
not 1
creating 1
you 1
a 1
companion 1
in 1
vice 1
Shall 1
I 1
in 1
cool 1
blood 1
set 1
loose 1
upon 1
the 1
earth 1
a 1
daemon 1
whose 1
delight 1
is 1
in 1
death 1
and 1
wretchedness 1
Begone 1
I 1
am 1
firm 1
and 1
your 1
words 1
will 1
only 1
exasperate 1
my 1
rage 1
The 1
monster 1
saw 1
my 1
determination 1
in 1
my 1
face 1
and 1
gnashed 1
his 1
teeth 1
in 1
the 1
impotence 1
of 1
anger 1
Shall 1
each 1
man 1
cried 1
he 1
find 1
a 1
wife 1
for 1
his 1
bosom 1
and 1
each 1
beast 1
have 1
his 1
mate 1
and 1
I 1
be 1
alone 1
I 1
had 1
feelings 1
of 1
affection 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
requited 1
by 1
detestation 1
and 1
scorn 1
Man 1
You 1
may 1
hate 1
but 1
beware 1
Your 1
hours 1
will 1
pass 1
in 1
dread 1
and 1
misery 1
and 1
soon 1
the 1
bolt 1
will 1
fall 1
which 1
must 1
ravish 1
from 1
you 1
your 1
happiness 1
forever 1
Are 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
happy 1
while 1
I 1
grovel 1
in 1
the 1
intensity 1
of 1
my 1
wretchedness 1
You 1
can 1
blast 1
my 1
other 1
passions 1
but 1
revenge 1
remains 1
revenge 1
henceforth 1
dearer 1
than 1
light 1
or 1
food 1
I 1
may 1
die 1
but 1
first 1
you 1
my 1
tyrant 1
and 1
tormentor 1
shall 1
curse 1
the 1
sun 1
that 1
gazes 1
on 1
your 1
misery 1
Beware 1
for 1
I 1
am 1
fearless 1
and 1
therefore 1
powerful 1
I 1
will 1
watch 1
with 1
the 1
wiliness 1
of 1
a 1
snake 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
sting 1
with 1
its 1
venom 1
Man 1
you 1
shall 1
repent 1
of 1
the 1
injuries 1
you 1
inflict 1
Devil 1
cease 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
poison 1
the 1
air 1
with 1
these 1
sounds 1
of 1
malice 1
I 1
have 1
declared 1
my 1
resolution 1
to 1
you 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
no 1
coward 1
to 1
bend 1
beneath 1
words 1
Leave 1
me 1
I 1
am 1
inexorable 1
It 1
is 1
well 1
I 1
go 1
but 1
remember 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
on 1
your 1
wedding 1
night 1
I 1
started 1
forward 1
and 1
exclaimed 1
Villain 1
Before 1
you 1
sign 1
my 1
death 1
warrant 1
be 1
sure 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
yourself 1
safe 1
I 1
would 1
have 1
seized 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
eluded 1
me 1
and 1
quitted 1
the 1
house 1
with 1
precipitation 1
In 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
I 1
saw 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
boat 1
which 1
shot 1
across 1
the 1
waters 1
with 1
an 1
arrowy 1
swiftness 1
and 1
was 1
soon 1
lost 1
amidst 1
the 1
waves 1
All 1
was 1
again 1
silent 1
but 1
his 1
words 1
rang 1
in 1
my 1
ears 1
I 1
burned 1
with 1
rage 1
to 1
pursue 1
the 1
murderer 1
of 1
my 1
peace 1
and 1
precipitate 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
ocean 1
I 1
walked 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
my 1
room 1
hastily 1
and 1
perturbed 1
while 1
my 1
imagination 1
conjured 1
up 1
a 1
thousand 1
images 1
to 1
torment 1
and 1
sting 1
me 1
Why 1
had 1
I 1
not 1
followed 1
him 1
and 1
closed 1
with 1
him 1
in 1
mortal 1
strife 1
But 1
I 1
had 1
suffered 1
him 1
to 1
depart 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
directed 1
his 1
course 1
towards 1
the 1
mainland 1
I 1
shuddered 1
to 1
think 1
who 1
might 1
be 1
the 1
next 1
victim 1
sacrificed 1
to 1
his 1
insatiate 1
revenge 1
And 1
then 1
I 1
thought 1
again 1
of 1
his 1
words 1
I 1
WILL 1
BE 1
WITH 1
YOU 1
ON 1
YOUR 1
WEDDING 1
NIGHT 1
That 1
then 1
was 1
the 1
period 1
fixed 1
for 1
the 1
fulfilment 1
of 1
my 1
destiny 1
In 1
that 1
hour 1
I 1
should 1
die 1
and 1
at 1
once 1
satisfy 1
and 1
extinguish 1
his 1
malice 1
The 1
prospect 1
did 1
not 1
move 1
me 1
to 1
fear 1
yet 1
when 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
my 1
beloved 1
Elizabeth 1
of 1
her 1
tears 1
and 1
endless 1
sorrow 1
when 1
she 1
should 1
find 1
her 1
lover 1
so 1
barbarously 1
snatched 1
from 1
her 1
tears 1
the 1
first 1
I 1
had 1
shed 1
for 1
many 1
months 1
streamed 1
from 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
I 1
resolved 1
not 1
to 1
fall 1
before 1
my 1
enemy 1
without 1
a 1
bitter 1
struggle 1
The 1
night 1
passed 1
away 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
rose 1
from 1
the 1
ocean 1
my 1
feelings 1
became 1
calmer 1
if 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
called 1
calmness 1
when 1
the 1
violence 1
of 1
rage 1
sinks 1
into 1
the 1
depths 1
of 1
despair 1
I 1
left 1
the 1
house 1
the 1
horrid 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
last 1
night 1
s 1
contention 1
and 1
walked 1
on 1
the 1
beach 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
which 1
I 1
almost 1
regarded 1
as 1
an 1
insuperable 1
barrier 1
between 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
nay 1
a 1
wish 1
that 1
such 1
should 1
prove 1
the 1
fact 1
stole 1
across 1
me 1
I 1
desired 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
pass 1
my 1
life 1
on 1
that 1
barren 1
rock 1
wearily 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
but 1
uninterrupted 1
by 1
any 1
sudden 1
shock 1
of 1
misery 1
If 1
I 1
returned 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
sacrificed 1
or 1
to 1
see 1
those 1
whom 1
I 1
most 1
loved 1
die 1
under 1
the 1
grasp 1
of 1
a 1
daemon 1
whom 1
I 1
had 1
myself 1
created 1
I 1
walked 1
about 1
the 1
isle 1
like 1
a 1
restless 1
spectre 1
separated 1
from 1
all 1
it 1
loved 1
and 1
miserable 1
in 1
the 1
separation 1
When 1
it 1
became 1
noon 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
rose 1
higher 1
I 1
lay 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
grass 1
and 1
was 1
overpowered 1
by 1
a 1
deep 1
sleep 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
awake 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
the 1
preceding 1
night 1
my 1
nerves 1
were 1
agitated 1
and 1
my 1
eyes 1
inflamed 1
by 1
watching 1
and 1
misery 1
The 1
sleep 1
into 1
which 1
I 1
now 1
sank 1
refreshed 1
me 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
awoke 1
I 1
again 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
I 1
belonged 1
to 1
a 1
race 1
of 1
human 1
beings 1
like 1
myself 1
and 1
I 1
began 1
to 1
reflect 1
upon 1
what 1
had 1
passed 1
with 1
greater 1
composure 1
yet 1
still 1
the 1
words 1
of 1
the 1
fiend 1
rang 1
in 1
my 1
ears 1
like 1
a 1
death 1
knell 1
they 1
appeared 1
like 1
a 1
dream 1
yet 1
distinct 1
and 1
oppressive 1
as 1
a 1
reality 1
The 1
sun 1
had 1
far 1
descended 1
and 1
I 1
still 1
sat 1
on 1
the 1
shore 1
satisfying 1
my 1
appetite 1
which 1
had 1
become 1
ravenous 1
with 1
an 1
oaten 1
cake 1
when 1
I 1
saw 1
a 1
fishing 1
boat 1
land 1
close 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
men 1
brought 1
me 1
a 1
packet 1
it 1
contained 1
letters 1
from 1
Geneva 1
and 1
one 1
from 1
Clerval 1
entreating 1
me 1
to 1
join 1
him 1
He 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
wearing 1
away 1
his 1
time 1
fruitlessly 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
that 1
letters 1
from 1
the 1
friends 1
he 1
had 1
formed 1
in 1
London 1
desired 1
his 1
return 1
to 1
complete 1
the 1
negotiation 1
they 1
had 1
entered 1
into 1
for 1
his 1
Indian 1
enterprise 1
He 1
could 1
not 1
any 1
longer 1
delay 1
his 1
departure 1
but 1
as 1
his 1
journey 1
to 1
London 1
might 1
be 1
followed 1
even 1
sooner 1
than 1
he 1
now 1
conjectured 1
by 1
his 1
longer 1
voyage 1
he 1
entreated 1
me 1
to 1
bestow 1
as 1
much 1
of 1
my 1
society 1
on 1
him 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
spare 1
He 1
besought 1
me 1
therefore 1
to 1
leave 1
my 1
solitary 1
isle 1
and 1
to 1
meet 1
him 1
at 1
Perth 1
that 1
we 1
might 1
proceed 1
southwards 1
together 1
This 1
letter 1
in 1
a 1
degree 1
recalled 1
me 1
to 1
life 1
and 1
I 1
determined 1
to 1
quit 1
my 1
island 1
at 1
the 1
expiration 1
of 1
two 1
days 1
Yet 1
before 1
I 1
departed 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
task 1
to 1
perform 1
on 1
which 1
I 1
shuddered 1
to 1
reflect 1
I 1
must 1
pack 1
up 1
my 1
chemical 1
instruments 1
and 1
for 1
that 1
purpose 1
I 1
must 1
enter 1
the 1
room 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
my 1
odious 1
work 1
and 1
I 1
must 1
handle 1
those 1
utensils 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
which 1
was 1
sickening 1
to 1
me 1
The 1
next 1
morning 1
at 1
daybreak 1
I 1
summoned 1
sufficient 1
courage 1
and 1
unlocked 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
my 1
laboratory 1
The 1
remains 1
of 1
the 1
half 1
finished 1
creature 1
whom 1
I 1
had 1
destroyed 1
lay 1
scattered 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
I 1
almost 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
mangled 1
the 1
living 1
flesh 1
of 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
I 1
paused 1
to 1
collect 1
myself 1
and 1
then 1
entered 1
the 1
chamber 1
With 1
trembling 1
hand 1
I 1
conveyed 1
the 1
instruments 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
but 1
I 1
reflected 1
that 1
I 1
ought 1
not 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
relics 1
of 1
my 1
work 1
to 1
excite 1
the 1
horror 1
and 1
suspicion 1
of 1
the 1
peasants 1
and 1
I 1
accordingly 1
put 1
them 1
into 1
a 1
basket 1
with 1
a 1
great 1
quantity 1
of 1
stones 1
and 1
laying 1
them 1
up 1
determined 1
to 1
throw 1
them 1
into 1
the 1
sea 1
that 1
very 1
night 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
I 1
sat 1
upon 1
the 1
beach 1
employed 1
in 1
cleaning 1
and 1
arranging 1
my 1
chemical 1
apparatus 1
Nothing 1
could 1
be 1
more 1
complete 1
than 1
the 1
alteration 1
that 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
in 1
my 1
feelings 1
since 1
the 1
night 1
of 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
the 1
daemon 1
I 1
had 1
before 1
regarded 1
my 1
promise 1
with 1
a 1
gloomy 1
despair 1
as 1
a 1
thing 1
that 1
with 1
whatever 1
consequences 1
must 1
be 1
fulfilled 1
but 1
I 1
now 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
a 1
film 1
had 1
been 1
taken 1
from 1
before 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
saw 1
clearly 1
The 1
idea 1
of 1
renewing 1
my 1
labours 1
did 1
not 1
for 1
one 1
instant 1
occur 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
threat 1
I 1
had 1
heard 1
weighed 1
on 1
my 1
thoughts 1
but 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
reflect 1
that 1
a 1
voluntary 1
act 1
of 1
mine 1
could 1
avert 1
it 1
I 1
had 1
resolved 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
mind 1
that 1
to 1
create 1
another 1
like 1
the 1
fiend 1
I 1
had 1
first 1
made 1
would 1
be 1
an 1
act 1
of 1
the 1
basest 1
and 1
most 1
atrocious 1
selfishness 1
and 1
I 1
banished 1
from 1
my 1
mind 1
every 1
thought 1
that 1
could 1
lead 1
to 1
a 1
different 1
conclusion 1
Between 1
two 1
and 1
three 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
the 1
moon 1
rose 1
and 1
I 1
then 1
putting 1
my 1
basket 1
aboard 1
a 1
little 1
skiff 1
sailed 1
out 1
about 1
four 1
miles 1
from 1
the 1
shore 1
The 1
scene 1
was 1
perfectly 1
solitary 1
a 1
few 1
boats 1
were 1
returning 1
towards 1
land 1
but 1
I 1
sailed 1
away 1
from 1
them 1
I 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
I 1
was 1
about 1
the 1
commission 1
of 1
a 1
dreadful 1
crime 1
and 1
avoided 1
with 1
shuddering 1
anxiety 1
any 1
encounter 1
with 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
At 1
one 1
time 1
the 1
moon 1
which 1
had 1
before 1
been 1
clear 1
was 1
suddenly 1
overspread 1
by 1
a 1
thick 1
cloud 1
and 1
I 1
took 1
advantage 1
of 1
the 1
moment 1
of 1
darkness 1
and 1
cast 1
my 1
basket 1
into 1
the 1
sea 1
I 1
listened 1
to 1
the 1
gurgling 1
sound 1
as 1
it 1
sank 1
and 1
then 1
sailed 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
spot 1
The 1
sky 1
became 1
clouded 1
but 1
the 1
air 1
was 1
pure 1
although 1
chilled 1
by 1
the 1
northeast 1
breeze 1
that 1
was 1
then 1
rising 1
But 1
it 1
refreshed 1
me 1
and 1
filled 1
me 1
with 1
such 1
agreeable 1
sensations 1
that 1
I 1
resolved 1
to 1
prolong 1
my 1
stay 1
on 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
fixing 1
the 1
rudder 1
in 1
a 1
direct 1
position 1
stretched 1
myself 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
boat 1
Clouds 1
hid 1
the 1
moon 1
everything 1
was 1
obscure 1
and 1
I 1
heard 1
only 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
boat 1
as 1
its 1
keel 1
cut 1
through 1
the 1
waves 1
the 1
murmur 1
lulled 1
me 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
I 1
slept 1
soundly 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
long 1
I 1
remained 1
in 1
this 1
situation 1
but 1
when 1
I 1
awoke 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
sun 1
had 1
already 1
mounted 1
considerably 1
The 1
wind 1
was 1
high 1
and 1
the 1
waves 1
continually 1
threatened 1
the 1
safety 1
of 1
my 1
little 1
skiff 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
wind 1
was 1
northeast 1
and 1
must 1
have 1
driven 1
me 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
coast 1
from 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
embarked 1
I 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
change 1
my 1
course 1
but 1
quickly 1
found 1
that 1
if 1
I 1
again 1
made 1
the 1
attempt 1
the 1
boat 1
would 1
be 1
instantly 1
filled 1
with 1
water 1
Thus 1
situated 1
my 1
only 1
resource 1
was 1
to 1
drive 1
before 1
the 1
wind 1
I 1
confess 1
that 1
I 1
felt 1
a 1
few 1
sensations 1
of 1
terror 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
compass 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
was 1
so 1
slenderly 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
geography 1
of 1
this 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
that 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
of 1
little 1
benefit 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
might 1
be 1
driven 1
into 1
the 1
wide 1
Atlantic 1
and 1
feel 1
all 1
the 1
tortures 1
of 1
starvation 1
or 1
be 1
swallowed 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
immeasurable 1
waters 1
that 1
roared 1
and 1
buffeted 1
around 1
me 1
I 1
had 1
already 1
been 1
out 1
many 1
hours 1
and 1
felt 1
the 1
torment 1
of 1
a 1
burning 1
thirst 1
a 1
prelude 1
to 1
my 1
other 1
sufferings 1
I 1
looked 1
on 1
the 1
heavens 1
which 1
were 1
covered 1
by 1
clouds 1
that 1
flew 1
before 1
the 1
wind 1
only 1
to 1
be 1
replaced 1
by 1
others 1
I 1
looked 1
upon 1
the 1
sea 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
my 1
grave 1
Fiend 1
I 1
exclaimed 1
your 1
task 1
is 1
already 1
fulfilled 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
Elizabeth 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
of 1
Clerval 1
all 1
left 1
behind 1
on 1
whom 1
the 1
monster 1
might 1
satisfy 1
his 1
sanguinary 1
and 1
merciless 1
passions 1
This 1
idea 1
plunged 1
me 1
into 1
a 1
reverie 1
so 1
despairing 1
and 1
frightful 1
that 1
even 1
now 1
when 1
the 1
scene 1
is 1
on 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
closing 1
before 1
me 1
forever 1
I 1
shudder 1
to 1
reflect 1
on 1
it 1
Some 1
hours 1
passed 1
thus 1
but 1
by 1
degrees 1
as 1
the 1
sun 1
declined 1
towards 1
the 1
horizon 1
the 1
wind 1
died 1
away 1
into 1
a 1
gentle 1
breeze 1
and 1
the 1
sea 1
became 1
free 1
from 1
breakers 1
But 1
these 1
gave 1
place 1
to 1
a 1
heavy 1
swell 1
I 1
felt 1
sick 1
and 1
hardly 1
able 1
to 1
hold 1
the 1
rudder 1
when 1
suddenly 1
I 1
saw 1
a 1
line 1
of 1
high 1
land 1
towards 1
the 1
south 1
Almost 1
spent 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
by 1
fatigue 1
and 1
the 1
dreadful 1
suspense 1
I 1
endured 1
for 1
several 1
hours 1
this 1
sudden 1
certainty 1
of 1
life 1
rushed 1
like 1
a 1
flood 1
of 1
warm 1
joy 1
to 1
my 1
heart 1
and 1
tears 1
gushed 1
from 1
my 1
eyes 1
How 1
mutable 1
are 1
our 1
feelings 1
and 1
how 1
strange 1
is 1
that 1
clinging 1
love 1
we 1
have 1
of 1
life 1
even 1
in 1
the 1
excess 1
of 1
misery 1
I 1
constructed 1
another 1
sail 1
with 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
dress 1
and 1
eagerly 1
steered 1
my 1
course 1
towards 1
the 1
land 1
It 1
had 1
a 1
wild 1
and 1
rocky 1
appearance 1
but 1
as 1
I 1
approached 1
nearer 1
I 1
easily 1
perceived 1
the 1
traces 1
of 1
cultivation 1
I 1
saw 1
vessels 1
near 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
found 1
myself 1
suddenly 1
transported 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
civilized 1
man 1
I 1
carefully 1
traced 1
the 1
windings 1
of 1
the 1
land 1
and 1
hailed 1
a 1
steeple 1
which 1
I 1
at 1
length 1
saw 1
issuing 1
from 1
behind 1
a 1
small 1
promontory 1
As 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
extreme 1
debility 1
I 1
resolved 1
to 1
sail 1
directly 1
towards 1
the 1
town 1
as 1
a 1
place 1
where 1
I 1
could 1
most 1
easily 1
procure 1
nourishment 1
Fortunately 1
I 1
had 1
money 1
with 1
me 1
As 1
I 1
turned 1
the 1
promontory 1
I 1
perceived 1
a 1
small 1
neat 1
town 1
and 1
a 1
good 1
harbour 1
which 1
I 1
entered 1
my 1
heart 1
bounding 1
with 1
joy 1
at 1
my 1
unexpected 1
escape 1
As 1
I 1
was 1
occupied 1
in 1
fixing 1
the 1
boat 1
and 1
arranging 1
the 1
sails 1
several 1
people 1
crowded 1
towards 1
the 1
spot 1
They 1
seemed 1
much 1
surprised 1
at 1
my 1
appearance 1
but 1
instead 1
of 1
offering 1
me 1
any 1
assistance 1
whispered 1
together 1
with 1
gestures 1
that 1
at 1
any 1
other 1
time 1
might 1
have 1
produced 1
in 1
me 1
a 1
slight 1
sensation 1
of 1
alarm 1
As 1
it 1
was 1
I 1
merely 1
remarked 1
that 1
they 1
spoke 1
English 1
and 1
I 1
therefore 1
addressed 1
them 1
in 1
that 1
language 1
My 1
good 1
friends 1
said 1
I 1
will 1
you 1
be 1
so 1
kind 1
as 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
this 1
town 1
and 1
inform 1
me 1
where 1
I 1
am 1
You 1
will 1
know 1
that 1
soon 1
enough 1
replied 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
hoarse 1
voice 1
Maybe 1
you 1
are 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
place 1
that 1
will 1
not 1
prove 1
much 1
to 1
your 1
taste 1
but 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
consulted 1
as 1
to 1
your 1
quarters 1
I 1
promise 1
you 1
I 1
was 1
exceedingly 1
surprised 1
on 1
receiving 1
so 1
rude 1
an 1
answer 1
from 1
a 1
stranger 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
also 1
disconcerted 1
on 1
perceiving 1
the 1
frowning 1
and 1
angry 1
countenances 1
of 1
his 1
companions 1
Why 1
do 1
you 1
answer 1
me 1
so 1
roughly 1
I 1
replied 1
Surely 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
custom 1
of 1
Englishmen 1
to 1
receive 1
strangers 1
so 1
inhospitably 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
what 1
the 1
custom 1
of 1
the 1
English 1
may 1
be 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
custom 1
of 1
the 1
Irish 1
to 1
hate 1
villains 1
While 1
this 1
strange 1
dialogue 1
continued 1
I 1
perceived 1
the 1
crowd 1
rapidly 1
increase 1
Their 1
faces 1
expressed 1
a 1
mixture 1
of 1
curiosity 1
and 1
anger 1
which 1
annoyed 1
and 1
in 1
some 1
degree 1
alarmed 1
me 1
I 1
inquired 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
inn 1
but 1
no 1
one 1
replied 1
I 1
then 1
moved 1
forward 1
and 1
a 1
murmuring 1
sound 1
arose 1
from 1
the 1
crowd 1
as 1
they 1
followed 1
and 1
surrounded 1
me 1
when 1
an 1
ill 1
looking 1
man 1
approaching 1
tapped 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
shoulder 1
and 1
said 1
Come 1
sir 1
you 1
must 1
follow 1
me 1
to 1
Mr 1
Kirwin 1
s 1
to 1
give 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
yourself 1
Who 1
is 1
Mr 1
Kirwin 1
Why 1
am 1
I 1
to 1
give 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
myself 1
Is 1
not 1
this 1
a 1
free 1
country 1
Ay 1
sir 1
free 1
enough 1
for 1
honest 1
folks 1
Mr 1
Kirwin 1
is 1
a 1
magistrate 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
to 1
give 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
a 1
gentleman 1
who 1
was 1
found 1
murdered 1
here 1
last 1
night 1
This 1
answer 1
startled 1
me 1
but 1
I 1
presently 1
recovered 1
myself 1
I 1
was 1
innocent 1
that 1
could 1
easily 1
be 1
proved 1
accordingly 1
I 1
followed 1
my 1
conductor 1
in 1
silence 1
and 1
was 1
led 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
best 1
houses 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
I 1
was 1
ready 1
to 1
sink 1
from 1
fatigue 1
and 1
hunger 1
but 1
being 1
surrounded 1
by 1
a 1
crowd 1
I 1
thought 1
it 1
politic 1
to 1
rouse 1
all 1
my 1
strength 1
that 1
no 1
physical 1
debility 1
might 1
be 1
construed 1
into 1
apprehension 1
or 1
conscious 1
guilt 1
Little 1
did 1
I 1
then 1
expect 1
the 1
calamity 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
to 1
overwhelm 1
me 1
and 1
extinguish 1
in 1
horror 1
and 1
despair 1
all 1
fear 1
of 1
ignominy 1
or 1
death 1
I 1
must 1
pause 1
here 1
for 1
it 1
requires 1
all 1
my 1
fortitude 1
to 1
recall 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
frightful 1
events 1
which 1
I 1
am 1
about 1
to 1
relate 1
in 1
proper 1
detail 1
to 1
my 1
recollection 1
Chapter 1
I 1
was 1
soon 1
introduced 1
into 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
magistrate 1
an 1
old 1
benevolent 1
man 1
with 1
calm 1
and 1
mild 1
manners 1
He 1
looked 1
upon 1
me 1
however 1
with 1
some 1
degree 1
of 1
severity 1
and 1
then 1
turning 1
towards 1
my 1
conductors 1
he 1
asked 1
who 1
appeared 1
as 1
witnesses 1
on 1
this 1
occasion 1
About 1
half 1
a 1
dozen 1
men 1
came 1
forward 1
and 1
one 1
being 1
selected 1
by 1
the 1
magistrate 1
he 1
deposed 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
out 1
fishing 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
with 1
his 1
son 1
and 1
brother 1
in 1
law 1
Daniel 1
Nugent 1
when 1
about 1
ten 1
o 1
clock 1
they 1
observed 1
a 1
strong 1
northerly 1
blast 1
rising 1
and 1
they 1
accordingly 1
put 1
in 1
for 1
port 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
dark 1
night 1
as 1
the 1
moon 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
risen 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
land 1
at 1
the 1
harbour 1
but 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
accustomed 1
at 1
a 1
creek 1
about 1
two 1
miles 1
below 1
He 1
walked 1
on 1
first 1
carrying 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
fishing 1
tackle 1
and 1
his 1
companions 1
followed 1
him 1
at 1
some 1
distance 1
As 1
he 1
was 1
proceeding 1
along 1
the 1
sands 1
he 1
struck 1
his 1
foot 1
against 1
something 1
and 1
fell 1
at 1
his 1
length 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
His 1
companions 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
assist 1
him 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
their 1
lantern 1
they 1
found 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
fallen 1
on 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
to 1
all 1
appearance 1
dead 1
Their 1
first 1
supposition 1
was 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
corpse 1
of 1
some 1
person 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
drowned 1
and 1
was 1
thrown 1
on 1
shore 1
by 1
the 1
waves 1
but 1
on 1
examination 1
they 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
clothes 1
were 1
not 1
wet 1
and 1
even 1
that 1
the 1
body 1
was 1
not 1
then 1
cold 1
They 1
instantly 1
carried 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
cottage 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
near 1
the 1
spot 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
but 1
in 1
vain 1
to 1
restore 1
it 1
to 1
life 1
It 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
handsome 1
young 1
man 1
about 1
five 1
and 1
twenty 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
He 1
had 1
apparently 1
been 1
strangled 1
for 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
any 1
violence 1
except 1
the 1
black 1
mark 1
of 1
fingers 1
on 1
his 1
neck 1
The 1
first 1
part 1
of 1
this 1
deposition 1
did 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
interest 1
me 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
mark 1
of 1
the 1
fingers 1
was 1
mentioned 1
I 1
remembered 1
the 1
murder 1
of 1
my 1
brother 1
and 1
felt 1
myself 1
extremely 1
agitated 1
my 1
limbs 1
trembled 1
and 1
a 1
mist 1
came 1
over 1
my 1
eyes 1
which 1
obliged 1
me 1
to 1
lean 1
on 1
a 1
chair 1
for 1
support 1
The 1
magistrate 1
observed 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
keen 1
eye 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
drew 1
an 1
unfavourable 1
augury 1
from 1
my 1
manner 1
The 1
son 1
confirmed 1
his 1
father 1
s 1
account 1
but 1
when 1
Daniel 1
Nugent 1
was 1
called 1
he 1
swore 1
positively 1
that 1
just 1
before 1
the 1
fall 1
of 1
his 1
companion 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
boat 1
with 1
a 1
single 1
man 1
in 1
it 1
at 1
a 1
short 1
distance 1
from 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
judge 1
by 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
a 1
few 1
stars 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
boat 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
just 1
landed 1
A 1
woman 1
deposed 1
that 1
she 1
lived 1
near 1
the 1
beach 1
and 1
was 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
her 1
cottage 1
waiting 1
for 1
the 1
return 1
of 1
the 1
fishermen 1
about 1
an 1
hour 1
before 1
she 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
discovery 1
of 1
the 1
body 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
a 1
boat 1
with 1
only 1
one 1
man 1
in 1
it 1
push 1
off 1
from 1
that 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
shore 1
where 1
the 1
corpse 1
was 1
afterwards 1
found 1
Another 1
woman 1
confirmed 1
the 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
fishermen 1
having 1
brought 1
the 1
body 1
into 1
her 1
house 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
cold 1
They 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
a 1
bed 1
and 1
rubbed 1
it 1
and 1
Daniel 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
town 1
for 1
an 1
apothecary 1
but 1
life 1
was 1
quite 1
gone 1
Several 1
other 1
men 1
were 1
examined 1
concerning 1
my 1
landing 1
and 1
they 1
agreed 1
that 1
with 1
the 1
strong 1
north 1
wind 1
that 1
had 1
arisen 1
during 1
the 1
night 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
probable 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
beaten 1
about 1
for 1
many 1
hours 1
and 1
had 1
been 1
obliged 1
to 1
return 1
nearly 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
spot 1
from 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
departed 1
Besides 1
they 1
observed 1
that 1
it 1
appeared 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
brought 1
the 1
body 1
from 1
another 1
place 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
likely 1
that 1
as 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
appear 1
to 1
know 1
the 1
shore 1
I 1
might 1
have 1
put 1
into 1
the 1
harbour 1
ignorant 1
of 1
the 1
distance 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
of 1
from 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
I 1
had 1
deposited 1
the 1
corpse 1
Mr 1
Kirwin 1
on 1
hearing 1
this 1
evidence 1
desired 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
taken 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
the 1
body 1
lay 1
for 1
interment 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
observed 1
what 1
effect 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
it 1
would 1
produce 1
upon 1
me 1
This 1
idea 1
was 1
probably 1
suggested 1
by 1
the 1
extreme 1
agitation 1
I 1
had 1
exhibited 1
when 1
the 1
mode 1
of 1
the 1
murder 1
had 1
been 1
described 1
I 1
was 1
accordingly 1
conducted 1
by 1
the 1
magistrate 1
and 1
several 1
other 1
persons 1
to 1
the 1
inn 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
being 1
struck 1
by 1
the 1
strange 1
coincidences 1
that 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
during 1
this 1
eventful 1
night 1
but 1
knowing 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
conversing 1
with 1
several 1
persons 1
in 1
the 1
island 1
I 1
had 1
inhabited 1
about 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
the 1
body 1
had 1
been 1
found 1
I 1
was 1
perfectly 1
tranquil 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
consequences 1
of 1
the 1
affair 1
I 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
the 1
corpse 1
lay 1
and 1
was 1
led 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
coffin 1
How 1
can 1
I 1
describe 1
my 1
sensations 1
on 1
beholding 1
it 1
I 1
feel 1
yet 1
parched 1
with 1
horror 1
nor 1
can 1
I 1
reflect 1
on 1
that 1
terrible 1
moment 1
without 1
shuddering 1
and 1
agony 1
The 1
examination 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
magistrate 1
and 1
witnesses 1
passed 1
like 1
a 1
dream 1
from 1
my 1
memory 1
when 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
lifeless 1
form 1
of 1
Henry 1
Clerval 1
stretched 1
before 1
me 1
I 1
gasped 1
for 1
breath 1
and 1
throwing 1
myself 1
on 1
the 1
body 1
I 1
exclaimed 1
Have 1
my 1
murderous 1
machinations 1
deprived 1
you 1
also 1
my 1
dearest 1
Henry 1
of 1
life 1
Two 1
I 1
have 1
already 1
destroyed 1
other 1
victims 1
await 1
their 1
destiny 1
but 1
you 1
Clerval 1
my 1
friend 1
my 1
benefactor 1
The 1
human 1
frame 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
support 1
the 1
agonies 1
that 1
I 1
endured 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
carried 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
strong 1
convulsions 1
A 1
fever 1
succeeded 1
to 1
this 1
I 1
lay 1
for 1
two 1
months 1
on 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
death 1
my 1
ravings 1
as 1
I 1
afterwards 1
heard 1
were 1
frightful 1
I 1
called 1
myself 1
the 1
murderer 1
of 1
William 1
of 1
Justine 1
and 1
of 1
Clerval 1
Sometimes 1
I 1
entreated 1
my 1
attendants 1
to 1
assist 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
destruction 1
of 1
the 1
fiend 1
by 1
whom 1
I 1
was 1
tormented 1
and 1
at 1
others 1
I 1
felt 1
the 1
fingers 1
of 1
the 1
monster 1
already 1
grasping 1
my 1
neck 1
and 1
screamed 1
aloud 1
with 1
agony 1
and 1
terror 1
Fortunately 1
as 1
I 1
spoke 1
my 1
native 1
language 1
Mr 1
Kirwin 1
alone 1
understood 1
me 1
but 1
my 1
gestures 1
and 1
bitter 1
cries 1
were 1
sufficient 1
to 1
affright 1
the 1
other 1
witnesses 1
Why 1
did 1
I 1
not 1
die 1
More 1
miserable 1
than 1
man 1
ever 1
was 1
before 1
why 1
did 1
I 1
not 1
sink 1
into 1
forgetfulness 1
and 1
rest 1
Death 1
snatches 1
away 1
many 1
blooming 1
children 1
the 1
only 1
hopes 1
of 1
their 1
doting 1
parents 1
how 1
many 1
brides 1
and 1
youthful 1
lovers 1
have 1
been 1
one 1
day 1
in 1
the 1
bloom 1
of 1
health 1
and 1
hope 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
a 1
prey 1
for 1
worms 1
and 1
the 1
decay 1
of 1
the 1
tomb 1
Of 1
what 1
materials 1
was 1
I 1
made 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
thus 1
resist 1
so 1
many 1
shocks 1
which 1
like 1
the 1
turning 1
of 1
the 1
wheel 1
continually 1
renewed 1
the 1
torture 1
But 1
I 1
was 1
doomed 1
to 1
live 1
and 1
in 1
two 1
months 1
found 1
myself 1
as 1
awaking 1
from 1
a 1
dream 1
in 1
a 1
prison 1
stretched 1
on 1
a 1
wretched 1
bed 1
surrounded 1
by 1
jailers 1
turnkeys 1
bolts 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
miserable 1
apparatus 1
of 1
a 1
dungeon 1
It 1
was 1
morning 1
I 1
remember 1
when 1
I 1
thus 1
awoke 1
to 1
understanding 1
I 1
had 1
forgotten 1
the 1
particulars 1
of 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
and 1
only 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
some 1
great 1
misfortune 1
had 1
suddenly 1
overwhelmed 1
me 1
but 1
when 1
I 1
looked 1
around 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
barred 1
windows 1
and 1
the 1
squalidness 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
all 1
flashed 1
across 1
my 1
memory 1
and 1
I 1
groaned 1
bitterly 1
This 1
sound 1
disturbed 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
who 1
was 1
sleeping 1
in 1
a 1
chair 1
beside 1
me 1
She 1
was 1
a 1
hired 1
nurse 1
the 1
wife 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
turnkeys 1
and 1
her 1
countenance 1
expressed 1
all 1
those 1
bad 1
qualities 1
which 1
often 1
characterize 1
that 1
class 1
The 1
lines 1
of 1
her 1
face 1
were 1
hard 1
and 1
rude 1
like 1
that 1
of 1
persons 1
accustomed 1
to 1
see 1
without 1
sympathizing 1
in 1
sights 1
of 1
misery 1
Her 1
tone 1
expressed 1
her 1
entire 1
indifference 1
she 1
addressed 1
me 1
in 1
English 1
and 1
the 1
voice 1
struck 1
me 1
as 1
one 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
heard 1
during 1
my 1
sufferings 1
Are 1
you 1
better 1
now 1
sir 1
said 1
she 1
I 1
replied 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
language 1
with 1
a 1
feeble 1
voice 1
I 1
believe 1
I 1
am 1
but 1
if 1
it 1
be 1
all 1
true 1
if 1
indeed 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
dream 1
I 1
am 1
sorry 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
still 1
alive 1
to 1
feel 1
this 1
misery 1
and 1
horror 1
For 1
that 1
matter 1
replied 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
if 1
you 1
mean 1
about 1
the 1
gentleman 1
you 1
murdered 1
I 1
believe 1
that 1
it 1
were 1
better 1
for 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
dead 1
for 1
I 1
fancy 1
it 1
will 1
go 1
hard 1
with 1
you 1
However 1
that 1
s 1
none 1
of 1
my 1
business 1
I 1
am 1
sent 1
to 1
nurse 1
you 1
and 1
get 1
you 1
well 1
I 1
do 1
my 1
duty 1
with 1
a 1
safe 1
conscience 1
it 1
were 1
well 1
if 1
everybody 1
did 1
the 1
same 1
I 1
turned 1
with 1
loathing 1
from 1
the 1
woman 1
who 1
could 1
utter 1
so 1
unfeeling 1
a 1
speech 1
to 1
a 1
person 1
just 1
saved 1
on 1
the 1
very 1
edge 1
of 1
death 1
but 1
I 1
felt 1
languid 1
and 1
unable 1
to 1
reflect 1
on 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
passed 1
The 1
whole 1
series 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
dream 1
I 1
sometimes 1
doubted 1
if 1
indeed 1
it 1
were 1
all 1
true 1
for 1
it 1
never 1
presented 1
itself 1
to 1
my 1
mind 1
with 1
the 1
force 1
of 1
reality 1
As 1
the 1
images 1
that 1
floated 1
before 1
me 1
became 1
more 1
distinct 1
I 1
grew 1
feverish 1
a 1
darkness 1
pressed 1
around 1
me 1
no 1
one 1
was 1
near 1
me 1
who 1
soothed 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
gentle 1
voice 1
of 1
love 1
no 1
dear 1
hand 1
supported 1
me 1
The 1
physician 1
came 1
and 1
prescribed 1
medicines 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
prepared 1
them 1
for 1
me 1
but 1
utter 1
carelessness 1
was 1
visible 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
and 1
the 1
expression 1
of 1
brutality 1
was 1
strongly 1
marked 1
in 1
the 1
visage 1
of 1
the 1
second 1
Who 1
could 1
be 1
interested 1
in 1
the 1
fate 1
of 1
a 1
murderer 1
but 1
the 1
hangman 1
who 1
would 1
gain 1
his 1
fee 1
These 1
were 1
my 1
first 1
reflections 1
but 1
I 1
soon 1
learned 1
that 1
Mr 1
Kirwin 1
had 1
shown 1
me 1
extreme 1
kindness 1
He 1
had 1
caused 1
the 1
best 1
room 1
in 1
the 1
prison 1
to 1
be 1
prepared 1
for 1
me 1
wretched 1
indeed 1
was 1
the 1
best 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
who 1
had 1
provided 1
a 1
physician 1
and 1
a 1
nurse 1
It 1
is 1
true 1
he 1
seldom 1
came 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
for 1
although 1
he 1
ardently 1
desired 1
to 1
relieve 1
the 1
sufferings 1
of 1
every 1
human 1
creature 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
present 1
at 1
the 1
agonies 1
and 1
miserable 1
ravings 1
of 1
a 1
murderer 1
He 1
came 1
therefore 1
sometimes 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
neglected 1
but 1
his 1
visits 1
were 1
short 1
and 1
with 1
long 1
intervals 1
One 1
day 1
while 1
I 1
was 1
gradually 1
recovering 1
I 1
was 1
seated 1
in 1
a 1
chair 1
my 1
eyes 1
half 1
open 1
and 1
my 1
cheeks 1
livid 1
like 1
those 1
in 1
death 1
I 1
was 1
overcome 1
by 1
gloom 1
and 1
misery 1
and 1
often 1
reflected 1
I 1
had 1
better 1
seek 1
death 1
than 1
desire 1
to 1
remain 1
in 1
a 1
world 1
which 1
to 1
me 1
was 1
replete 1
with 1
wretchedness 1
At 1
one 1
time 1
I 1
considered 1
whether 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
declare 1
myself 1
guilty 1
and 1
suffer 1
the 1
penalty 1
of 1
the 1
law 1
less 1
innocent 1
than 1
poor 1
Justine 1
had 1
been 1
Such 1
were 1
my 1
thoughts 1
when 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
my 1
apartment 1
was 1
opened 1
and 1
Mr 1
Kirwin 1
entered 1
His 1
countenance 1
expressed 1
sympathy 1
and 1
compassion 1
he 1
drew 1
a 1
chair 1
close 1
to 1
mine 1
and 1
addressed 1
me 1
in 1
French 1
I 1
fear 1
that 1
this 1
place 1
is 1
very 1
shocking 1
to 1
you 1
can 1
I 1
do 1
anything 1
to 1
make 1
you 1
more 1
comfortable 1
I 1
thank 1
you 1
but 1
all 1
that 1
you 1
mention 1
is 1
nothing 1
to 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
earth 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
comfort 1
which 1
I 1
am 1
capable 1
of 1
receiving 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
sympathy 1
of 1
a 1
stranger 1
can 1
be 1
but 1
of 1
little 1
relief 1
to 1
one 1
borne 1
down 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
by 1
so 1
strange 1
a 1
misfortune 1
But 1
you 1
will 1
I 1
hope 1
soon 1
quit 1
this 1
melancholy 1
abode 1
for 1
doubtless 1
evidence 1
can 1
easily 1
be 1
brought 1
to 1
free 1
you 1
from 1
the 1
criminal 1
charge 1
That 1
is 1
my 1
least 1
concern 1
I 1
am 1
by 1
a 1
course 1
of 1
strange 1
events 1
become 1
the 1
most 1
miserable 1
of 1
mortals 1
Persecuted 1
and 1
tortured 1
as 1
I 1
am 1
and 1
have 1
been 1
can 1
death 1
be 1
any 1
evil 1
to 1
me 1
Nothing 1
indeed 1
could 1
be 1
more 1
unfortunate 1
and 1
agonizing 1
than 1
the 1
strange 1
chances 1
that 1
have 1
lately 1
occurred 1
You 1
were 1
thrown 1
by 1
some 1
surprising 1
accident 1
on 1
this 1
shore 1
renowned 1
for 1
its 1
hospitality 1
seized 1
immediately 1
and 1
charged 1
with 1
murder 1
The 1
first 1
sight 1
that 1
was 1
presented 1
to 1
your 1
eyes 1
was 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
your 1
friend 1
murdered 1
in 1
so 1
unaccountable 1
a 1
manner 1
and 1
placed 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
by 1
some 1
fiend 1
across 1
your 1
path 1
As 1
Mr 1
Kirwin 1
said 1
this 1
notwithstanding 1
the 1
agitation 1
I 1
endured 1
on 1
this 1
retrospect 1
of 1
my 1
sufferings 1
I 1
also 1
felt 1
considerable 1
surprise 1
at 1
the 1
knowledge 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
possess 1
concerning 1
me 1
I 1
suppose 1
some 1
astonishment 1
was 1
exhibited 1
in 1
my 1
countenance 1
for 1
Mr 1
Kirwin 1
hastened 1
to 1
say 1
Immediately 1
upon 1
your 1
being 1
taken 1
ill 1
all 1
the 1
papers 1
that 1
were 1
on 1
your 1
person 1
were 1
brought 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
examined 1
them 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
discover 1
some 1
trace 1
by 1
which 1
I 1
could 1
send 1
to 1
your 1
relations 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
your 1
misfortune 1
and 1
illness 1
I 1
found 1
several 1
letters 1
and 1
among 1
others 1
one 1
which 1
I 1
discovered 1
from 1
its 1
commencement 1
to 1
be 1
from 1
your 1
father 1
I 1
instantly 1
wrote 1
to 1
Geneva 1
nearly 1
two 1
months 1
have 1
elapsed 1
since 1
the 1
departure 1
of 1
my 1
letter 1
But 1
you 1
are 1
ill 1
even 1
now 1
you 1
tremble 1
you 1
are 1
unfit 1
for 1
agitation 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
This 1
suspense 1
is 1
a 1
thousand 1
times 1
worse 1
than 1
the 1
most 1
horrible 1
event 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
new 1
scene 1
of 1
death 1
has 1
been 1
acted 1
and 1
whose 1
murder 1
I 1
am 1
now 1
to 1
lament 1
Your 1
family 1
is 1
perfectly 1
well 1
said 1
Mr 1
Kirwin 1
with 1
gentleness 1
and 1
someone 1
a 1
friend 1
is 1
come 1
to 1
visit 1
you 1
I 1
know 1
not 1
by 1
what 1
chain 1
of 1
thought 1
the 1
idea 1
presented 1
itself 1
but 1
it 1
instantly 1
darted 1
into 1
my 1
mind 1
that 1
the 1
murderer 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
mock 1
at 1
my 1
misery 1
and 1
taunt 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
Clerval 1
as 1
a 1
new 1
incitement 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
comply 1
with 1
his 1
hellish 1
desires 1
I 1
put 1
my 1
hand 1
before 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
cried 1
out 1
in 1
agony 1
Oh 1
Take 1
him 1
away 1
I 1
cannot 1
see 1
him 1
for 1
God 1
s 1
sake 1
do 1
not 1
let 1
him 1
enter 1
Mr 1
Kirwin 1
regarded 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
troubled 1
countenance 1
He 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
regarding 1
my 1
exclamation 1
as 1
a 1
presumption 1
of 1
my 1
guilt 1
and 1
said 1
in 1
rather 1
a 1
severe 1
tone 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
thought 1
young 1
man 1
that 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
your 1
father 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
welcome 1
instead 1
of 1
inspiring 1
such 1
violent 1
repugnance 1
My 1
father 1
cried 1
I 1
while 1
every 1
feature 1
and 1
every 1
muscle 1
was 1
relaxed 1
from 1
anguish 1
to 1
pleasure 1
Is 1
my 1
father 1
indeed 1
come 1
How 1
kind 1
how 1
very 1
kind 1
But 1
where 1
is 1
he 1
why 1
does 1
he 1
not 1
hasten 1
to 1
me 1
My 1
change 1
of 1
manner 1
surprised 1
and 1
pleased 1
the 1
magistrate 1
perhaps 1
he 1
thought 1
that 1
my 1
former 1
exclamation 1
was 1
a 1
momentary 1
return 1
of 1
delirium 1
and 1
now 1
he 1
instantly 1
resumed 1
his 1
former 1
benevolence 1
He 1
rose 1
and 1
quitted 1
the 1
room 1
with 1
my 1
nurse 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
my 1
father 1
entered 1
it 1
Nothing 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
could 1
have 1
given 1
me 1
greater 1
pleasure 1
than 1
the 1
arrival 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
I 1
stretched 1
out 1
my 1
hand 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
cried 1
Are 1
you 1
then 1
safe 1
and 1
Elizabeth 1
and 1
Ernest 1
My 1
father 1
calmed 1
me 1
with 1
assurances 1
of 1
their 1
welfare 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
by 1
dwelling 1
on 1
these 1
subjects 1
so 1
interesting 1
to 1
my 1
heart 1
to 1
raise 1
my 1
desponding 1
spirits 1
but 1
he 1
soon 1
felt 1
that 1
a 1
prison 1
cannot 1
be 1
the 1
abode 1
of 1
cheerfulness 1
What 1
a 1
place 1
is 1
this 1
that 1
you 1
inhabit 1
my 1
son 1
said 1
he 1
looking 1
mournfully 1
at 1
the 1
barred 1
windows 1
and 1
wretched 1
appearance 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
You 1
travelled 1
to 1
seek 1
happiness 1
but 1
a 1
fatality 1
seems 1
to 1
pursue 1
you 1
And 1
poor 1
Clerval 1
The 1
name 1
of 1
my 1
unfortunate 1
and 1
murdered 1
friend 1
was 1
an 1
agitation 1
too 1
great 1
to 1
be 1
endured 1
in 1
my 1
weak 1
state 1
I 1
shed 1
tears 1
Alas 1
Yes 1
my 1
father 1
replied 1
I 1
some 1
destiny 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
horrible 1
kind 1
hangs 1
over 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
must 1
live 1
to 1
fulfil 1
it 1
or 1
surely 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
died 1
on 1
the 1
coffin 1
of 1
Henry 1
We 1
were 1
not 1
allowed 1
to 1
converse 1
for 1
any 1
length 1
of 1
time 1
for 1
the 1
precarious 1
state 1
of 1
my 1
health 1
rendered 1
every 1
precaution 1
necessary 1
that 1
could 1
ensure 1
tranquillity 1
Mr 1
Kirwin 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
insisted 1
that 1
my 1
strength 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
exhausted 1
by 1
too 1
much 1
exertion 1
But 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
was 1
to 1
me 1
like 1
that 1
of 1
my 1
good 1
angel 1
and 1
I 1
gradually 1
recovered 1
my 1
health 1
As 1
my 1
sickness 1
quitted 1
me 1
I 1
was 1
absorbed 1
by 1
a 1
gloomy 1
and 1
black 1
melancholy 1
that 1
nothing 1
could 1
dissipate 1
The 1
image 1
of 1
Clerval 1
was 1
forever 1
before 1
me 1
ghastly 1
and 1
murdered 1
More 1
than 1
once 1
the 1
agitation 1
into 1
which 1
these 1
reflections 1
threw 1
me 1
made 1
my 1
friends 1
dread 1
a 1
dangerous 1
relapse 1
Alas 1
Why 1
did 1
they 1
preserve 1
so 1
miserable 1
and 1
detested 1
a 1
life 1
It 1
was 1
surely 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
fulfil 1
my 1
destiny 1
which 1
is 1
now 1
drawing 1
to 1
a 1
close 1
Soon 1
oh 1
very 1
soon 1
will 1
death 1
extinguish 1
these 1
throbbings 1
and 1
relieve 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
mighty 1
weight 1
of 1
anguish 1
that 1
bears 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
dust 1
and 1
in 1
executing 1
the 1
award 1
of 1
justice 1
I 1
shall 1
also 1
sink 1
to 1
rest 1
Then 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
death 1
was 1
distant 1
although 1
the 1
wish 1
was 1
ever 1
present 1
to 1
my 1
thoughts 1
and 1
I 1
often 1
sat 1
for 1
hours 1
motionless 1
and 1
speechless 1
wishing 1
for 1
some 1
mighty 1
revolution 1
that 1
might 1
bury 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
destroyer 1
in 1
its 1
ruins 1
The 1
season 1
of 1
the 1
assizes 1
approached 1
I 1
had 1
already 1
been 1
three 1
months 1
in 1
prison 1
and 1
although 1
I 1
was 1
still 1
weak 1
and 1
in 1
continual 1
danger 1
of 1
a 1
relapse 1
I 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
travel 1
nearly 1
a 1
hundred 1
miles 1
to 1
the 1
country 1
town 1
where 1
the 1
court 1
was 1
held 1
Mr 1
Kirwin 1
charged 1
himself 1
with 1
every 1
care 1
of 1
collecting 1
witnesses 1
and 1
arranging 1
my 1
defence 1
I 1
was 1
spared 1
the 1
disgrace 1
of 1
appearing 1
publicly 1
as 1
a 1
criminal 1
as 1
the 1
case 1
was 1
not 1
brought 1
before 1
the 1
court 1
that 1
decides 1
on 1
life 1
and 1
death 1
The 1
grand 1
jury 1
rejected 1
the 1
bill 1
on 1
its 1
being 1
proved 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
Orkney 1
Islands 1
at 1
the 1
hour 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
my 1
friend 1
was 1
found 1
and 1
a 1
fortnight 1
after 1
my 1
removal 1
I 1
was 1
liberated 1
from 1
prison 1
My 1
father 1
was 1
enraptured 1
on 1
finding 1
me 1
freed 1
from 1
the 1
vexations 1
of 1
a 1
criminal 1
charge 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
again 1
allowed 1
to 1
breathe 1
the 1
fresh 1
atmosphere 1
and 1
permitted 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
my 1
native 1
country 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
participate 1
in 1
these 1
feelings 1
for 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
walls 1
of 1
a 1
dungeon 1
or 1
a 1
palace 1
were 1
alike 1
hateful 1
The 1
cup 1
of 1
life 1
was 1
poisoned 1
forever 1
and 1
although 1
the 1
sun 1
shone 1
upon 1
me 1
as 1
upon 1
the 1
happy 1
and 1
gay 1
of 1
heart 1
I 1
saw 1
around 1
me 1
nothing 1
but 1
a 1
dense 1
and 1
frightful 1
darkness 1
penetrated 1
by 1
no 1
light 1
but 1
the 1
glimmer 1
of 1
two 1
eyes 1
that 1
glared 1
upon 1
me 1
Sometimes 1
they 1
were 1
the 1
expressive 1
eyes 1
of 1
Henry 1
languishing 1
in 1
death 1
the 1
dark 1
orbs 1
nearly 1
covered 1
by 1
the 1
lids 1
and 1
the 1
long 1
black 1
lashes 1
that 1
fringed 1
them 1
sometimes 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
watery 1
clouded 1
eyes 1
of 1
the 1
monster 1
as 1
I 1
first 1
saw 1
them 1
in 1
my 1
chamber 1
at 1
Ingolstadt 1
My 1
father 1
tried 1
to 1
awaken 1
in 1
me 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
affection 1
He 1
talked 1
of 1
Geneva 1
which 1
I 1
should 1
soon 1
visit 1
of 1
Elizabeth 1
and 1
Ernest 1
but 1
these 1
words 1
only 1
drew 1
deep 1
groans 1
from 1
me 1
Sometimes 1
indeed 1
I 1
felt 1
a 1
wish 1
for 1
happiness 1
and 1
thought 1
with 1
melancholy 1
delight 1
of 1
my 1
beloved 1
cousin 1
or 1
longed 1
with 1
a 1
devouring 1
maladie 1
du 1
pays 1
to 1
see 1
once 1
more 1
the 1
blue 1
lake 1
and 1
rapid 1
Rhone 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
so 1
dear 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
early 1
childhood 1
but 1
my 1
general 1
state 1
of 1
feeling 1
was 1
a 1
torpor 1
in 1
which 1
a 1
prison 1
was 1
as 1
welcome 1
a 1
residence 1
as 1
the 1
divinest 1
scene 1
in 1
nature 1
and 1
these 1
fits 1
were 1
seldom 1
interrupted 1
but 1
by 1
paroxysms 1
of 1
anguish 1
and 1
despair 1
At 1
these 1
moments 1
I 1
often 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
put 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
the 1
existence 1
I 1
loathed 1
and 1
it 1
required 1
unceasing 1
attendance 1
and 1
vigilance 1
to 1
restrain 1
me 1
from 1
committing 1
some 1
dreadful 1
act 1
of 1
violence 1
Yet 1
one 1
duty 1
remained 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
recollection 1
of 1
which 1
finally 1
triumphed 1
over 1
my 1
selfish 1
despair 1
It 1
was 1
necessary 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
return 1
without 1
delay 1
to 1
Geneva 1
there 1
to 1
watch 1
over 1
the 1
lives 1
of 1
those 1
I 1
so 1
fondly 1
loved 1
and 1
to 1
lie 1
in 1
wait 1
for 1
the 1
murderer 1
that 1
if 1
any 1
chance 1
led 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
of 1
his 1
concealment 1
or 1
if 1
he 1
dared 1
again 1
to 1
blast 1
me 1
by 1
his 1
presence 1
I 1
might 1
with 1
unfailing 1
aim 1
put 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
the 1
monstrous 1
image 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
endued 1
with 1
the 1
mockery 1
of 1
a 1
soul 1
still 1
more 1
monstrous 1
My 1
father 1
still 1
desired 1
to 1
delay 1
our 1
departure 1
fearful 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
sustain 1
the 1
fatigues 1
of 1
a 1
journey 1
for 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
shattered 1
wreck 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
My 1
strength 1
was 1
gone 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
mere 1
skeleton 1
and 1
fever 1
night 1
and 1
day 1
preyed 1
upon 1
my 1
wasted 1
frame 1
Still 1
as 1
I 1
urged 1
our 1
leaving 1
Ireland 1
with 1
such 1
inquietude 1
and 1
impatience 1
my 1
father 1
thought 1
it 1
best 1
to 1
yield 1
We 1
took 1
our 1
passage 1
on 1
board 1
a 1
vessel 1
bound 1
for 1
Havre 1
de 1
Grace 1
and 1
sailed 1
with 1
a 1
fair 1
wind 1
from 1
the 1
Irish 1
shores 1
It 1
was 1
midnight 1
I 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
deck 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
stars 1
and 1
listening 1
to 1
the 1
dashing 1
of 1
the 1
waves 1
I 1
hailed 1
the 1
darkness 1
that 1
shut 1
Ireland 1
from 1
my 1
sight 1
and 1
my 1
pulse 1
beat 1
with 1
a 1
feverish 1
joy 1
when 1
I 1
reflected 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
soon 1
see 1
Geneva 1
The 1
past 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
a 1
frightful 1
dream 1
yet 1
the 1
vessel 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
the 1
wind 1
that 1
blew 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
detested 1
shore 1
of 1
Ireland 1
and 1
the 1
sea 1
which 1
surrounded 1
me 1
told 1
me 1
too 1
forcibly 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
deceived 1
by 1
no 1
vision 1
and 1
that 1
Clerval 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
dearest 1
companion 1
had 1
fallen 1
a 1
victim 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
monster 1
of 1
my 1
creation 1
I 1
repassed 1
in 1
my 1
memory 1
my 1
whole 1
life 1
my 1
quiet 1
happiness 1
while 1
residing 1
with 1
my 1
family 1
in 1
Geneva 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
my 1
departure 1
for 1
Ingolstadt 1
I 1
remembered 1
shuddering 1
the 1
mad 1
enthusiasm 1
that 1
hurried 1
me 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
creation 1
of 1
my 1
hideous 1
enemy 1
and 1
I 1
called 1
to 1
mind 1
the 1
night 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
first 1
lived 1
I 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
pursue 1
the 1
train 1
of 1
thought 1
a 1
thousand 1
feelings 1
pressed 1
upon 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
wept 1
bitterly 1
Ever 1
since 1
my 1
recovery 1
from 1
the 1
fever 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
custom 1
of 1
taking 1
every 1
night 1
a 1
small 1
quantity 1
of 1
laudanum 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
this 1
drug 1
only 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
enabled 1
to 1
gain 1
the 1
rest 1
necessary 1
for 1
the 1
preservation 1
of 1
life 1
Oppressed 1
by 1
the 1
recollection 1
of 1
my 1
various 1
misfortunes 1
I 1
now 1
swallowed 1
double 1
my 1
usual 1
quantity 1
and 1
soon 1
slept 1
profoundly 1
But 1
sleep 1
did 1
not 1
afford 1
me 1
respite 1
from 1
thought 1
and 1
misery 1
my 1
dreams 1
presented 1
a 1
thousand 1
objects 1
that 1
scared 1
me 1
Towards 1
morning 1
I 1
was 1
possessed 1
by 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
nightmare 1
I 1
felt 1
the 1
fiend 1
s 1
grasp 1
in 1
my 1
neck 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
free 1
myself 1
from 1
it 1
groans 1
and 1
cries 1
rang 1
in 1
my 1
ears 1
My 1
father 1
who 1
was 1
watching 1
over 1
me 1
perceiving 1
my 1
restlessness 1
awoke 1
me 1
the 1
dashing 1
waves 1
were 1
around 1
the 1
cloudy 1
sky 1
above 1
the 1
fiend 1
was 1
not 1
here 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
security 1
a 1
feeling 1
that 1
a 1
truce 1
was 1
established 1
between 1
the 1
present 1
hour 1
and 1
the 1
irresistible 1
disastrous 1
future 1
imparted 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
calm 1
forgetfulness 1
of 1
which 1
the 1
human 1
mind 1
is 1
by 1
its 1
structure 1
peculiarly 1
susceptible 1
Chapter 1
The 1
voyage 1
came 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
We 1
landed 1
and 1
proceeded 1
to 1
Paris 1
I 1
soon 1
found 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
overtaxed 1
my 1
strength 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
must 1
repose 1
before 1
I 1
could 1
continue 1
my 1
journey 1
My 1
father 1
s 1
care 1
and 1
attentions 1
were 1
indefatigable 1
but 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
the 1
origin 1
of 1
my 1
sufferings 1
and 1
sought 1
erroneous 1
methods 1
to 1
remedy 1
the 1
incurable 1
ill 1
He 1
wished 1
me 1
to 1
seek 1
amusement 1
in 1
society 1
I 1
abhorred 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
man 1
Oh 1
not 1
abhorred 1
They 1
were 1
my 1
brethren 1
my 1
fellow 1
beings 1
and 1
I 1
felt 1
attracted 1
even 1
to 1
the 1
most 1
repulsive 1
among 1
them 1
as 1
to 1
creatures 1
of 1
an 1
angelic 1
nature 1
and 1
celestial 1
mechanism 1
But 1
I 1
felt 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
right 1
to 1
share 1
their 1
intercourse 1
I 1
had 1
unchained 1
an 1
enemy 1
among 1
them 1
whose 1
joy 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
shed 1
their 1
blood 1
and 1
to 1
revel 1
in 1
their 1
groans 1
How 1
they 1
would 1
each 1
and 1
all 1
abhor 1
me 1
and 1
hunt 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
world 1
did 1
they 1
know 1
my 1
unhallowed 1
acts 1
and 1
the 1
crimes 1
which 1
had 1
their 1
source 1
in 1
me 1
My 1
father 1
yielded 1
at 1
length 1
to 1
my 1
desire 1
to 1
avoid 1
society 1
and 1
strove 1
by 1
various 1
arguments 1
to 1
banish 1
my 1
despair 1
Sometimes 1
he 1
thought 1
that 1
I 1
felt 1
deeply 1
the 1
degradation 1
of 1
being 1
obliged 1
to 1
answer 1
a 1
charge 1
of 1
murder 1
and 1
he 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
prove 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
futility 1
of 1
pride 1
Alas 1
My 1
father 1
said 1
I 1
how 1
little 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
me 1
Human 1
beings 1
their 1
feelings 1
and 1
passions 1
would 1
indeed 1
be 1
degraded 1
if 1
such 1
a 1
wretch 1
as 1
I 1
felt 1
pride 1
Justine 1
poor 1
unhappy 1
Justine 1
was 1
as 1
innocent 1
as 1
I 1
and 1
she 1
suffered 1
the 1
same 1
charge 1
she 1
died 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
this 1
I 1
murdered 1
her 1
William 1
Justine 1
and 1
Henry 1
they 1
all 1
died 1
by 1
my 1
hands 1
My 1
father 1
had 1
often 1
during 1
my 1
imprisonment 1
heard 1
me 1
make 1
the 1
same 1
assertion 1
when 1
I 1
thus 1
accused 1
myself 1
he 1
sometimes 1
seemed 1
to 1
desire 1
an 1
explanation 1
and 1
at 1
others 1
he 1
appeared 1
to 1
consider 1
it 1
as 1
the 1
offspring 1
of 1
delirium 1
and 1
that 1
during 1
my 1
illness 1
some 1
idea 1
of 1
this 1
kind 1
had 1
presented 1
itself 1
to 1
my 1
imagination 1
the 1
remembrance 1
of 1
which 1
I 1
preserved 1
in 1
my 1
convalescence 1
I 1
avoided 1
explanation 1
and 1
maintained 1
a 1
continual 1
silence 1
concerning 1
the 1
wretch 1
I 1
had 1
created 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
persuasion 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
supposed 1
mad 1
and 1
this 1
in 1
itself 1
would 1
forever 1
have 1
chained 1
my 1
tongue 1
But 1
besides 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
bring 1
myself 1
to 1
disclose 1
a 1
secret 1
which 1
would 1
fill 1
my 1
hearer 1
with 1
consternation 1
and 1
make 1
fear 1
and 1
unnatural 1
horror 1
the 1
inmates 1
of 1
his 1
breast 1
I 1
checked 1
therefore 1
my 1
impatient 1
thirst 1
for 1
sympathy 1
and 1
was 1
silent 1
when 1
I 1
would 1
have 1
given 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
have 1
confided 1
the 1
fatal 1
secret 1
Yet 1
still 1
words 1
like 1
those 1
I 1
have 1
recorded 1
would 1
burst 1
uncontrollably 1
from 1
me 1
I 1
could 1
offer 1
no 1
explanation 1
of 1
them 1
but 1
their 1
truth 1
in 1
part 1
relieved 1
the 1
burden 1
of 1
my 1
mysterious 1
woe 1
Upon 1
this 1
occasion 1
my 1
father 1
said 1
with 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
unbounded 1
wonder 1
My 1
dearest 1
Victor 1
what 1
infatuation 1
is 1
this 1
My 1
dear 1
son 1
I 1
entreat 1
you 1
never 1
to 1
make 1
such 1
an 1
assertion 1
again 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
mad 1
I 1
cried 1
energetically 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
the 1
heavens 1
who 1
have 1
viewed 1
my 1
operations 1
can 1
bear 1
witness 1
of 1
my 1
truth 1
I 1
am 1
the 1
assassin 1
of 1
those 1
most 1
innocent 1
victims 1
they 1
died 1
by 1
my 1
machinations 1
A 1
thousand 1
times 1
would 1
I 1
have 1
shed 1
my 1
own 1
blood 1
drop 1
by 1
drop 1
to 1
have 1
saved 1
their 1
lives 1
but 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
my 1
father 1
indeed 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
sacrifice 1
the 1
whole 1
human 1
race 1
The 1
conclusion 1
of 1
this 1
speech 1
convinced 1
my 1
father 1
that 1
my 1
ideas 1
were 1
deranged 1
and 1
he 1
instantly 1
changed 1
the 1
subject 1
of 1
our 1
conversation 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
alter 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
my 1
thoughts 1
He 1
wished 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
possible 1
to 1
obliterate 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
scenes 1
that 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
in 1
Ireland 1
and 1
never 1
alluded 1
to 1
them 1
or 1
suffered 1
me 1
to 1
speak 1
of 1
my 1
misfortunes 1
As 1
time 1
passed 1
away 1
I 1
became 1
more 1
calm 1
misery 1
had 1
her 1
dwelling 1
in 1
my 1
heart 1
but 1
I 1
no 1
longer 1
talked 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
incoherent 1
manner 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
crimes 1
sufficient 1
for 1
me 1
was 1
the 1
consciousness 1
of 1
them 1
By 1
the 1
utmost 1
self 1
violence 1
I 1
curbed 1
the 1
imperious 1
voice 1
of 1
wretchedness 1
which 1
sometimes 1
desired 1
to 1
declare 1
itself 1
to 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
and 1
my 1
manners 1
were 1
calmer 1
and 1
more 1
composed 1
than 1
they 1
had 1
ever 1
been 1
since 1
my 1
journey 1
to 1
the 1
sea 1
of 1
ice 1
A 1
few 1
days 1
before 1
we 1
left 1
Paris 1
on 1
our 1
way 1
to 1
Switzerland 1
I 1
received 1
the 1
following 1
letter 1
from 1
Elizabeth 1
My 1
dear 1
Friend 1
It 1
gave 1
me 1
the 1
greatest 1
pleasure 1
to 1
receive 1
a 1
letter 1
from 1
my 1
uncle 1
dated 1
at 1
Paris 1
you 1
are 1
no 1
longer 1
at 1
a 1
formidable 1
distance 1
and 1
I 1
may 1
hope 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
in 1
less 1
than 1
a 1
fortnight 1
My 1
poor 1
cousin 1
how 1
much 1
you 1
must 1
have 1
suffered 1
I 1
expect 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
looking 1
even 1
more 1
ill 1
than 1
when 1
you 1
quitted 1
Geneva 1
This 1
winter 1
has 1
been 1
passed 1
most 1
miserably 1
tortured 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
by 1
anxious 1
suspense 1
yet 1
I 1
hope 1
to 1
see 1
peace 1
in 1
your 1
countenance 1
and 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
your 1
heart 1
is 1
not 1
totally 1
void 1
of 1
comfort 1
and 1
tranquillity 1
Yet 1
I 1
fear 1
that 1
the 1
same 1
feelings 1
now 1
exist 1
that 1
made 1
you 1
so 1
miserable 1
a 1
year 1
ago 1
even 1
perhaps 1
augmented 1
by 1
time 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
disturb 1
you 1
at 1
this 1
period 1
when 1
so 1
many 1
misfortunes 1
weigh 1
upon 1
you 1
but 1
a 1
conversation 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
with 1
my 1
uncle 1
previous 1
to 1
his 1
departure 1
renders 1
some 1
explanation 1
necessary 1
before 1
we 1
meet 1
Explanation 1
You 1
may 1
possibly 1
say 1
What 1
can 1
Elizabeth 1
have 1
to 1
explain 1
If 1
you 1
really 1
say 1
this 1
my 1
questions 1
are 1
answered 1
and 1
all 1
my 1
doubts 1
satisfied 1
But 1
you 1
are 1
distant 1
from 1
me 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
possible 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
dread 1
and 1
yet 1
be 1
pleased 1
with 1
this 1
explanation 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
probability 1
of 1
this 1
being 1
the 1
case 1
I 1
dare 1
not 1
any 1
longer 1
postpone 1
writing 1
what 1
during 1
your 1
absence 1
I 1
have 1
often 1
wished 1
to 1
express 1
to 1
you 1
but 1
have 1
never 1
had 1
the 1
courage 1
to 1
begin 1
You 1
well 1
know 1
Victor 1
that 1
our 1
union 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
favourite 1
plan 1
of 1
your 1
parents 1
ever 1
since 1
our 1
infancy 1
We 1
were 1
told 1
this 1
when 1
young 1
and 1
taught 1
to 1
look 1
forward 1
to 1
it 1
as 1
an 1
event 1
that 1
would 1
certainly 1
take 1
place 1
We 1
were 1
affectionate 1
playfellows 1
during 1
childhood 1
and 1
I 1
believe 1
dear 1
and 1
valued 1
friends 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
as 1
we 1
grew 1
older 1
But 1
as 1
brother 1
and 1
sister 1
often 1
entertain 1
a 1
lively 1
affection 1
towards 1
each 1
other 1
without 1
desiring 1
a 1
more 1
intimate 1
union 1
may 1
not 1
such 1
also 1
be 1
our 1
case 1
Tell 1
me 1
dearest 1
Victor 1
Answer 1
me 1
I 1
conjure 1
you 1
by 1
our 1
mutual 1
happiness 1
with 1
simple 1
truth 1
Do 1
you 1
not 1
love 1
another 1
You 1
have 1
travelled 1
you 1
have 1
spent 1
several 1
years 1
of 1
your 1
life 1
at 1
Ingolstadt 1
and 1
I 1
confess 1
to 1
you 1
my 1
friend 1
that 1
when 1
I 1
saw 1
you 1
last 1
autumn 1
so 1
unhappy 1
flying 1
to 1
solitude 1
from 1
the 1
society 1
of 1
every 1
creature 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
supposing 1
that 1
you 1
might 1
regret 1
our 1
connection 1
and 1
believe 1
yourself 1
bound 1
in 1
honour 1
to 1
fulfil 1
the 1
wishes 1
of 1
your 1
parents 1
although 1
they 1
opposed 1
themselves 1
to 1
your 1
inclinations 1
But 1
this 1
is 1
false 1
reasoning 1
I 1
confess 1
to 1
you 1
my 1
friend 1
that 1
I 1
love 1
you 1
and 1
that 1
in 1
my 1
airy 1
dreams 1
of 1
futurity 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
my 1
constant 1
friend 1
and 1
companion 1
But 1
it 1
is 1
your 1
happiness 1
I 1
desire 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
my 1
own 1
when 1
I 1
declare 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
our 1
marriage 1
would 1
render 1
me 1
eternally 1
miserable 1
unless 1
it 1
were 1
the 1
dictate 1
of 1
your 1
own 1
free 1
choice 1
Even 1
now 1
I 1
weep 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
borne 1
down 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
by 1
the 1
cruellest 1
misfortunes 1
you 1
may 1
stifle 1
by 1
the 1
word 1
honour 1
all 1
hope 1
of 1
that 1
love 1
and 1
happiness 1
which 1
would 1
alone 1
restore 1
you 1
to 1
yourself 1
I 1
who 1
have 1
so 1
disinterested 1
an 1
affection 1
for 1
you 1
may 1
increase 1
your 1
miseries 1
tenfold 1
by 1
being 1
an 1
obstacle 1
to 1
your 1
wishes 1
Ah 1
Victor 1
be 1
assured 1
that 1
your 1
cousin 1
and 1
playmate 1
has 1
too 1
sincere 1
a 1
love 1
for 1
you 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
made 1
miserable 1
by 1
this 1
supposition 1
Be 1
happy 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
obey 1
me 1
in 1
this 1
one 1
request 1
remain 1
satisfied 1
that 1
nothing 1
on 1
earth 1
will 1
have 1
the 1
power 1
to 1
interrupt 1
my 1
tranquillity 1
Do 1
not 1
let 1
this 1
letter 1
disturb 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
answer 1
tomorrow 1
or 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
or 1
even 1
until 1
you 1
come 1
if 1
it 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
pain 1
My 1
uncle 1
will 1
send 1
me 1
news 1
of 1
your 1
health 1
and 1
if 1
I 1
see 1
but 1
one 1
smile 1
on 1
your 1
lips 1
when 1
we 1
meet 1
occasioned 1
by 1
this 1
or 1
any 1
other 1
exertion 1
of 1
mine 1
I 1
shall 1
need 1
no 1
other 1
happiness 1
Elizabeth 1
Lavenza 1
Geneva 1
May 1
th 1
This 1
letter 1
revived 1
in 1
my 1
memory 1
what 1
I 1
had 1
before 1
forgotten 1
the 1
threat 1
of 1
the 1
fiend 1
I 1
WILL 1
BE 1
WITH 1
YOU 1
ON 1
YOUR 1
WEDDING 1
NIGHT 1
Such 1
was 1
my 1
sentence 1
and 1
on 1
that 1
night 1
would 1
the 1
daemon 1
employ 1
every 1
art 1
to 1
destroy 1
me 1
and 1
tear 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
glimpse 1
of 1
happiness 1
which 1
promised 1
partly 1
to 1
console 1
my 1
sufferings 1
On 1
that 1
night 1
he 1
had 1
determined 1
to 1
consummate 1
his 1
crimes 1
by 1
my 1
death 1
Well 1
be 1
it 1
so 1
a 1
deadly 1
struggle 1
would 1
then 1
assuredly 1
take 1
place 1
in 1
which 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
victorious 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
at 1
peace 1
and 1
his 1
power 1
over 1
me 1
be 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
If 1
he 1
were 1
vanquished 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
a 1
free 1
man 1
Alas 1
What 1
freedom 1
Such 1
as 1
the 1
peasant 1
enjoys 1
when 1
his 1
family 1
have 1
been 1
massacred 1
before 1
his 1
eyes 1
his 1
cottage 1
burnt 1
his 1
lands 1
laid 1
waste 1
and 1
he 1
is 1
turned 1
adrift 1
homeless 1
penniless 1
and 1
alone 1
but 1
free 1
Such 1
would 1
be 1
my 1
liberty 1
except 1
that 1
in 1
my 1
Elizabeth 1
I 1
possessed 1
a 1
treasure 1
alas 1
balanced 1
by 1
those 1
horrors 1
of 1
remorse 1
and 1
guilt 1
which 1
would 1
pursue 1
me 1
until 1
death 1
Sweet 1
and 1
beloved 1
Elizabeth 1
I 1
read 1
and 1
reread 1
her 1
letter 1
and 1
some 1
softened 1
feelings 1
stole 1
into 1
my 1
heart 1
and 1
dared 1
to 1
whisper 1
paradisiacal 1
dreams 1
of 1
love 1
and 1
joy 1
but 1
the 1
apple 1
was 1
already 1
eaten 1
and 1
the 1
angel 1
s 1
arm 1
bared 1
to 1
drive 1
me 1
from 1
all 1
hope 1
Yet 1
I 1
would 1
die 1
to 1
make 1
her 1
happy 1
If 1
the 1
monster 1
executed 1
his 1
threat 1
death 1
was 1
inevitable 1
yet 1
again 1
I 1
considered 1
whether 1
my 1
marriage 1
would 1
hasten 1
my 1
fate 1
My 1
destruction 1
might 1
indeed 1
arrive 1
a 1
few 1
months 1
sooner 1
but 1
if 1
my 1
torturer 1
should 1
suspect 1
that 1
I 1
postponed 1
it 1
influenced 1
by 1
his 1
menaces 1
he 1
would 1
surely 1
find 1
other 1
and 1
perhaps 1
more 1
dreadful 1
means 1
of 1
revenge 1
He 1
had 1
vowed 1
TO 1
BE 1
WITH 1
ME 1
ON 1
MY 1
WEDDING 1
NIGHT 1
yet 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
consider 1
that 1
threat 1
as 1
binding 1
him 1
to 1
peace 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
for 1
as 1
if 1
to 1
show 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
yet 1
satiated 1
with 1
blood 1
he 1
had 1
murdered 1
Clerval 1
immediately 1
after 1
the 1
enunciation 1
of 1
his 1
threats 1
I 1
resolved 1
therefore 1
that 1
if 1
my 1
immediate 1
union 1
with 1
my 1
cousin 1
would 1
conduce 1
either 1
to 1
hers 1
or 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
happiness 1
my 1
adversary 1
s 1
designs 1
against 1
my 1
life 1
should 1
not 1
retard 1
it 1
a 1
single 1
hour 1
In 1
this 1
state 1
of 1
mind 1
I 1
wrote 1
to 1
Elizabeth 1
My 1
letter 1
was 1
calm 1
and 1
affectionate 1
I 1
fear 1
my 1
beloved 1
girl 1
I 1
said 1
little 1
happiness 1
remains 1
for 1
us 1
on 1
earth 1
yet 1
all 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
one 1
day 1
enjoy 1
is 1
centred 1
in 1
you 1
Chase 1
away 1
your 1
idle 1
fears 1
to 1
you 1
alone 1
do 1
I 1
consecrate 1
my 1
life 1
and 1
my 1
endeavours 1
for 1
contentment 1
I 1
have 1
one 1
secret 1
Elizabeth 1
a 1
dreadful 1
one 1
when 1
revealed 1
to 1
you 1
it 1
will 1
chill 1
your 1
frame 1
with 1
horror 1
and 1
then 1
far 1
from 1
being 1
surprised 1
at 1
my 1
misery 1
you 1
will 1
only 1
wonder 1
that 1
I 1
survive 1
what 1
I 1
have 1
endured 1
I 1
will 1
confide 1
this 1
tale 1
of 1
misery 1
and 1
terror 1
to 1
you 1
the 1
day 1
after 1
our 1
marriage 1
shall 1
take 1
place 1
for 1
my 1
sweet 1
cousin 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
perfect 1
confidence 1
between 1
us 1
But 1
until 1
then 1
I 1
conjure 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
mention 1
or 1
allude 1
to 1
it 1
This 1
I 1
most 1
earnestly 1
entreat 1
and 1
I 1
know 1
you 1
will 1
comply 1
In 1
about 1
a 1
week 1
after 1
the 1
arrival 1
of 1
Elizabeth 1
s 1
letter 1
we 1
returned 1
to 1
Geneva 1
The 1
sweet 1
girl 1
welcomed 1
me 1
with 1
warm 1
affection 1
yet 1
tears 1
were 1
in 1
her 1
eyes 1
as 1
she 1
beheld 1
my 1
emaciated 1
frame 1
and 1
feverish 1
cheeks 1
I 1
saw 1
a 1
change 1
in 1
her 1
also 1
She 1
was 1
thinner 1
and 1
had 1
lost 1
much 1
of 1
that 1
heavenly 1
vivacity 1
that 1
had 1
before 1
charmed 1
me 1
but 1
her 1
gentleness 1
and 1
soft 1
looks 1
of 1
compassion 1
made 1
her 1
a 1
more 1
fit 1
companion 1
for 1
one 1
blasted 1
and 1
miserable 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
The 1
tranquillity 1
which 1
I 1
now 1
enjoyed 1
did 1
not 1
endure 1
Memory 1
brought 1
madness 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
what 1
had 1
passed 1
a 1
real 1
insanity 1
possessed 1
me 1
sometimes 1
I 1
was 1
furious 1
and 1
burnt 1
with 1
rage 1
sometimes 1
low 1
and 1
despondent 1
I 1
neither 1
spoke 1
nor 1
looked 1
at 1
anyone 1
but 1
sat 1
motionless 1
bewildered 1
by 1
the 1
multitude 1
of 1
miseries 1
that 1
overcame 1
me 1
Elizabeth 1
alone 1
had 1
the 1
power 1
to 1
draw 1
me 1
from 1
these 1
fits 1
her 1
gentle 1
voice 1
would 1
soothe 1
me 1
when 1
transported 1
by 1
passion 1
and 1
inspire 1
me 1
with 1
human 1
feelings 1
when 1
sunk 1
in 1
torpor 1
She 1
wept 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
for 1
me 1
When 1
reason 1
returned 1
she 1
would 1
remonstrate 1
and 1
endeavour 1
to 1
inspire 1
me 1
with 1
resignation 1
Ah 1
It 1
is 1
well 1
for 1
the 1
unfortunate 1
to 1
be 1
resigned 1
but 1
for 1
the 1
guilty 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
peace 1
The 1
agonies 1
of 1
remorse 1
poison 1
the 1
luxury 1
there 1
is 1
otherwise 1
sometimes 1
found 1
in 1
indulging 1
the 1
excess 1
of 1
grief 1
Soon 1
after 1
my 1
arrival 1
my 1
father 1
spoke 1
of 1
my 1
immediate 1
marriage 1
with 1
Elizabeth 1
I 1
remained 1
silent 1
Have 1
you 1
then 1
some 1
other 1
attachment 1
None 1
on 1
earth 1
I 1
love 1
Elizabeth 1
and 1
look 1
forward 1
to 1
our 1
union 1
with 1
delight 1
Let 1
the 1
day 1
therefore 1
be 1
fixed 1
and 1
on 1
it 1
I 1
will 1
consecrate 1
myself 1
in 1
life 1
or 1
death 1
to 1
the 1
happiness 1
of 1
my 1
cousin 1
My 1
dear 1
Victor 1
do 1
not 1
speak 1
thus 1
Heavy 1
misfortunes 1
have 1
befallen 1
us 1
but 1
let 1
us 1
only 1
cling 1
closer 1
to 1
what 1
remains 1
and 1
transfer 1
our 1
love 1
for 1
those 1
whom 1
we 1
have 1
lost 1
to 1
those 1
who 1
yet 1
live 1
Our 1
circle 1
will 1
be 1
small 1
but 1
bound 1
close 1
by 1
the 1
ties 1
of 1
affection 1
and 1
mutual 1
misfortune 1
And 1
when 1
time 1
shall 1
have 1
softened 1
your 1
despair 1
new 1
and 1
dear 1
objects 1
of 1
care 1
will 1
be 1
born 1
to 1
replace 1
those 1
of 1
whom 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
cruelly 1
deprived 1
Such 1
were 1
the 1
lessons 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
But 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
remembrance 1
of 1
the 1
threat 1
returned 1
nor 1
can 1
you 1
wonder 1
that 1
omnipotent 1
as 1
the 1
fiend 1
had 1
yet 1
been 1
in 1
his 1
deeds 1
of 1
blood 1
I 1
should 1
almost 1
regard 1
him 1
as 1
invincible 1
and 1
that 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
pronounced 1
the 1
words 1
I 1
SHALL 1
BE 1
WITH 1
YOU 1
ON 1
YOUR 1
WEDDING 1
NIGHT 1
I 1
should 1
regard 1
the 1
threatened 1
fate 1
as 1
unavoidable 1
But 1
death 1
was 1
no 1
evil 1
to 1
me 1
if 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
Elizabeth 1
were 1
balanced 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
I 1
therefore 1
with 1
a 1
contented 1
and 1
even 1
cheerful 1
countenance 1
agreed 1
with 1
my 1
father 1
that 1
if 1
my 1
cousin 1
would 1
consent 1
the 1
ceremony 1
should 1
take 1
place 1
in 1
ten 1
days 1
and 1
thus 1
put 1
as 1
I 1
imagined 1
the 1
seal 1
to 1
my 1
fate 1
Great 1
God 1
If 1
for 1
one 1
instant 1
I 1
had 1
thought 1
what 1
might 1
be 1
the 1
hellish 1
intention 1
of 1
my 1
fiendish 1
adversary 1
I 1
would 1
rather 1
have 1
banished 1
myself 1
forever 1
from 1
my 1
native 1
country 1
and 1
wandered 1
a 1
friendless 1
outcast 1
over 1
the 1
earth 1
than 1
have 1
consented 1
to 1
this 1
miserable 1
marriage 1
But 1
as 1
if 1
possessed 1
of 1
magic 1
powers 1
the 1
monster 1
had 1
blinded 1
me 1
to 1
his 1
real 1
intentions 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
prepared 1
only 1
my 1
own 1
death 1
I 1
hastened 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
far 1
dearer 1
victim 1
As 1
the 1
period 1
fixed 1
for 1
our 1
marriage 1
drew 1
nearer 1
whether 1
from 1
cowardice 1
or 1
a 1
prophetic 1
feeling 1
I 1
felt 1
my 1
heart 1
sink 1
within 1
me 1
But 1
I 1
concealed 1
my 1
feelings 1
by 1
an 1
appearance 1
of 1
hilarity 1
that 1
brought 1
smiles 1
and 1
joy 1
to 1
the 1
countenance 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
but 1
hardly 1
deceived 1
the 1
ever 1
watchful 1
and 1
nicer 1
eye 1
of 1
Elizabeth 1
She 1
looked 1
forward 1
to 1
our 1
union 1
with 1
placid 1
contentment 1
not 1
unmingled 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
fear 1
which 1
past 1
misfortunes 1
had 1
impressed 1
that 1
what 1
now 1
appeared 1
certain 1
and 1
tangible 1
happiness 1
might 1
soon 1
dissipate 1
into 1
an 1
airy 1
dream 1
and 1
leave 1
no 1
trace 1
but 1
deep 1
and 1
everlasting 1
regret 1
Preparations 1
were 1
made 1
for 1
the 1
event 1
congratulatory 1
visits 1
were 1
received 1
and 1
all 1
wore 1
a 1
smiling 1
appearance 1
I 1
shut 1
up 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
heart 1
the 1
anxiety 1
that 1
preyed 1
there 1
and 1
entered 1
with 1
seeming 1
earnestness 1
into 1
the 1
plans 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
although 1
they 1
might 1
only 1
serve 1
as 1
the 1
decorations 1
of 1
my 1
tragedy 1
Through 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
exertions 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
inheritance 1
of 1
Elizabeth 1
had 1
been 1
restored 1
to 1
her 1
by 1
the 1
Austrian 1
government 1
A 1
small 1
possession 1
on 1
the 1
shores 1
of 1
Como 1
belonged 1
to 1
her 1
It 1
was 1
agreed 1
that 1
immediately 1
after 1
our 1
union 1
we 1
should 1
proceed 1
to 1
Villa 1
Lavenza 1
and 1
spend 1
our 1
first 1
days 1
of 1
happiness 1
beside 1
the 1
beautiful 1
lake 1
near 1
which 1
it 1
stood 1
In 1
the 1
meantime 1
I 1
took 1
every 1
precaution 1
to 1
defend 1
my 1
person 1
in 1
case 1
the 1
fiend 1
should 1
openly 1
attack 1
me 1
I 1
carried 1
pistols 1
and 1
a 1
dagger 1
constantly 1
about 1
me 1
and 1
was 1
ever 1
on 1
the 1
watch 1
to 1
prevent 1
artifice 1
and 1
by 1
these 1
means 1
gained 1
a 1
greater 1
degree 1
of 1
tranquillity 1
Indeed 1
as 1
the 1
period 1
approached 1
the 1
threat 1
appeared 1
more 1
as 1
a 1
delusion 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
regarded 1
as 1
worthy 1
to 1
disturb 1
my 1
peace 1
while 1
the 1
happiness 1
I 1
hoped 1
for 1
in 1
my 1
marriage 1
wore 1
a 1
greater 1
appearance 1
of 1
certainty 1
as 1
the 1
day 1
fixed 1
for 1
its 1
solemnization 1
drew 1
nearer 1
and 1
I 1
heard 1
it 1
continually 1
spoken 1
of 1
as 1
an 1
occurrence 1
which 1
no 1
accident 1
could 1
possibly 1
prevent 1
Elizabeth 1
seemed 1
happy 1
my 1
tranquil 1
demeanour 1
contributed 1
greatly 1
to 1
calm 1
her 1
mind 1
But 1
on 1
the 1
day 1
that 1
was 1
to 1
fulfil 1
my 1
wishes 1
and 1
my 1
destiny 1
she 1
was 1
melancholy 1
and 1
a 1
presentiment 1
of 1
evil 1
pervaded 1
her 1
and 1
perhaps 1
also 1
she 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
dreadful 1
secret 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
promised 1
to 1
reveal 1
to 1
her 1
on 1
the 1
following 1
day 1
My 1
father 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
overjoyed 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
bustle 1
of 1
preparation 1
only 1
recognized 1
in 1
the 1
melancholy 1
of 1
his 1
niece 1
the 1
diffidence 1
of 1
a 1
bride 1
After 1
the 1
ceremony 1
was 1
performed 1
a 1
large 1
party 1
assembled 1
at 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
agreed 1
that 1
Elizabeth 1
and 1
I 1
should 1
commence 1
our 1
journey 1
by 1
water 1
sleeping 1
that 1
night 1
at 1
Evian 1
and 1
continuing 1
our 1
voyage 1
on 1
the 1
following 1
day 1
The 1
day 1
was 1
fair 1
the 1
wind 1
favourable 1
all 1
smiled 1
on 1
our 1
nuptial 1
embarkation 1
Those 1
were 1
the 1
last 1
moments 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
during 1
which 1
I 1
enjoyed 1
the 1
feeling 1
of 1
happiness 1
We 1
passed 1
rapidly 1
along 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
hot 1
but 1
we 1
were 1
sheltered 1
from 1
its 1
rays 1
by 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
canopy 1
while 1
we 1
enjoyed 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
the 1
scene 1
sometimes 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
where 1
we 1
saw 1
Mont 1
Saleve 1
the 1
pleasant 1
banks 1
of 1
Montalegre 1
and 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
surmounting 1
all 1
the 1
beautiful 1
Mont 1
Blanc 1
and 1
the 1
assemblage 1
of 1
snowy 1
mountains 1
that 1
in 1
vain 1
endeavour 1
to 1
emulate 1
her 1
sometimes 1
coasting 1
the 1
opposite 1
banks 1
we 1
saw 1
the 1
mighty 1
Jura 1
opposing 1
its 1
dark 1
side 1
to 1
the 1
ambition 1
that 1
would 1
quit 1
its 1
native 1
country 1
and 1
an 1
almost 1
insurmountable 1
barrier 1
to 1
the 1
invader 1
who 1
should 1
wish 1
to 1
enslave 1
it 1
I 1
took 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
Elizabeth 1
You 1
are 1
sorrowful 1
my 1
love 1
Ah 1
If 1
you 1
knew 1
what 1
I 1
have 1
suffered 1
and 1
what 1
I 1
may 1
yet 1
endure 1
you 1
would 1
endeavour 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
taste 1
the 1
quiet 1
and 1
freedom 1
from 1
despair 1
that 1
this 1
one 1
day 1
at 1
least 1
permits 1
me 1
to 1
enjoy 1
Be 1
happy 1
my 1
dear 1
Victor 1
replied 1
Elizabeth 1
there 1
is 1
I 1
hope 1
nothing 1
to 1
distress 1
you 1
and 1
be 1
assured 1
that 1
if 1
a 1
lively 1
joy 1
is 1
not 1
painted 1
in 1
my 1
face 1
my 1
heart 1
is 1
contented 1
Something 1
whispers 1
to 1
me 1
not 1
to 1
depend 1
too 1
much 1
on 1
the 1
prospect 1
that 1
is 1
opened 1
before 1
us 1
but 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
listen 1
to 1
such 1
a 1
sinister 1
voice 1
Observe 1
how 1
fast 1
we 1
move 1
along 1
and 1
how 1
the 1
clouds 1
which 1
sometimes 1
obscure 1
and 1
sometimes 1
rise 1
above 1
the 1
dome 1
of 1
Mont 1
Blanc 1
render 1
this 1
scene 1
of 1
beauty 1
still 1
more 1
interesting 1
Look 1
also 1
at 1
the 1
innumerable 1
fish 1
that 1
are 1
swimming 1
in 1
the 1
clear 1
waters 1
where 1
we 1
can 1
distinguish 1
every 1
pebble 1
that 1
lies 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
What 1
a 1
divine 1
day 1
How 1
happy 1
and 1
serene 1
all 1
nature 1
appears 1
Thus 1
Elizabeth 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
divert 1
her 1
thoughts 1
and 1
mine 1
from 1
all 1
reflection 1
upon 1
melancholy 1
subjects 1
But 1
her 1
temper 1
was 1
fluctuating 1
joy 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
instants 1
shone 1
in 1
her 1
eyes 1
but 1
it 1
continually 1
gave 1
place 1
to 1
distraction 1
and 1
reverie 1
The 1
sun 1
sank 1
lower 1
in 1
the 1
heavens 1
we 1
passed 1
the 1
river 1
Drance 1
and 1
observed 1
its 1
path 1
through 1
the 1
chasms 1
of 1
the 1
higher 1
and 1
the 1
glens 1
of 1
the 1
lower 1
hills 1
The 1
Alps 1
here 1
come 1
closer 1
to 1
the 1
lake 1
and 1
we 1
approached 1
the 1
amphitheatre 1
of 1
mountains 1
which 1
forms 1
its 1
eastern 1
boundary 1
The 1
spire 1
of 1
Evian 1
shone 1
under 1
the 1
woods 1
that 1
surrounded 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
range 1
of 1
mountain 1
above 1
mountain 1
by 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
overhung 1
The 1
wind 1
which 1
had 1
hitherto 1
carried 1
us 1
along 1
with 1
amazing 1
rapidity 1
sank 1
at 1
sunset 1
to 1
a 1
light 1
breeze 1
the 1
soft 1
air 1
just 1
ruffled 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
caused 1
a 1
pleasant 1
motion 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
as 1
we 1
approached 1
the 1
shore 1
from 1
which 1
it 1
wafted 1
the 1
most 1
delightful 1
scent 1
of 1
flowers 1
and 1
hay 1
The 1
sun 1
sank 1
beneath 1
the 1
horizon 1
as 1
we 1
landed 1
and 1
as 1
I 1
touched 1
the 1
shore 1
I 1
felt 1
those 1
cares 1
and 1
fears 1
revive 1
which 1
soon 1
were 1
to 1
clasp 1
me 1
and 1
cling 1
to 1
me 1
forever 1
Chapter 1
It 1
was 1
eight 1
o 1
clock 1
when 1
we 1
landed 1
we 1
walked 1
for 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
on 1
the 1
shore 1
enjoying 1
the 1
transitory 1
light 1
and 1
then 1
retired 1
to 1
the 1
inn 1
and 1
contemplated 1
the 1
lovely 1
scene 1
of 1
waters 1
woods 1
and 1
mountains 1
obscured 1
in 1
darkness 1
yet 1
still 1
displaying 1
their 1
black 1
outlines 1
The 1
wind 1
which 1
had 1
fallen 1
in 1
the 1
south 1
now 1
rose 1
with 1
great 1
violence 1
in 1
the 1
west 1
The 1
moon 1
had 1
reached 1
her 1
summit 1
in 1
the 1
heavens 1
and 1
was 1
beginning 1
to 1
descend 1
the 1
clouds 1
swept 1
across 1
it 1
swifter 1
than 1
the 1
flight 1
of 1
the 1
vulture 1
and 1
dimmed 1
her 1
rays 1
while 1
the 1
lake 1
reflected 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
busy 1
heavens 1
rendered 1
still 1
busier 1
by 1
the 1
restless 1
waves 1
that 1
were 1
beginning 1
to 1
rise 1
Suddenly 1
a 1
heavy 1
storm 1
of 1
rain 1
descended 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
calm 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
but 1
so 1
soon 1
as 1
night 1
obscured 1
the 1
shapes 1
of 1
objects 1
a 1
thousand 1
fears 1
arose 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
I 1
was 1
anxious 1
and 1
watchful 1
while 1
my 1
right 1
hand 1
grasped 1
a 1
pistol 1
which 1
was 1
hidden 1
in 1
my 1
bosom 1
every 1
sound 1
terrified 1
me 1
but 1
I 1
resolved 1
that 1
I 1
would 1
sell 1
my 1
life 1
dearly 1
and 1
not 1
shrink 1
from 1
the 1
conflict 1
until 1
my 1
own 1
life 1
or 1
that 1
of 1
my 1
adversary 1
was 1
extinguished 1
Elizabeth 1
observed 1
my 1
agitation 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
in 1
timid 1
and 1
fearful 1
silence 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
my 1
glance 1
which 1
communicated 1
terror 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
trembling 1
she 1
asked 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
agitates 1
you 1
my 1
dear 1
Victor 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
you 1
fear 1
Oh 1
Peace 1
peace 1
my 1
love 1
replied 1
I 1
this 1
night 1
and 1
all 1
will 1
be 1
safe 1
but 1
this 1
night 1
is 1
dreadful 1
very 1
dreadful 1
I 1
passed 1
an 1
hour 1
in 1
this 1
state 1
of 1
mind 1
when 1
suddenly 1
I 1
reflected 1
how 1
fearful 1
the 1
combat 1
which 1
I 1
momentarily 1
expected 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
my 1
wife 1
and 1
I 1
earnestly 1
entreated 1
her 1
to 1
retire 1
resolving 1
not 1
to 1
join 1
her 1
until 1
I 1
had 1
obtained 1
some 1
knowledge 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
situation 1
of 1
my 1
enemy 1
She 1
left 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
continued 1
some 1
time 1
walking 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
passages 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
inspecting 1
every 1
corner 1
that 1
might 1
afford 1
a 1
retreat 1
to 1
my 1
adversary 1
But 1
I 1
discovered 1
no 1
trace 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
was 1
beginning 1
to 1
conjecture 1
that 1
some 1
fortunate 1
chance 1
had 1
intervened 1
to 1
prevent 1
the 1
execution 1
of 1
his 1
menaces 1
when 1
suddenly 1
I 1
heard 1
a 1
shrill 1
and 1
dreadful 1
scream 1
It 1
came 1
from 1
the 1
room 1
into 1
which 1
Elizabeth 1
had 1
retired 1
As 1
I 1
heard 1
it 1
the 1
whole 1
truth 1
rushed 1
into 1
my 1
mind 1
my 1
arms 1
dropped 1
the 1
motion 1
of 1
every 1
muscle 1
and 1
fibre 1
was 1
suspended 1
I 1
could 1
feel 1
the 1
blood 1
trickling 1
in 1
my 1
veins 1
and 1
tingling 1
in 1
the 1
extremities 1
of 1
my 1
limbs 1
This 1
state 1
lasted 1
but 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
the 1
scream 1
was 1
repeated 1
and 1
I 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
Great 1
God 1
Why 1
did 1
I 1
not 1
then 1
expire 1
Why 1
am 1
I 1
here 1
to 1
relate 1
the 1
destruction 1
of 1
the 1
best 1
hope 1
and 1
the 1
purest 1
creature 1
on 1
earth 1
She 1
was 1
there 1
lifeless 1
and 1
inanimate 1
thrown 1
across 1
the 1
bed 1
her 1
head 1
hanging 1
down 1
and 1
her 1
pale 1
and 1
distorted 1
features 1
half 1
covered 1
by 1
her 1
hair 1
Everywhere 1
I 1
turn 1
I 1
see 1
the 1
same 1
figure 1
her 1
bloodless 1
arms 1
and 1
relaxed 1
form 1
flung 1
by 1
the 1
murderer 1
on 1
its 1
bridal 1
bier 1
Could 1
I 1
behold 1
this 1
and 1
live 1
Alas 1
Life 1
is 1
obstinate 1
and 1
clings 1
closest 1
where 1
it 1
is 1
most 1
hated 1
For 1
a 1
moment 1
only 1
did 1
I 1
lose 1
recollection 1
I 1
fell 1
senseless 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
When 1
I 1
recovered 1
I 1
found 1
myself 1
surrounded 1
by 1
the 1
people 1
of 1
the 1
inn 1
their 1
countenances 1
expressed 1
a 1
breathless 1
terror 1
but 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
others 1
appeared 1
only 1
as 1
a 1
mockery 1
a 1
shadow 1
of 1
the 1
feelings 1
that 1
oppressed 1
me 1
I 1
escaped 1
from 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
lay 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
Elizabeth 1
my 1
love 1
my 1
wife 1
so 1
lately 1
living 1
so 1
dear 1
so 1
worthy 1
She 1
had 1
been 1
moved 1
from 1
the 1
posture 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
first 1
beheld 1
her 1
and 1
now 1
as 1
she 1
lay 1
her 1
head 1
upon 1
her 1
arm 1
and 1
a 1
handkerchief 1
thrown 1
across 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
neck 1
I 1
might 1
have 1
supposed 1
her 1
asleep 1
I 1
rushed 1
towards 1
her 1
and 1
embraced 1
her 1
with 1
ardour 1
but 1
the 1
deadly 1
languor 1
and 1
coldness 1
of 1
the 1
limbs 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
what 1
I 1
now 1
held 1
in 1
my 1
arms 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
Elizabeth 1
whom 1
I 1
had 1
loved 1
and 1
cherished 1
The 1
murderous 1
mark 1
of 1
the 1
fiend 1
s 1
grasp 1
was 1
on 1
her 1
neck 1
and 1
the 1
breath 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
issue 1
from 1
her 1
lips 1
While 1
I 1
still 1
hung 1
over 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
agony 1
of 1
despair 1
I 1
happened 1
to 1
look 1
up 1
The 1
windows 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
had 1
before 1
been 1
darkened 1
and 1
I 1
felt 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
panic 1
on 1
seeing 1
the 1
pale 1
yellow 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
moon 1
illuminate 1
the 1
chamber 1
The 1
shutters 1
had 1
been 1
thrown 1
back 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
sensation 1
of 1
horror 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
described 1
I 1
saw 1
at 1
the 1
open 1
window 1
a 1
figure 1
the 1
most 1
hideous 1
and 1
abhorred 1
A 1
grin 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
monster 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
jeer 1
as 1
with 1
his 1
fiendish 1
finger 1
he 1
pointed 1
towards 1
the 1
corpse 1
of 1
my 1
wife 1
I 1
rushed 1
towards 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
drawing 1
a 1
pistol 1
from 1
my 1
bosom 1
fired 1
but 1
he 1
eluded 1
me 1
leaped 1
from 1
his 1
station 1
and 1
running 1
with 1
the 1
swiftness 1
of 1
lightning 1
plunged 1
into 1
the 1
lake 1
The 1
report 1
of 1
the 1
pistol 1
brought 1
a 1
crowd 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
I 1
pointed 1
to 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
disappeared 1
and 1
we 1
followed 1
the 1
track 1
with 1
boats 1
nets 1
were 1
cast 1
but 1
in 1
vain 1
After 1
passing 1
several 1
hours 1
we 1
returned 1
hopeless 1
most 1
of 1
my 1
companions 1
believing 1
it 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
form 1
conjured 1
up 1
by 1
my 1
fancy 1
After 1
having 1
landed 1
they 1
proceeded 1
to 1
search 1
the 1
country 1
parties 1
going 1
in 1
different 1
directions 1
among 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
vines 1
I 1
attempted 1
to 1
accompany 1
them 1
and 1
proceeded 1
a 1
short 1
distance 1
from 1
the 1
house 1
but 1
my 1
head 1
whirled 1
round 1
my 1
steps 1
were 1
like 1
those 1
of 1
a 1
drunken 1
man 1
I 1
fell 1
at 1
last 1
in 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
utter 1
exhaustion 1
a 1
film 1
covered 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
my 1
skin 1
was 1
parched 1
with 1
the 1
heat 1
of 1
fever 1
In 1
this 1
state 1
I 1
was 1
carried 1
back 1
and 1
placed 1
on 1
a 1
bed 1
hardly 1
conscious 1
of 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
my 1
eyes 1
wandered 1
round 1
the 1
room 1
as 1
if 1
to 1
seek 1
something 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
lost 1
After 1
an 1
interval 1
I 1
arose 1
and 1
as 1
if 1
by 1
instinct 1
crawled 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
the 1
corpse 1
of 1
my 1
beloved 1
lay 1
There 1
were 1
women 1
weeping 1
around 1
I 1
hung 1
over 1
it 1
and 1
joined 1
my 1
sad 1
tears 1
to 1
theirs 1
all 1
this 1
time 1
no 1
distinct 1
idea 1
presented 1
itself 1
to 1
my 1
mind 1
but 1
my 1
thoughts 1
rambled 1
to 1
various 1
subjects 1
reflecting 1
confusedly 1
on 1
my 1
misfortunes 1
and 1
their 1
cause 1
I 1
was 1
bewildered 1
in 1
a 1
cloud 1
of 1
wonder 1
and 1
horror 1
The 1
death 1
of 1
William 1
the 1
execution 1
of 1
Justine 1
the 1
murder 1
of 1
Clerval 1
and 1
lastly 1
of 1
my 1
wife 1
even 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
I 1
knew 1
not 1
that 1
my 1
only 1
remaining 1
friends 1
were 1
safe 1
from 1
the 1
malignity 1
of 1
the 1
fiend 1
my 1
father 1
even 1
now 1
might 1
be 1
writhing 1
under 1
his 1
grasp 1
and 1
Ernest 1
might 1
be 1
dead 1
at 1
his 1
feet 1
This 1
idea 1
made 1
me 1
shudder 1
and 1
recalled 1
me 1
to 1
action 1
I 1
started 1
up 1
and 1
resolved 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
Geneva 1
with 1
all 1
possible 1
speed 1
There 1
were 1
no 1
horses 1
to 1
be 1
procured 1
and 1
I 1
must 1
return 1
by 1
the 1
lake 1
but 1
the 1
wind 1
was 1
unfavourable 1
and 1
the 1
rain 1
fell 1
in 1
torrents 1
However 1
it 1
was 1
hardly 1
morning 1
and 1
I 1
might 1
reasonably 1
hope 1
to 1
arrive 1
by 1
night 1
I 1
hired 1
men 1
to 1
row 1
and 1
took 1
an 1
oar 1
myself 1
for 1
I 1
had 1
always 1
experienced 1
relief 1
from 1
mental 1
torment 1
in 1
bodily 1
exercise 1
But 1
the 1
overflowing 1
misery 1
I 1
now 1
felt 1
and 1
the 1
excess 1
of 1
agitation 1
that 1
I 1
endured 1
rendered 1
me 1
incapable 1
of 1
any 1
exertion 1
I 1
threw 1
down 1
the 1
oar 1
and 1
leaning 1
my 1
head 1
upon 1
my 1
hands 1
gave 1
way 1
to 1
every 1
gloomy 1
idea 1
that 1
arose 1
If 1
I 1
looked 1
up 1
I 1
saw 1
scenes 1
which 1
were 1
familiar 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
happier 1
time 1
and 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
contemplated 1
but 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
in 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
her 1
who 1
was 1
now 1
but 1
a 1
shadow 1
and 1
a 1
recollection 1
Tears 1
streamed 1
from 1
my 1
eyes 1
The 1
rain 1
had 1
ceased 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
fish 1
play 1
in 1
the 1
waters 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
done 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
before 1
they 1
had 1
then 1
been 1
observed 1
by 1
Elizabeth 1
Nothing 1
is 1
so 1
painful 1
to 1
the 1
human 1
mind 1
as 1
a 1
great 1
and 1
sudden 1
change 1
The 1
sun 1
might 1
shine 1
or 1
the 1
clouds 1
might 1
lower 1
but 1
nothing 1
could 1
appear 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
it 1
had 1
done 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
A 1
fiend 1
had 1
snatched 1
from 1
me 1
every 1
hope 1
of 1
future 1
happiness 1
no 1
creature 1
had 1
ever 1
been 1
so 1
miserable 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
frightful 1
an 1
event 1
is 1
single 1
in 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
man 1
But 1
why 1
should 1
I 1
dwell 1
upon 1
the 1
incidents 1
that 1
followed 1
this 1
last 1
overwhelming 1
event 1
Mine 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
tale 1
of 1
horrors 1
I 1
have 1
reached 1
their 1
acme 1
and 1
what 1
I 1
must 1
now 1
relate 1
can 1
but 1
be 1
tedious 1
to 1
you 1
Know 1
that 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
my 1
friends 1
were 1
snatched 1
away 1
I 1
was 1
left 1
desolate 1
My 1
own 1
strength 1
is 1
exhausted 1
and 1
I 1
must 1
tell 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
what 1
remains 1
of 1
my 1
hideous 1
narration 1
I 1
arrived 1
at 1
Geneva 1
My 1
father 1
and 1
Ernest 1
yet 1
lived 1
but 1
the 1
former 1
sunk 1
under 1
the 1
tidings 1
that 1
I 1
bore 1
I 1
see 1
him 1
now 1
excellent 1
and 1
venerable 1
old 1
man 1
His 1
eyes 1
wandered 1
in 1
vacancy 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
lost 1
their 1
charm 1
and 1
their 1
delight 1
his 1
Elizabeth 1
his 1
more 1
than 1
daughter 1
whom 1
he 1
doted 1
on 1
with 1
all 1
that 1
affection 1
which 1
a 1
man 1
feels 1
who 1
in 1
the 1
decline 1
of 1
life 1
having 1
few 1
affections 1
clings 1
more 1
earnestly 1
to 1
those 1
that 1
remain 1
Cursed 1
cursed 1
be 1
the 1
fiend 1
that 1
brought 1
misery 1
on 1
his 1
grey 1
hairs 1
and 1
doomed 1
him 1
to 1
waste 1
in 1
wretchedness 1
He 1
could 1
not 1
live 1
under 1
the 1
horrors 1
that 1
were 1
accumulated 1
around 1
him 1
the 1
springs 1
of 1
existence 1
suddenly 1
gave 1
way 1
he 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
rise 1
from 1
his 1
bed 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
he 1
died 1
in 1
my 1
arms 1
What 1
then 1
became 1
of 1
me 1
I 1
know 1
not 1
I 1
lost 1
sensation 1
and 1
chains 1
and 1
darkness 1
were 1
the 1
only 1
objects 1
that 1
pressed 1
upon 1
me 1
Sometimes 1
indeed 1
I 1
dreamt 1
that 1
I 1
wandered 1
in 1
flowery 1
meadows 1
and 1
pleasant 1
vales 1
with 1
the 1
friends 1
of 1
my 1
youth 1
but 1
I 1
awoke 1
and 1
found 1
myself 1
in 1
a 1
dungeon 1
Melancholy 1
followed 1
but 1
by 1
degrees 1
I 1
gained 1
a 1
clear 1
conception 1
of 1
my 1
miseries 1
and 1
situation 1
and 1
was 1
then 1
released 1
from 1
my 1
prison 1
For 1
they 1
had 1
called 1
me 1
mad 1
and 1
during 1
many 1
months 1
as 1
I 1
understood 1
a 1
solitary 1
cell 1
had 1
been 1
my 1
habitation 1
Liberty 1
however 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
useless 1
gift 1
to 1
me 1
had 1
I 1
not 1
as 1
I 1
awakened 1
to 1
reason 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
awakened 1
to 1
revenge 1
As 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
past 1
misfortunes 1
pressed 1
upon 1
me 1
I 1
began 1
to 1
reflect 1
on 1
their 1
cause 1
the 1
monster 1
whom 1
I 1
had 1
created 1
the 1
miserable 1
daemon 1
whom 1
I 1
had 1
sent 1
abroad 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
for 1
my 1
destruction 1
I 1
was 1
possessed 1
by 1
a 1
maddening 1
rage 1
when 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
desired 1
and 1
ardently 1
prayed 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
have 1
him 1
within 1
my 1
grasp 1
to 1
wreak 1
a 1
great 1
and 1
signal 1
revenge 1
on 1
his 1
cursed 1
head 1
Nor 1
did 1
my 1
hate 1
long 1
confine 1
itself 1
to 1
useless 1
wishes 1
I 1
began 1
to 1
reflect 1
on 1
the 1
best 1
means 1
of 1
securing 1
him 1
and 1
for 1
this 1
purpose 1
about 1
a 1
month 1
after 1
my 1
release 1
I 1
repaired 1
to 1
a 1
criminal 1
judge 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
an 1
accusation 1
to 1
make 1
that 1
I 1
knew 1
the 1
destroyer 1
of 1
my 1
family 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
required 1
him 1
to 1
exert 1
his 1
whole 1
authority 1
for 1
the 1
apprehension 1
of 1
the 1
murderer 1
The 1
magistrate 1
listened 1
to 1
me 1
with 1
attention 1
and 1
kindness 1
Be 1
assured 1
sir 1
said 1
he 1
no 1
pains 1
or 1
exertions 1
on 1
my 1
part 1
shall 1
be 1
spared 1
to 1
discover 1
the 1
villain 1
I 1
thank 1
you 1
replied 1
I 1
listen 1
therefore 1
to 1
the 1
deposition 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
to 1
make 1
It 1
is 1
indeed 1
a 1
tale 1
so 1
strange 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
fear 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
credit 1
it 1
were 1
there 1
not 1
something 1
in 1
truth 1
which 1
however 1
wonderful 1
forces 1
conviction 1
The 1
story 1
is 1
too 1
connected 1
to 1
be 1
mistaken 1
for 1
a 1
dream 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
motive 1
for 1
falsehood 1
My 1
manner 1
as 1
I 1
thus 1
addressed 1
him 1
was 1
impressive 1
but 1
calm 1
I 1
had 1
formed 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
heart 1
a 1
resolution 1
to 1
pursue 1
my 1
destroyer 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
this 1
purpose 1
quieted 1
my 1
agony 1
and 1
for 1
an 1
interval 1
reconciled 1
me 1
to 1
life 1
I 1
now 1
related 1
my 1
history 1
briefly 1
but 1
with 1
firmness 1
and 1
precision 1
marking 1
the 1
dates 1
with 1
accuracy 1
and 1
never 1
deviating 1
into 1
invective 1
or 1
exclamation 1
The 1
magistrate 1
appeared 1
at 1
first 1
perfectly 1
incredulous 1
but 1
as 1
I 1
continued 1
he 1
became 1
more 1
attentive 1
and 1
interested 1
I 1
saw 1
him 1
sometimes 1
shudder 1
with 1
horror 1
at 1
others 1
a 1
lively 1
surprise 1
unmingled 1
with 1
disbelief 1
was 1
painted 1
on 1
his 1
countenance 1
When 1
I 1
had 1
concluded 1
my 1
narration 1
I 1
said 1
This 1
is 1
the 1
being 1
whom 1
I 1
accuse 1
and 1
for 1
whose 1
seizure 1
and 1
punishment 1
I 1
call 1
upon 1
you 1
to 1
exert 1
your 1
whole 1
power 1
It 1
is 1
your 1
duty 1
as 1
a 1
magistrate 1
and 1
I 1
believe 1
and 1
hope 1
that 1
your 1
feelings 1
as 1
a 1
man 1
will 1
not 1
revolt 1
from 1
the 1
execution 1
of 1
those 1
functions 1
on 1
this 1
occasion 1
This 1
address 1
caused 1
a 1
considerable 1
change 1
in 1
the 1
physiognomy 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
auditor 1
He 1
had 1
heard 1
my 1
story 1
with 1
that 1
half 1
kind 1
of 1
belief 1
that 1
is 1
given 1
to 1
a 1
tale 1
of 1
spirits 1
and 1
supernatural 1
events 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
called 1
upon 1
to 1
act 1
officially 1
in 1
consequence 1
the 1
whole 1
tide 1
of 1
his 1
incredulity 1
returned 1
He 1
however 1
answered 1
mildly 1
I 1
would 1
willingly 1
afford 1
you 1
every 1
aid 1
in 1
your 1
pursuit 1
but 1
the 1
creature 1
of 1
whom 1
you 1
speak 1
appears 1
to 1
have 1
powers 1
which 1
would 1
put 1
all 1
my 1
exertions 1
to 1
defiance 1
Who 1
can 1
follow 1
an 1
animal 1
which 1
can 1
traverse 1
the 1
sea 1
of 1
ice 1
and 1
inhabit 1
caves 1
and 1
dens 1
where 1
no 1
man 1
would 1
venture 1
to 1
intrude 1
Besides 1
some 1
months 1
have 1
elapsed 1
since 1
the 1
commission 1
of 1
his 1
crimes 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
conjecture 1
to 1
what 1
place 1
he 1
has 1
wandered 1
or 1
what 1
region 1
he 1
may 1
now 1
inhabit 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
doubt 1
that 1
he 1
hovers 1
near 1
the 1
spot 1
which 1
I 1
inhabit 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
has 1
indeed 1
taken 1
refuge 1
in 1
the 1
Alps 1
he 1
may 1
be 1
hunted 1
like 1
the 1
chamois 1
and 1
destroyed 1
as 1
a 1
beast 1
of 1
prey 1
But 1
I 1
perceive 1
your 1
thoughts 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
credit 1
my 1
narrative 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
intend 1
to 1
pursue 1
my 1
enemy 1
with 1
the 1
punishment 1
which 1
is 1
his 1
desert 1
As 1
I 1
spoke 1
rage 1
sparkled 1
in 1
my 1
eyes 1
the 1
magistrate 1
was 1
intimidated 1
You 1
are 1
mistaken 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
will 1
exert 1
myself 1
and 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
to 1
seize 1
the 1
monster 1
be 1
assured 1
that 1
he 1
shall 1
suffer 1
punishment 1
proportionate 1
to 1
his 1
crimes 1
But 1
I 1
fear 1
from 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
yourself 1
described 1
to 1
be 1
his 1
properties 1
that 1
this 1
will 1
prove 1
impracticable 1
and 1
thus 1
while 1
every 1
proper 1
measure 1
is 1
pursued 1
you 1
should 1
make 1
up 1
your 1
mind 1
to 1
disappointment 1
That 1
cannot 1
be 1
but 1
all 1
that 1
I 1
can 1
say 1
will 1
be 1
of 1
little 1
avail 1
My 1
revenge 1
is 1
of 1
no 1
moment 1
to 1
you 1
yet 1
while 1
I 1
allow 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
vice 1
I 1
confess 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
devouring 1
and 1
only 1
passion 1
of 1
my 1
soul 1
My 1
rage 1
is 1
unspeakable 1
when 1
I 1
reflect 1
that 1
the 1
murderer 1
whom 1
I 1
have 1
turned 1
loose 1
upon 1
society 1
still 1
exists 1
You 1
refuse 1
my 1
just 1
demand 1
I 1
have 1
but 1
one 1
resource 1
and 1
I 1
devote 1
myself 1
either 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
or 1
death 1
to 1
his 1
destruction 1
I 1
trembled 1
with 1
excess 1
of 1
agitation 1
as 1
I 1
said 1
this 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
frenzy 1
in 1
my 1
manner 1
and 1
something 1
I 1
doubt 1
not 1
of 1
that 1
haughty 1
fierceness 1
which 1
the 1
martyrs 1
of 1
old 1
are 1
said 1
to 1
have 1
possessed 1
But 1
to 1
a 1
Genevan 1
magistrate 1
whose 1
mind 1
was 1
occupied 1
by 1
far 1
other 1
ideas 1
than 1
those 1
of 1
devotion 1
and 1
heroism 1
this 1
elevation 1
of 1
mind 1
had 1
much 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
madness 1
He 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
soothe 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
nurse 1
does 1
a 1
child 1
and 1
reverted 1
to 1
my 1
tale 1
as 1
the 1
effects 1
of 1
delirium 1
Man 1
I 1
cried 1
how 1
ignorant 1
art 1
thou 1
in 1
thy 1
pride 1
of 1
wisdom 1
Cease 1
you 1
know 1
not 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
you 1
say 1
I 1
broke 1
from 1
the 1
house 1
angry 1
and 1
disturbed 1
and 1
retired 1
to 1
meditate 1
on 1
some 1
other 1
mode 1
of 1
action 1
Chapter 1
My 1
present 1
situation 1
was 1
one 1
in 1
which 1
all 1
voluntary 1
thought 1
was 1
swallowed 1
up 1
and 1
lost 1
I 1
was 1
hurried 1
away 1
by 1
fury 1
revenge 1
alone 1
endowed 1
me 1
with 1
strength 1
and 1
composure 1
it 1
moulded 1
my 1
feelings 1
and 1
allowed 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
calculating 1
and 1
calm 1
at 1
periods 1
when 1
otherwise 1
delirium 1
or 1
death 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
my 1
portion 1
My 1
first 1
resolution 1
was 1
to 1
quit 1
Geneva 1
forever 1
my 1
country 1
which 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
happy 1
and 1
beloved 1
was 1
dear 1
to 1
me 1
now 1
in 1
my 1
adversity 1
became 1
hateful 1
I 1
provided 1
myself 1
with 1
a 1
sum 1
of 1
money 1
together 1
with 1
a 1
few 1
jewels 1
which 1
had 1
belonged 1
to 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
departed 1
And 1
now 1
my 1
wanderings 1
began 1
which 1
are 1
to 1
cease 1
but 1
with 1
life 1
I 1
have 1
traversed 1
a 1
vast 1
portion 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
and 1
have 1
endured 1
all 1
the 1
hardships 1
which 1
travellers 1
in 1
deserts 1
and 1
barbarous 1
countries 1
are 1
wont 1
to 1
meet 1
How 1
I 1
have 1
lived 1
I 1
hardly 1
know 1
many 1
times 1
have 1
I 1
stretched 1
my 1
failing 1
limbs 1
upon 1
the 1
sandy 1
plain 1
and 1
prayed 1
for 1
death 1
But 1
revenge 1
kept 1
me 1
alive 1
I 1
dared 1
not 1
die 1
and 1
leave 1
my 1
adversary 1
in 1
being 1
When 1
I 1
quitted 1
Geneva 1
my 1
first 1
labour 1
was 1
to 1
gain 1
some 1
clue 1
by 1
which 1
I 1
might 1
trace 1
the 1
steps 1
of 1
my 1
fiendish 1
enemy 1
But 1
my 1
plan 1
was 1
unsettled 1
and 1
I 1
wandered 1
many 1
hours 1
round 1
the 1
confines 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
uncertain 1
what 1
path 1
I 1
should 1
pursue 1
As 1
night 1
approached 1
I 1
found 1
myself 1
at 1
the 1
entrance 1
of 1
the 1
cemetery 1
where 1
William 1
Elizabeth 1
and 1
my 1
father 1
reposed 1
I 1
entered 1
it 1
and 1
approached 1
the 1
tomb 1
which 1
marked 1
their 1
graves 1
Everything 1
was 1
silent 1
except 1
the 1
leaves 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
which 1
were 1
gently 1
agitated 1
by 1
the 1
wind 1
the 1
night 1
was 1
nearly 1
dark 1
and 1
the 1
scene 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
solemn 1
and 1
affecting 1
even 1
to 1
an 1
uninterested 1
observer 1
The 1
spirits 1
of 1
the 1
departed 1
seemed 1
to 1
flit 1
around 1
and 1
to 1
cast 1
a 1
shadow 1
which 1
was 1
felt 1
but 1
not 1
seen 1
around 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
mourner 1
The 1
deep 1
grief 1
which 1
this 1
scene 1
had 1
at 1
first 1
excited 1
quickly 1
gave 1
way 1
to 1
rage 1
and 1
despair 1
They 1
were 1
dead 1
and 1
I 1
lived 1
their 1
murderer 1
also 1
lived 1
and 1
to 1
destroy 1
him 1
I 1
must 1
drag 1
out 1
my 1
weary 1
existence 1
I 1
knelt 1
on 1
the 1
grass 1
and 1
kissed 1
the 1
earth 1
and 1
with 1
quivering 1
lips 1
exclaimed 1
By 1
the 1
sacred 1
earth 1
on 1
which 1
I 1
kneel 1
by 1
the 1
shades 1
that 1
wander 1
near 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
deep 1
and 1
eternal 1
grief 1
that 1
I 1
feel 1
I 1
swear 1
and 1
by 1
thee 1
O 1
Night 1
and 1
the 1
spirits 1
that 1
preside 1
over 1
thee 1
to 1
pursue 1
the 1
daemon 1
who 1
caused 1
this 1
misery 1
until 1
he 1
or 1
I 1
shall 1
perish 1
in 1
mortal 1
conflict 1
For 1
this 1
purpose 1
I 1
will 1
preserve 1
my 1
life 1
to 1
execute 1
this 1
dear 1
revenge 1
will 1
I 1
again 1
behold 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
tread 1
the 1
green 1
herbage 1
of 1
earth 1
which 1
otherwise 1
should 1
vanish 1
from 1
my 1
eyes 1
forever 1
And 1
I 1
call 1
on 1
you 1
spirits 1
of 1
the 1
dead 1
and 1
on 1
you 1
wandering 1
ministers 1
of 1
vengeance 1
to 1
aid 1
and 1
conduct 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
work 1
Let 1
the 1
cursed 1
and 1
hellish 1
monster 1
drink 1
deep 1
of 1
agony 1
let 1
him 1
feel 1
the 1
despair 1
that 1
now 1
torments 1
me 1
I 1
had 1
begun 1
my 1
adjuration 1
with 1
solemnity 1
and 1
an 1
awe 1
which 1
almost 1
assured 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
shades 1
of 1
my 1
murdered 1
friends 1
heard 1
and 1
approved 1
my 1
devotion 1
but 1
the 1
furies 1
possessed 1
me 1
as 1
I 1
concluded 1
and 1
rage 1
choked 1
my 1
utterance 1
I 1
was 1
answered 1
through 1
the 1
stillness 1
of 1
night 1
by 1
a 1
loud 1
and 1
fiendish 1
laugh 1
It 1
rang 1
on 1
my 1
ears 1
long 1
and 1
heavily 1
the 1
mountains 1
re 1
echoed 1
it 1
and 1
I 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
all 1
hell 1
surrounded 1
me 1
with 1
mockery 1
and 1
laughter 1
Surely 1
in 1
that 1
moment 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
possessed 1
by 1
frenzy 1
and 1
have 1
destroyed 1
my 1
miserable 1
existence 1
but 1
that 1
my 1
vow 1
was 1
heard 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
reserved 1
for 1
vengeance 1
The 1
laughter 1
died 1
away 1
when 1
a 1
well 1
known 1
and 1
abhorred 1
voice 1
apparently 1
close 1
to 1
my 1
ear 1
addressed 1
me 1
in 1
an 1
audible 1
whisper 1
I 1
am 1
satisfied 1
miserable 1
wretch 1
You 1
have 1
determined 1
to 1
live 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
satisfied 1
I 1
darted 1
towards 1
the 1
spot 1
from 1
which 1
the 1
sound 1
proceeded 1
but 1
the 1
devil 1
eluded 1
my 1
grasp 1
Suddenly 1
the 1
broad 1
disk 1
of 1
the 1
moon 1
arose 1
and 1
shone 1
full 1
upon 1
his 1
ghastly 1
and 1
distorted 1
shape 1
as 1
he 1
fled 1
with 1
more 1
than 1
mortal 1
speed 1
I 1
pursued 1
him 1
and 1
for 1
many 1
months 1
this 1
has 1
been 1
my 1
task 1
Guided 1
by 1
a 1
slight 1
clue 1
I 1
followed 1
the 1
windings 1
of 1
the 1
Rhone 1
but 1
vainly 1
The 1
blue 1
Mediterranean 1
appeared 1
and 1
by 1
a 1
strange 1
chance 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
fiend 1
enter 1
by 1
night 1
and 1
hide 1
himself 1
in 1
a 1
vessel 1
bound 1
for 1
the 1
Black 1
Sea 1
I 1
took 1
my 1
passage 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
ship 1
but 1
he 1
escaped 1
I 1
know 1
not 1
how 1
Amidst 1
the 1
wilds 1
of 1
Tartary 1
and 1
Russia 1
although 1
he 1
still 1
evaded 1
me 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
followed 1
in 1
his 1
track 1
Sometimes 1
the 1
peasants 1
scared 1
by 1
this 1
horrid 1
apparition 1
informed 1
me 1
of 1
his 1
path 1
sometimes 1
he 1
himself 1
who 1
feared 1
that 1
if 1
I 1
lost 1
all 1
trace 1
of 1
him 1
I 1
should 1
despair 1
and 1
die 1
left 1
some 1
mark 1
to 1
guide 1
me 1
The 1
snows 1
descended 1
on 1
my 1
head 1
and 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
print 1
of 1
his 1
huge 1
step 1
on 1
the 1
white 1
plain 1
To 1
you 1
first 1
entering 1
on 1
life 1
to 1
whom 1
care 1
is 1
new 1
and 1
agony 1
unknown 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
understand 1
what 1
I 1
have 1
felt 1
and 1
still 1
feel 1
Cold 1
want 1
and 1
fatigue 1
were 1
the 1
least 1
pains 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
destined 1
to 1
endure 1
I 1
was 1
cursed 1
by 1
some 1
devil 1
and 1
carried 1
about 1
with 1
me 1
my 1
eternal 1
hell 1
yet 1
still 1
a 1
spirit 1
of 1
good 1
followed 1
and 1
directed 1
my 1
steps 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
most 1
murmured 1
would 1
suddenly 1
extricate 1
me 1
from 1
seemingly 1
insurmountable 1
difficulties 1
Sometimes 1
when 1
nature 1
overcome 1
by 1
hunger 1
sank 1
under 1
the 1
exhaustion 1
a 1
repast 1
was 1
prepared 1
for 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
desert 1
that 1
restored 1
and 1
inspirited 1
me 1
The 1
fare 1
was 1
indeed 1
coarse 1
such 1
as 1
the 1
peasants 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
ate 1
but 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
doubt 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
set 1
there 1
by 1
the 1
spirits 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
invoked 1
to 1
aid 1
me 1
Often 1
when 1
all 1
was 1
dry 1
the 1
heavens 1
cloudless 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
parched 1
by 1
thirst 1
a 1
slight 1
cloud 1
would 1
bedim 1
the 1
sky 1
shed 1
the 1
few 1
drops 1
that 1
revived 1
me 1
and 1
vanish 1
I 1
followed 1
when 1
I 1
could 1
the 1
courses 1
of 1
the 1
rivers 1
but 1
the 1
daemon 1
generally 1
avoided 1
these 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
here 1
that 1
the 1
population 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
chiefly 1
collected 1
In 1
other 1
places 1
human 1
beings 1
were 1
seldom 1
seen 1
and 1
I 1
generally 1
subsisted 1
on 1
the 1
wild 1
animals 1
that 1
crossed 1
my 1
path 1
I 1
had 1
money 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
gained 1
the 1
friendship 1
of 1
the 1
villagers 1
by 1
distributing 1
it 1
or 1
I 1
brought 1
with 1
me 1
some 1
food 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
killed 1
which 1
after 1
taking 1
a 1
small 1
part 1
I 1
always 1
presented 1
to 1
those 1
who 1
had 1
provided 1
me 1
with 1
fire 1
and 1
utensils 1
for 1
cooking 1
My 1
life 1
as 1
it 1
passed 1
thus 1
was 1
indeed 1
hateful 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
during 1
sleep 1
alone 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
taste 1
joy 1
O 1
blessed 1
sleep 1
Often 1
when 1
most 1
miserable 1
I 1
sank 1
to 1
repose 1
and 1
my 1
dreams 1
lulled 1
me 1
even 1
to 1
rapture 1
The 1
spirits 1
that 1
guarded 1
me 1
had 1
provided 1
these 1
moments 1
or 1
rather 1
hours 1
of 1
happiness 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
retain 1
strength 1
to 1
fulfil 1
my 1
pilgrimage 1
Deprived 1
of 1
this 1
respite 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
sunk 1
under 1
my 1
hardships 1
During 1
the 1
day 1
I 1
was 1
sustained 1
and 1
inspirited 1
by 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
night 1
for 1
in 1
sleep 1
I 1
saw 1
my 1
friends 1
my 1
wife 1
and 1
my 1
beloved 1
country 1
again 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
benevolent 1
countenance 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
heard 1
the 1
silver 1
tones 1
of 1
my 1
Elizabeth 1
s 1
voice 1
and 1
beheld 1
Clerval 1
enjoying 1
health 1
and 1
youth 1
Often 1
when 1
wearied 1
by 1
a 1
toilsome 1
march 1
I 1
persuaded 1
myself 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
dreaming 1
until 1
night 1
should 1
come 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
then 1
enjoy 1
reality 1
in 1
the 1
arms 1
of 1
my 1
dearest 1
friends 1
What 1
agonizing 1
fondness 1
did 1
I 1
feel 1
for 1
them 1
How 1
did 1
I 1
cling 1
to 1
their 1
dear 1
forms 1
as 1
sometimes 1
they 1
haunted 1
even 1
my 1
waking 1
hours 1
and 1
persuade 1
myself 1
that 1
they 1
still 1
lived 1
At 1
such 1
moments 1
vengeance 1
that 1
burned 1
within 1
me 1
died 1
in 1
my 1
heart 1
and 1
I 1
pursued 1
my 1
path 1
towards 1
the 1
destruction 1
of 1
the 1
daemon 1
more 1
as 1
a 1
task 1
enjoined 1
by 1
heaven 1
as 1
the 1
mechanical 1
impulse 1
of 1
some 1
power 1
of 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
unconscious 1
than 1
as 1
the 1
ardent 1
desire 1
of 1
my 1
soul 1
What 1
his 1
feelings 1
were 1
whom 1
I 1
pursued 1
I 1
cannot 1
know 1
Sometimes 1
indeed 1
he 1
left 1
marks 1
in 1
writing 1
on 1
the 1
barks 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
or 1
cut 1
in 1
stone 1
that 1
guided 1
me 1
and 1
instigated 1
my 1
fury 1
My 1
reign 1
is 1
not 1
yet 1
over 1
these 1
words 1
were 1
legible 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
inscriptions 1
you 1
live 1
and 1
my 1
power 1
is 1
complete 1
Follow 1
me 1
I 1
seek 1
the 1
everlasting 1
ices 1
of 1
the 1
north 1
where 1
you 1
will 1
feel 1
the 1
misery 1
of 1
cold 1
and 1
frost 1
to 1
which 1
I 1
am 1
impassive 1
You 1
will 1
find 1
near 1
this 1
place 1
if 1
you 1
follow 1
not 1
too 1
tardily 1
a 1
dead 1
hare 1
eat 1
and 1
be 1
refreshed 1
Come 1
on 1
my 1
enemy 1
we 1
have 1
yet 1
to 1
wrestle 1
for 1
our 1
lives 1
but 1
many 1
hard 1
and 1
miserable 1
hours 1
must 1
you 1
endure 1
until 1
that 1
period 1
shall 1
arrive 1
Scoffing 1
devil 1
Again 1
do 1
I 1
vow 1
vengeance 1
again 1
do 1
I 1
devote 1
thee 1
miserable 1
fiend 1
to 1
torture 1
and 1
death 1
Never 1
will 1
I 1
give 1
up 1
my 1
search 1
until 1
he 1
or 1
I 1
perish 1
and 1
then 1
with 1
what 1
ecstasy 1
shall 1
I 1
join 1
my 1
Elizabeth 1
and 1
my 1
departed 1
friends 1
who 1
even 1
now 1
prepare 1
for 1
me 1
the 1
reward 1
of 1
my 1
tedious 1
toil 1
and 1
horrible 1
pilgrimage 1
As 1
I 1
still 1
pursued 1
my 1
journey 1
to 1
the 1
northward 1
the 1
snows 1
thickened 1
and 1
the 1
cold 1
increased 1
in 1
a 1
degree 1
almost 1
too 1
severe 1
to 1
support 1
The 1
peasants 1
were 1
shut 1
up 1
in 1
their 1
hovels 1
and 1
only 1
a 1
few 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
hardy 1
ventured 1
forth 1
to 1
seize 1
the 1
animals 1
whom 1
starvation 1
had 1
forced 1
from 1
their 1
hiding 1
places 1
to 1
seek 1
for 1
prey 1
The 1
rivers 1
were 1
covered 1
with 1
ice 1
and 1
no 1
fish 1
could 1
be 1
procured 1
and 1
thus 1
I 1
was 1
cut 1
off 1
from 1
my 1
chief 1
article 1
of 1
maintenance 1
The 1
triumph 1
of 1
my 1
enemy 1
increased 1
with 1
the 1
difficulty 1
of 1
my 1
labours 1
One 1
inscription 1
that 1
he 1
left 1
was 1
in 1
these 1
words 1
Prepare 1
Your 1
toils 1
only 1
begin 1
wrap 1
yourself 1
in 1
furs 1
and 1
provide 1
food 1
for 1
we 1
shall 1
soon 1
enter 1
upon 1
a 1
journey 1
where 1
your 1
sufferings 1
will 1
satisfy 1
my 1
everlasting 1
hatred 1
My 1
courage 1
and 1
perseverance 1
were 1
invigorated 1
by 1
these 1
scoffing 1
words 1
I 1
resolved 1
not 1
to 1
fail 1
in 1
my 1
purpose 1
and 1
calling 1
on 1
heaven 1
to 1
support 1
me 1
I 1
continued 1
with 1
unabated 1
fervour 1
to 1
traverse 1
immense 1
deserts 1
until 1
the 1
ocean 1
appeared 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
and 1
formed 1
the 1
utmost 1
boundary 1
of 1
the 1
horizon 1
Oh 1
How 1
unlike 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
the 1
blue 1
seasons 1
of 1
the 1
south 1
Covered 1
with 1
ice 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
to 1
be 1
distinguished 1
from 1
land 1
by 1
its 1
superior 1
wildness 1
and 1
ruggedness 1
The 1
Greeks 1
wept 1
for 1
joy 1
when 1
they 1
beheld 1
the 1
Mediterranean 1
from 1
the 1
hills 1
of 1
Asia 1
and 1
hailed 1
with 1
rapture 1
the 1
boundary 1
of 1
their 1
toils 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
weep 1
but 1
I 1
knelt 1
down 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
full 1
heart 1
thanked 1
my 1
guiding 1
spirit 1
for 1
conducting 1
me 1
in 1
safety 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
I 1
hoped 1
notwithstanding 1
my 1
adversary 1
s 1
gibe 1
to 1
meet 1
and 1
grapple 1
with 1
him 1
Some 1
weeks 1
before 1
this 1
period 1
I 1
had 1
procured 1
a 1
sledge 1
and 1
dogs 1
and 1
thus 1
traversed 1
the 1
snows 1
with 1
inconceivable 1
speed 1
I 1
know 1
not 1
whether 1
the 1
fiend 1
possessed 1
the 1
same 1
advantages 1
but 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
as 1
before 1
I 1
had 1
daily 1
lost 1
ground 1
in 1
the 1
pursuit 1
I 1
now 1
gained 1
on 1
him 1
so 1
much 1
so 1
that 1
when 1
I 1
first 1
saw 1
the 1
ocean 1
he 1
was 1
but 1
one 1
day 1
s 1
journey 1
in 1
advance 1
and 1
I 1
hoped 1
to 1
intercept 1
him 1
before 1
he 1
should 1
reach 1
the 1
beach 1
With 1
new 1
courage 1
therefore 1
I 1
pressed 1
on 1
and 1
in 1
two 1
days 1
arrived 1
at 1
a 1
wretched 1
hamlet 1
on 1
the 1
seashore 1
I 1
inquired 1
of 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
concerning 1
the 1
fiend 1
and 1
gained 1
accurate 1
information 1
A 1
gigantic 1
monster 1
they 1
said 1
had 1
arrived 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
armed 1
with 1
a 1
gun 1
and 1
many 1
pistols 1
putting 1
to 1
flight 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
of 1
a 1
solitary 1
cottage 1
through 1
fear 1
of 1
his 1
terrific 1
appearance 1
He 1
had 1
carried 1
off 1
their 1
store 1
of 1
winter 1
food 1
and 1
placing 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
sledge 1
to 1
draw 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
seized 1
on 1
a 1
numerous 1
drove 1
of 1
trained 1
dogs 1
he 1
had 1
harnessed 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
same 1
night 1
to 1
the 1
joy 1
of 1
the 1
horror 1
struck 1
villagers 1
had 1
pursued 1
his 1
journey 1
across 1
the 1
sea 1
in 1
a 1
direction 1
that 1
led 1
to 1
no 1
land 1
and 1
they 1
conjectured 1
that 1
he 1
must 1
speedily 1
be 1
destroyed 1
by 1
the 1
breaking 1
of 1
the 1
ice 1
or 1
frozen 1
by 1
the 1
eternal 1
frosts 1
On 1
hearing 1
this 1
information 1
I 1
suffered 1
a 1
temporary 1
access 1
of 1
despair 1
He 1
had 1
escaped 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
must 1
commence 1
a 1
destructive 1
and 1
almost 1
endless 1
journey 1
across 1
the 1
mountainous 1
ices 1
of 1
the 1
ocean 1
amidst 1
cold 1
that 1
few 1
of 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
could 1
long 1
endure 1
and 1
which 1
I 1
the 1
native 1
of 1
a 1
genial 1
and 1
sunny 1
climate 1
could 1
not 1
hope 1
to 1
survive 1
Yet 1
at 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
the 1
fiend 1
should 1
live 1
and 1
be 1
triumphant 1
my 1
rage 1
and 1
vengeance 1
returned 1
and 1
like 1
a 1
mighty 1
tide 1
overwhelmed 1
every 1
other 1
feeling 1
After 1
a 1
slight 1
repose 1
during 1
which 1
the 1
spirits 1
of 1
the 1
dead 1
hovered 1
round 1
and 1
instigated 1
me 1
to 1
toil 1
and 1
revenge 1
I 1
prepared 1
for 1
my 1
journey 1
I 1
exchanged 1
my 1
land 1
sledge 1
for 1
one 1
fashioned 1
for 1
the 1
inequalities 1
of 1
the 1
frozen 1
ocean 1
and 1
purchasing 1
a 1
plentiful 1
stock 1
of 1
provisions 1
I 1
departed 1
from 1
land 1
I 1
cannot 1
guess 1
how 1
many 1
days 1
have 1
passed 1
since 1
then 1
but 1
I 1
have 1
endured 1
misery 1
which 1
nothing 1
but 1
the 1
eternal 1
sentiment 1
of 1
a 1
just 1
retribution 1
burning 1
within 1
my 1
heart 1
could 1
have 1
enabled 1
me 1
to 1
support 1
Immense 1
and 1
rugged 1
mountains 1
of 1
ice 1
often 1
barred 1
up 1
my 1
passage 1
and 1
I 1
often 1
heard 1
the 1
thunder 1
of 1
the 1
ground 1
sea 1
which 1
threatened 1
my 1
destruction 1
But 1
again 1
the 1
frost 1
came 1
and 1
made 1
the 1
paths 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
secure 1
By 1
the 1
quantity 1
of 1
provision 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
consumed 1
I 1
should 1
guess 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
passed 1
three 1
weeks 1
in 1
this 1
journey 1
and 1
the 1
continual 1
protraction 1
of 1
hope 1
returning 1
back 1
upon 1
the 1
heart 1
often 1
wrung 1
bitter 1
drops 1
of 1
despondency 1
and 1
grief 1
from 1
my 1
eyes 1
Despair 1
had 1
indeed 1
almost 1
secured 1
her 1
prey 1
and 1
I 1
should 1
soon 1
have 1
sunk 1
beneath 1
this 1
misery 1
Once 1
after 1
the 1
poor 1
animals 1
that 1
conveyed 1
me 1
had 1
with 1
incredible 1
toil 1
gained 1
the 1
summit 1
of 1
a 1
sloping 1
ice 1
mountain 1
and 1
one 1
sinking 1
under 1
his 1
fatigue 1
died 1
I 1
viewed 1
the 1
expanse 1
before 1
me 1
with 1
anguish 1
when 1
suddenly 1
my 1
eye 1
caught 1
a 1
dark 1
speck 1
upon 1
the 1
dusky 1
plain 1
I 1
strained 1
my 1
sight 1
to 1
discover 1
what 1
it 1
could 1
be 1
and 1
uttered 1
a 1
wild 1
cry 1
of 1
ecstasy 1
when 1
I 1
distinguished 1
a 1
sledge 1
and 1
the 1
distorted 1
proportions 1
of 1
a 1
well 1
known 1
form 1
within 1
Oh 1
With 1
what 1
a 1
burning 1
gush 1
did 1
hope 1
revisit 1
my 1
heart 1
Warm 1
tears 1
filled 1
my 1
eyes 1
which 1
I 1
hastily 1
wiped 1
away 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
not 1
intercept 1
the 1
view 1
I 1
had 1
of 1
the 1
daemon 1
but 1
still 1
my 1
sight 1
was 1
dimmed 1
by 1
the 1
burning 1
drops 1
until 1
giving 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
emotions 1
that 1
oppressed 1
me 1
I 1
wept 1
aloud 1
But 1
this 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
time 1
for 1
delay 1
I 1
disencumbered 1
the 1
dogs 1
of 1
their 1
dead 1
companion 1
gave 1
them 1
a 1
plentiful 1
portion 1
of 1
food 1
and 1
after 1
an 1
hour 1
s 1
rest 1
which 1
was 1
absolutely 1
necessary 1
and 1
yet 1
which 1
was 1
bitterly 1
irksome 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
continued 1
my 1
route 1
The 1
sledge 1
was 1
still 1
visible 1
nor 1
did 1
I 1
again 1
lose 1
sight 1
of 1
it 1
except 1
at 1
the 1
moments 1
when 1
for 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
some 1
ice 1
rock 1
concealed 1
it 1
with 1
its 1
intervening 1
crags 1
I 1
indeed 1
perceptibly 1
gained 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
after 1
nearly 1
two 1
days 1
journey 1
I 1
beheld 1
my 1
enemy 1
at 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
mile 1
distant 1
my 1
heart 1
bounded 1
within 1
me 1
But 1
now 1
when 1
I 1
appeared 1
almost 1
within 1
grasp 1
of 1
my 1
foe 1
my 1
hopes 1
were 1
suddenly 1
extinguished 1
and 1
I 1
lost 1
all 1
trace 1
of 1
him 1
more 1
utterly 1
than 1
I 1
had 1
ever 1
done 1
before 1
A 1
ground 1
sea 1
was 1
heard 1
the 1
thunder 1
of 1
its 1
progress 1
as 1
the 1
waters 1
rolled 1
and 1
swelled 1
beneath 1
me 1
became 1
every 1
moment 1
more 1
ominous 1
and 1
terrific 1
I 1
pressed 1
on 1
but 1
in 1
vain 1
The 1
wind 1
arose 1
the 1
sea 1
roared 1
and 1
as 1
with 1
the 1
mighty 1
shock 1
of 1
an 1
earthquake 1
it 1
split 1
and 1
cracked 1
with 1
a 1
tremendous 1
and 1
overwhelming 1
sound 1
The 1
work 1
was 1
soon 1
finished 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
a 1
tumultuous 1
sea 1
rolled 1
between 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
enemy 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
left 1
drifting 1
on 1
a 1
scattered 1
piece 1
of 1
ice 1
that 1
was 1
continually 1
lessening 1
and 1
thus 1
preparing 1
for 1
me 1
a 1
hideous 1
death 1
In 1
this 1
manner 1
many 1
appalling 1
hours 1
passed 1
several 1
of 1
my 1
dogs 1
died 1
and 1
I 1
myself 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
sink 1
under 1
the 1
accumulation 1
of 1
distress 1
when 1
I 1
saw 1
your 1
vessel 1
riding 1
at 1
anchor 1
and 1
holding 1
forth 1
to 1
me 1
hopes 1
of 1
succour 1
and 1
life 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
conception 1
that 1
vessels 1
ever 1
came 1
so 1
far 1
north 1
and 1
was 1
astounded 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
I 1
quickly 1
destroyed 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
sledge 1
to 1
construct 1
oars 1
and 1
by 1
these 1
means 1
was 1
enabled 1
with 1
infinite 1
fatigue 1
to 1
move 1
my 1
ice 1
raft 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
your 1
ship 1
I 1
had 1
determined 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
going 1
southwards 1
still 1
to 1
trust 1
myself 1
to 1
the 1
mercy 1
of 1
the 1
seas 1
rather 1
than 1
abandon 1
my 1
purpose 1
I 1
hoped 1
to 1
induce 1
you 1
to 1
grant 1
me 1
a 1
boat 1
with 1
which 1
I 1
could 1
pursue 1
my 1
enemy 1
But 1
your 1
direction 1
was 1
northwards 1
You 1
took 1
me 1
on 1
board 1
when 1
my 1
vigour 1
was 1
exhausted 1
and 1
I 1
should 1
soon 1
have 1
sunk 1
under 1
my 1
multiplied 1
hardships 1
into 1
a 1
death 1
which 1
I 1
still 1
dread 1
for 1
my 1
task 1
is 1
unfulfilled 1
Oh 1
When 1
will 1
my 1
guiding 1
spirit 1
in 1
conducting 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
daemon 1
allow 1
me 1
the 1
rest 1
I 1
so 1
much 1
desire 1
or 1
must 1
I 1
die 1
and 1
he 1
yet 1
live 1
If 1
I 1
do 1
swear 1
to 1
me 1
Walton 1
that 1
he 1
shall 1
not 1
escape 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
seek 1
him 1
and 1
satisfy 1
my 1
vengeance 1
in 1
his 1
death 1
And 1
do 1
I 1
dare 1
to 1
ask 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
undertake 1
my 1
pilgrimage 1
to 1
endure 1
the 1
hardships 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
undergone 1
No 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
so 1
selfish 1
Yet 1
when 1
I 1
am 1
dead 1
if 1
he 1
should 1
appear 1
if 1
the 1
ministers 1
of 1
vengeance 1
should 1
conduct 1
him 1
to 1
you 1
swear 1
that 1
he 1
shall 1
not 1
live 1
swear 1
that 1
he 1
shall 1
not 1
triumph 1
over 1
my 1
accumulated 1
woes 1
and 1
survive 1
to 1
add 1
to 1
the 1
list 1
of 1
his 1
dark 1
crimes 1
He 1
is 1
eloquent 1
and 1
persuasive 1
and 1
once 1
his 1
words 1
had 1
even 1
power 1
over 1
my 1
heart 1
but 1
trust 1
him 1
not 1
His 1
soul 1
is 1
as 1
hellish 1
as 1
his 1
form 1
full 1
of 1
treachery 1
and 1
fiend 1
like 1
malice 1
Hear 1
him 1
not 1
call 1
on 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
William 1
Justine 1
Clerval 1
Elizabeth 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
wretched 1
Victor 1

thrust 1
your 1
sword 1
into 1

heart 1

near 1
and 1
direct 1
the 1

You 1
have 1
read 1
this 1
strange 1
and 1
terrific 1
story 1
Margaret 1
and 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
feel 1
your 1
blood 1
congeal 1
with 1
horror 1
like 1
that 1
which 1
even 1
now 1
curdles 1
mine 1
Sometimes 1
seized 1
with 1
sudden 1
agony 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
continue 1
his 1
tale 1
at 1
others 1
his 1
voice 1
broken 1
yet 1
piercing 1
uttered 1
with 1
difficulty 1
the 1
words 1
so 1
replete 1
with 1
anguish 1
His 1
fine 1
and 1
lovely 1
eyes 1
were 1
now 1
lighted 1
up 1
with 1
indignation 1
now 1
subdued 1
to 1
downcast 1
sorrow 1
and 1
quenched 1
in 1
infinite 1
wretchedness 1
Sometimes 1
he 1
commanded 1
his 1
countenance 1
and 1
tones 1
and 1
related 1
the 1
most 1
horrible 1
incidents 1
with 1
a 1
tranquil 1
voice 1
suppressing 1
every 1
mark 1
of 1
agitation 1
then 1
like 1
a 1
volcano 1
bursting 1
forth 1
his 1
face 1
would 1
suddenly 1
change 1
to 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
the 1
wildest 1
rage 1
as 1
he 1
shrieked 1
out 1
imprecations 1
on 1
his 1
persecutor 1
His 1
tale 1
is 1
connected 1
and 1
told 1
with 1
an 1
appearance 1
of 1
the 1
simplest 1
truth 1
yet 1
I 1
own 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
the 1
letters 1
of 1
Felix 1
and 1
Safie 1
which 1
he 1
showed 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
apparition 1
of 1
the 1
monster 1
seen 1
from 1
our 1
ship 1
brought 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
greater 1
conviction 1
of 1
the 1
truth 1
of 1
his 1
narrative 1
than 1
his 1
asseverations 1
however 1
earnest 1
and 1
connected 1
Such 1
a 1
monster 1
has 1
then 1
really 1
existence 1
I 1
cannot 1
doubt 1
it 1
yet 1
I 1
am 1
lost 1
in 1
surprise 1
and 1
admiration 1
Sometimes 1
I 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
gain 1
from 1
Frankenstein 1
the 1
particulars 1
of 1
his 1
creature 1
s 1
formation 1
but 1
on 1
this 1
point 1
he 1
was 1
impenetrable 1
Are 1
you 1
mad 1
my 1
friend 1
said 1
he 1
Or 1
whither 1
does 1
your 1
senseless 1
curiosity 1
lead 1
you 1
Would 1
you 1
also 1
create 1
for 1
yourself 1
and 1
the 1
world 1
a 1
demoniacal 1
enemy 1
Peace 1
peace 1
Learn 1
my 1
miseries 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
seek 1
to 1
increase 1
your 1
own 1
Frankenstein 1
discovered 1
that 1
I 1
made 1
notes 1
concerning 1
his 1
history 1
he 1
asked 1
to 1
see 1
them 1
and 1
then 1
himself 1
corrected 1
and 1
augmented 1
them 1
in 1
many 1
places 1
but 1
principally 1
in 1
giving 1
the 1
life 1
and 1
spirit 1
to 1
the 1
conversations 1
he 1
held 1
with 1
his 1
enemy 1
Since 1
you 1
have 1
preserved 1
my 1
narration 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
that 1
a 1
mutilated 1
one 1
should 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
posterity 1
Thus 1
has 1
a 1
week 1
passed 1
away 1
while 1
I 1
have 1
listened 1
to 1
the 1
strangest 1
tale 1
that 1
ever 1
imagination 1
formed 1
My 1
thoughts 1
and 1
every 1
feeling 1
of 1
my 1
soul 1
have 1
been 1
drunk 1
up 1
by 1
the 1
interest 1
for 1
my 1
guest 1
which 1
this 1
tale 1
and 1
his 1
own 1
elevated 1
and 1
gentle 1
manners 1
have 1
created 1
I 1
wish 1
to 1
soothe 1
him 1
yet 1
can 1
I 1
counsel 1
one 1
so 1
infinitely 1
miserable 1
so 1
destitute 1
of 1
every 1
hope 1
of 1
consolation 1
to 1
live 1
Oh 1
no 1
The 1
only 1
joy 1
that 1
he 1
can 1
now 1
know 1
will 1
be 1
when 1
he 1
composes 1
his 1
shattered 1
spirit 1
to 1
peace 1
and 1
death 1
Yet 1
he 1
enjoys 1
one 1
comfort 1
the 1
offspring 1
of 1
solitude 1
and 1
delirium 1
he 1
believes 1
that 1
when 1
in 1
dreams 1
he 1
holds 1
converse 1
with 1
his 1
friends 1
and 1
derives 1
from 1
that 1
communion 1
consolation 1
for 1
his 1
miseries 1
or 1
excitements 1
to 1
his 1
vengeance 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
not 1
the 1
creations 1
of 1
his 1
fancy 1
but 1
the 1
beings 1
themselves 1
who 1
visit 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
regions 1
of 1
a 1
remote 1
world 1
This 1
faith 1
gives 1
a 1
solemnity 1
to 1
his 1
reveries 1
that 1
render 1
them 1
to 1
me 1
almost 1
as 1
imposing 1
and 1
interesting 1
as 1
truth 1
Our 1
conversations 1
are 1
not 1
always 1
confined 1
to 1
his 1
own 1
history 1
and 1
misfortunes 1
On 1
every 1
point 1
of 1
general 1
literature 1
he 1
displays 1
unbounded 1
knowledge 1
and 1
a 1
quick 1
and 1
piercing 1
apprehension 1
His 1
eloquence 1
is 1
forcible 1
and 1
touching 1
nor 1
can 1
I 1
hear 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
relates 1
a 1
pathetic 1
incident 1
or 1
endeavours 1
to 1
move 1
the 1
passions 1
of 1
pity 1
or 1
love 1
without 1
tears 1
What 1
a 1
glorious 1
creature 1
must 1
he 1
have 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
days 1
of 1
his 1
prosperity 1
when 1
he 1
is 1
thus 1
noble 1
and 1
godlike 1
in 1
ruin 1
He 1
seems 1
to 1
feel 1
his 1
own 1
worth 1
and 1
the 1
greatness 1
of 1
his 1
fall 1
When 1
younger 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
believed 1
myself 1
destined 1
for 1
some 1
great 1
enterprise 1
My 1
feelings 1
are 1
profound 1
but 1
I 1
possessed 1
a 1
coolness 1
of 1
judgment 1
that 1
fitted 1
me 1
for 1
illustrious 1
achievements 1
This 1
sentiment 1
of 1
the 1
worth 1
of 1
my 1
nature 1
supported 1
me 1
when 1
others 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
oppressed 1
for 1
I 1
deemed 1
it 1
criminal 1
to 1
throw 1
away 1
in 1
useless 1
grief 1
those 1
talents 1
that 1
might 1
be 1
useful 1
to 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
When 1
I 1
reflected 1
on 1
the 1
work 1
I 1
had 1
completed 1
no 1
less 1
a 1
one 1
than 1
the 1
creation 1
of 1
a 1
sensitive 1
and 1
rational 1
animal 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
rank 1
myself 1
with 1
the 1
herd 1
of 1
common 1
projectors 1
But 1
this 1
thought 1
which 1
supported 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
commencement 1
of 1
my 1
career 1
now 1
serves 1
only 1
to 1
plunge 1
me 1
lower 1
in 1
the 1
dust 1
All 1
my 1
speculations 1
and 1
hopes 1
are 1
as 1
nothing 1
and 1
like 1
the 1
archangel 1
who 1
aspired 1
to 1
omnipotence 1
I 1
am 1
chained 1
in 1
an 1
eternal 1
hell 1
My 1
imagination 1
was 1
vivid 1
yet 1
my 1
powers 1
of 1
analysis 1
and 1
application 1
were 1
intense 1
by 1
the 1
union 1
of 1
these 1
qualities 1
I 1
conceived 1
the 1
idea 1
and 1
executed 1
the 1
creation 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
Even 1
now 1
I 1
cannot 1
recollect 1
without 1
passion 1
my 1
reveries 1
while 1
the 1
work 1
was 1
incomplete 1
I 1
trod 1
heaven 1
in 1
my 1
thoughts 1
now 1
exulting 1
in 1
my 1
powers 1
now 1
burning 1
with 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
their 1
effects 1
From 1
my 1
infancy 1
I 1
was 1
imbued 1
with 1
high 1
hopes 1
and 1
a 1
lofty 1
ambition 1
but 1
how 1
am 1
I 1
sunk 1
Oh 1
My 1
friend 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
known 1
me 1
as 1
I 1
once 1
was 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
recognize 1
me 1
in 1
this 1
state 1
of 1
degradation 1
Despondency 1
rarely 1
visited 1
my 1
heart 1
a 1
high 1
destiny 1
seemed 1
to 1
bear 1
me 1
on 1
until 1
I 1
fell 1
never 2
again 1
to 1
rise 1
Must 1
I 1
then 1
lose 1
this 1
admirable 1
being 1
I 1
have 1
longed 1
for 1
a 1
friend 1
I 1
have 1
sought 1
one 1
who 1
would 1
sympathize 1
with 1
and 1
love 1
me 1
Behold 1
on 1
these 1
desert 1
seas 1
I 1
have 1
found 1
such 1
a 1
one 1
but 1
I 1
fear 1
I 1
have 1
gained 1
him 1
only 1
to 1
know 1
his 1
value 1
and 1
lose 1
him 1
I 1
would 1
reconcile 1
him 1
to 1
life 1
but 1
he 1
repulses 1
the 1
idea 1
I 1
thank 1
you 1
Walton 1
he 1
said 1
for 1
your 1
kind 1
intentions 1
towards 1
so 1
miserable 1
a 1
wretch 1
but 1
when 1
you 1
speak 1
of 1
new 1
ties 1
and 1
fresh 1
affections 1
think 1
you 1
that 1
any 1
can 1
replace 1
those 1
who 1
are 1
gone 1
Can 1
any 1
man 1
be 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
Clerval 1
was 1
or 1
any 1
woman 1
another 1
Elizabeth 1
Even 1
where 1
the 1
affections 1
are 1
not 1
strongly 1
moved 1
by 1
any 1
superior 1
excellence 1
the 1
companions 1
of 1
our 1
childhood 1
always 1
possess 1
a 1
certain 1
power 1
over 1
our 1
minds 1
which 1
hardly 1
any 1
later 1
friend 1
can 1
obtain 1
They 1
know 1
our 1
infantine 1
dispositions 1
which 1
however 1
they 1
may 1
be 1
afterwards 1
modified 1
are 1
never 1
eradicated 1
and 1
they 1
can 1
judge 1
of 1
our 1
actions 1
with 1
more 1
certain 1
conclusions 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
integrity 1
of 1
our 1
motives 1
A 1
sister 1
or 1
a 1
brother 1
can 1
never 1
unless 1
indeed 1
such 1
symptoms 1
have 1
been 1
shown 1
early 1
suspect 1
the 1
other 1
of 1
fraud 1
or 1
false 1
dealing 1
when 1
another 1
friend 1
however 1
strongly 1
he 1
may 1
be 1
attached 1
may 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
himself 1
be 1
contemplated 1
with 1
suspicion 1
But 1
I 1
enjoyed 1
friends 1
dear 1
not 1
only 1
through 1
habit 1
and 1
association 1
but 1
from 1
their 1
own 1
merits 1
and 1
wherever 1
I 1
am 1
the 1
soothing 1
voice 1
of 1
my 1
Elizabeth 1
and 1
the 1
conversation 1
of 1
Clerval 1
will 1
be 1
ever 1
whispered 1
in 1
my 1
ear 1
They 1
are 1
dead 1
and 1
but 1
one 1
feeling 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
solitude 1
can 1
persuade 1
me 1
to 1
preserve 1
my 1
life 1
If 1
I 1
were 1
engaged 1
in 1
any 1
high 1
undertaking 1
or 1
design 1
fraught 1
with 1
extensive 1
utility 1
to 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
then 1
could 1
I 1
live 1
to 1
fulfil 1
it 1
But 1
such 1
is 1
not 1
my 1
destiny 1
I 1
must 1
pursue 1
and 1
destroy 1
the 1
being 1
to 1
whom 1
I 1
gave 1
existence 1
then 1
my 1
lot 1
on 1
earth 1
will 1
be 1
fulfilled 1
and 1
I 1
may 1
die 1
September 1
nd 1
My 1
beloved 1
Sister 1
I 1
write 1
to 1
you 1
encompassed 1
by 1
peril 1
and 1
ignorant 1
whether 1
I 1
am 1
ever 1
doomed 1
to 1
see 1
again 1
dear 1
England 1
and 1
the 1
dearer 1
friends 1
that 1
inhabit 1
it 1
I 1
am 1
surrounded 1
by 1
mountains 1
of 1
ice 1
which 1
admit 1
of 1
no 1
escape 1
and 1
threaten 1
every 1
moment 1
to 1
crush 1
my 1
vessel 1
The 1
brave 1
fellows 1
whom 1
I 1
have 1
persuaded 1
to 1
be 1
my 1
companions 1
look 1
towards 1
me 1
for 1
aid 1
but 1
I 1
have 1
none 1
to 1
bestow 1
There 1
is 1
something 1
terribly 1
appalling 1
in 1
our 1
situation 1
yet 1
my 1
courage 1
and 1
hopes 1
do 1
not 1
desert 1
me 1
Yet 1
it 1
is 1
terrible 1
to 1
reflect 1
that 1
the 1
lives 1
of 1
all 1
these 1
men 1
are 1
endangered 1
through 1
me 1
If 1
we 1
are 1
lost 1
my 1
mad 1
schemes 1
are 1
the 1
cause 1
And 1
what 1
Margaret 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
state 1
of 1
your 1
mind 1
You 1
will 1
not 1
hear 1
of 1
my 1
destruction 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
anxiously 1
await 1
my 1
return 1
Years 1
will 1
pass 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
visitings 1
of 1
despair 1
and 1
yet 1
be 1
tortured 1
by 1
hope 1
Oh 1
My 1
beloved 1
sister 1
the 1
sickening 1
failing 1
of 1
your 1
heart 1
felt 1
expectations 1
is 1
in 1
prospect 1
more 1
terrible 1
to 1
me 1
than 1
my 1
own 1
death 1
But 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
husband 1
and 1
lovely 1
children 1
you 1
may 1
be 1
happy 1
Heaven 1
bless 1
you 1
and 1
make 1
you 1
so 1
My 1
unfortunate 1
guest 1
regards 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
tenderest 1
compassion 1
He 1
endeavours 1
to 1
fill 1
me 1
with 1
hope 1
and 1
talks 1
as 1
if 1
life 1
were 1
a 1
possession 1
which 1
he 1
valued 1
He 1
reminds 1
me 1
how 1
often 1
the 1
same 1
accidents 1
have 1
happened 1
to 1
other 1
navigators 1
who 1
have 1
attempted 1
this 1
sea 1
and 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
myself 1
he 1
fills 1
me 1
with 1
cheerful 1
auguries 1
Even 1
the 1
sailors 1
feel 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
his 1
eloquence 1
when 1
he 1
speaks 1
they 1
no 1
longer 1
despair 1
he 1
rouses 1
their 1
energies 1
and 1
while 1
they 1
hear 1
his 1
voice 1
they 1
believe 1
these 1
vast 1
mountains 1
of 1
ice 1
are 1
mole 1
hills 1
which 1
will 1
vanish 1
before 1
the 1
resolutions 1
of 1
man 1
These 1
feelings 1
are 1
transitory 1
each 1
day 1
of 1
expectation 1
delayed 1
fills 1
them 1
with 1
fear 1
and 1
I 1
almost 1
dread 1
a 1
mutiny 1
caused 1
by 1
this 1
despair 1
September 1
th 1
A 1
scene 1
has 1
just 1
passed 1
of 1
such 1
uncommon 1
interest 1
that 1
although 1
it 1
is 1
highly 1
probable 1
that 1
these 1
papers 1
may 1
never 1
reach 1
you 1
yet 1
I 1
cannot 1
forbear 1
recording 1
it 1
We 1
are 1
still 1
surrounded 1
by 1
mountains 1
of 1
ice 1
still 1
in 1
imminent 1
danger 1
of 1
being 1
crushed 1
in 1
their 1
conflict 1
The 1
cold 1
is 1
excessive 1
and 1
many 1
of 1
my 1
unfortunate 1
comrades 1
have 1
already 1
found 1
a 1
grave 1
amidst 1
this 1
scene 1
of 1
desolation 1
Frankenstein 1
has 1
daily 1
declined 1
in 1
health 1
a 1
feverish 1
fire 1
still 1
glimmers 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
exhausted 1
and 1
when 1
suddenly 1
roused 1
to 1
any 1
exertion 1
he 1
speedily 1
sinks 1
again 1
into 1
apparent 1
lifelessness 1
I 1
mentioned 1
in 1
my 1
last 1
letter 1
the 1
fears 1
I 1
entertained 1
of 1
a 1
mutiny 1
This 1
morning 1
as 1
I 1
sat 1
watching 1
the 1
wan 1
countenance 1
of 1
my 1
friend 1
his 1
eyes 1
half 1
closed 1
and 1
his 1
limbs 1
hanging 1
listlessly 1
I 1
was 1
roused 1
by 1
half 1
a 1
dozen 1
of 1
the 1
sailors 1
who 1
demanded 1
admission 1
into 1
the 1
cabin 1
They 1
entered 1
and 1
their 1
leader 1
addressed 1
me 1
He 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
companions 1
had 1
been 1
chosen 1
by 1
the 1
other 1
sailors 1
to 1
come 1
in 1
deputation 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
make 1
me 1
a 1
requisition 1
which 1
in 1
justice 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
refuse 1
We 1
were 1
immured 1
in 1
ice 1
and 1
should 1
probably 1
never 1
escape 1
but 1
they 1
feared 1
that 1
if 1
as 1
was 1
possible 1
the 1
ice 1
should 1
dissipate 1
and 1
a 1
free 1
passage 1
be 1
opened 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
rash 1
enough 1
to 1
continue 1
my 1
voyage 1
and 1
lead 1
them 1
into 1
fresh 1
dangers 1
after 1
they 1
might 1
happily 1
have 1
surmounted 1
this 1
They 1
insisted 1
therefore 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
engage 1
with 1
a 1
solemn 1
promise 1
that 1
if 1
the 1
vessel 1
should 1
be 1
freed 1
I 1
would 1
instantly 1
direct 1
my 1
course 1
southwards 1
This 1
speech 1
troubled 1
me 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
despaired 1
nor 1
had 1
I 1
yet 1
conceived 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
returning 1
if 1
set 1
free 1
Yet 1
could 1
I 1
in 1
justice 1
or 1
even 1
in 1
possibility 1
refuse 1
this 1
demand 1
I 1
hesitated 1
before 1
I 1
answered 1
when 1
Frankenstein 1
who 1
had 1
at 1
first 1
been 1
silent 1
and 1
indeed 1
appeared 1
hardly 1
to 1
have 1
force 1
enough 1
to 1
attend 1
now 1
roused 1
himself 1
his 1
eyes 1
sparkled 1
and 1
his 1
cheeks 1
flushed 1
with 1
momentary 1
vigour 1
Turning 1
towards 1
the 1
men 1
he 1
said 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
demand 1
of 1
your 1
captain 1
Are 1
you 1
then 1
so 1
easily 1
turned 1
from 1
your 1
design 1
Did 1
you 1
not 1
call 1
this 1
a 1
glorious 1
expedition 1
And 1
wherefore 1
was 1
it 1
glorious 1
Not 1
because 1
the 1
way 1
was 1
smooth 1
and 1
placid 1
as 1
a 1
southern 1
sea 1
but 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
dangers 1
and 1
terror 1
because 1
at 1
every 1
new 1
incident 1
your 1
fortitude 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
called 1
forth 1
and 1
your 1
courage 1
exhibited 1
because 1
danger 1
and 1
death 1
surrounded 1
it 1
and 1
these 1
you 1
were 1
to 1
brave 1
and 1
overcome 1
For 1
this 1
was 1
it 1
a 1
glorious 1
for 1
this 1
was 1
it 1
an 1
honourable 1
undertaking 1
You 1
were 1
hereafter 1
to 1
be 1
hailed 1
as 1
the 1
benefactors 1
of 1
your 1
species 1
your 1
names 1
adored 1
as 1
belonging 1
to 1
brave 1
men 1
who 1
encountered 1
death 1
for 1
honour 1
and 1
the 1
benefit 1
of 1
mankind 1
And 1
now 1
behold 1
with 1
the 1
first 1
imagination 1
of 1
danger 1
or 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
the 1
first 1
mighty 1
and 1
terrific 1
trial 1
of 1
your 1
courage 1
you 1
shrink 1
away 1
and 1
are 1
content 1
to 1
be 1
handed 1
down 1
as 1
men 1
who 1
had 1
not 1
strength 1
enough 1
to 1
endure 1
cold 1
and 1
peril 1
and 1
so 1
poor 1
souls 1
they 1
were 1
chilly 1
and 1
returned 1
to 1
their 1
warm 1
firesides 1
Why 1
that 1
requires 1
not 1
this 1
preparation 1
ye 1
need 1
not 1
have 1
come 1
thus 1
far 1
and 1
dragged 1
your 1
captain 1
to 1
the 1
shame 1
of 1
a 1
defeat 1
merely 1
to 1
prove 1
yourselves 1
cowards 1
Oh 1
Be 1
men 1
or 1
be 1
more 1
than 1
men 1
Be 1
steady 1
to 1
your 1
purposes 1
and 1
firm 1
as 1
a 1
rock 1
This 1
ice 1
is 1
not 1
made 1
of 1
such 1
stuff 1
as 1
your 1
hearts 1
may 1
be 1
it 1
is 1
mutable 1
and 1
cannot 1
withstand 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
say 1
that 1
it 1
shall 1
not 1
Do 1
not 1
return 1
to 1
your 1
families 1
with 1
the 1
stigma 1
of 1
disgrace 1
marked 1
on 1
your 1
brows 1
Return 1
as 1
heroes 1
who 1
have 1
fought 1
and 1
conquered 1
and 1
who 1
know 1
not 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
turn 1
their 1
backs 1
on 1
the 1
foe 1
He 1
spoke 1
this 1
with 1
a 1
voice 1
so 1
modulated 1
to 1
the 1
different 1
feelings 1
expressed 1
in 1
his 1
speech 1
with 1
an 1
eye 1
so 1
full 1
of 1
lofty 1
design 1
and 1
heroism 1
that 1
can 1
you 1
wonder 1
that 1
these 1
men 1
were 1
moved 1
They 1
looked 1
at 1
one 1
another 1
and 1
were 1
unable 1
to 1
reply 1
I 1
spoke 1
I 1
told 1
them 1
to 1
retire 1
and 1
consider 1
of 1
what 1
had 1
been 1
said 1
that 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
lead 1
them 1
farther 1
north 1
if 1
they 1
strenuously 1
desired 1
the 1
contrary 1
but 1
that 1
I 1
hoped 1
that 1
with 1
reflection 1
their 1
courage 1
would 1
return 1
They 1
retired 1
and 1
I 1
turned 1
towards 1
my 1
friend 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
sunk 1
in 1
languor 1
and 1
almost 1
deprived 1
of 1
life 1
How 1
all 1
this 1
will 1
terminate 1
I 1
know 1
not 1
but 1
I 1
had 1
rather 1
die 1
than 1
return 1
shamefully 1
my 1
purpose 1
unfulfilled 1
Yet 1
I 1
fear 1
such 1
will 1
be 1
my 1
fate 1
the 1
men 1
unsupported 1
by 1
ideas 1
of 1
glory 1
and 1
honour 1
can 1
never 1
willingly 1
continue 1
to 1
endure 1
their 1
present 1
hardships 1
September 1
th 1
The 1
die 1
is 1
cast 1
I 1
have 1
consented 1
to 1
return 1
if 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
destroyed 1
Thus 1
are 1
my 1
hopes 1
blasted 1
by 1
cowardice 1
and 1
indecision 1
I 1
come 1
back 1
ignorant 1
and 1
disappointed 1
It 1
requires 1
more 1
philosophy 1
than 1
I 1
possess 1
to 1
bear 1
this 1
injustice 1
with 1
patience 1
September 1
th 1
It 1
is 1
past 1
I 1
am 1
returning 1
to 1
England 1
I 1
have 1
lost 1
my 1
hopes 1
of 1
utility 1
and 1
glory 1
I 1
have 1
lost 1
my 1
friend 1
But 1
I 1
will 1
endeavour 1
to 1
detail 1
these 1
bitter 1
circumstances 1
to 1
you 1
my 1
dear 1
sister 1
and 1
while 1
I 1
am 1
wafted 1
towards 1
England 1
and 1
towards 1
you 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
despond 1
September 1
th 1
the 1
ice 1
began 1
to 1
move 1
and 1
roarings 1
like 1
thunder 1
were 1
heard 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
as 1
the 1
islands 1
split 1
and 1
cracked 1
in 1
every 1
direction 1
We 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
imminent 1
peril 1
but 1
as 1
we 1
could 1
only 1
remain 1
passive 1
my 1
chief 1
attention 1
was 1
occupied 1
by 1
my 1
unfortunate 1
guest 1
whose 1
illness 1
increased 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
degree 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
entirely 1
confined 1
to 1
his 1
bed 1
The 1
ice 1
cracked 1
behind 1
us 1
and 1
was 1
driven 1
with 1
force 1
towards 1
the 1
north 1
a 1
breeze 1
sprang 1
from 1
the 1
west 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
th 1
the 1
passage 1
towards 1
the 1
south 1
became 1
perfectly 1
free 1
When 1
the 1
sailors 1
saw 1
this 1
and 1
that 1
their 1
return 1
to 1
their 1
native 1
country 1
was 1
apparently 1
assured 1
a 1
shout 1
of 1
tumultuous 1
joy 1
broke 1
from 1
them 1
loud 1
and 1
long 1
continued 1
Frankenstein 1
who 1
was 1
dozing 1
awoke 1
and 1
asked 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
the 1
tumult 1
They 1
shout 1
I 1
said 1
because 1
they 1
will 1
soon 1
return 1
to 1
England 1
Do 1
you 1
then 1
really 1
return 1
Alas 1
Yes 1
I 1
cannot 1
withstand 1
their 1
demands 1
I 1
cannot 1
lead 1
them 1
unwillingly 1
to 1
danger 1
and 1
I 1
must 1
return 1
Do 1
so 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
but 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
You 1
may 1
give 1
up 1
your 1
purpose 1
but 1
mine 1
is 1
assigned 1
to 1
me 1
by 1
heaven 1
and 1
I 1
dare 1
not 1
I 1
am 1
weak 1
but 1
surely 1
the 1
spirits 1
who 1
assist 1
my 1
vengeance 1
will 1
endow 1
me 1
with 1
sufficient 1
strength 1
Saying 1
this 1
he 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
spring 1
from 1
the 1
bed 1
but 1
the 1
exertion 1
was 1
too 1
great 1
for 1
him 1
he 1
fell 1
back 1
and 1
fainted 1
It 1
was 1
long 1
before 1
he 1
was 1
restored 1
and 1
I 1
often 1
thought 1
that 1
life 1
was 1
entirely 1
extinct 1
At 1
length 1
he 1
opened 1
his 1
eyes 1
he 1
breathed 1
with 1
difficulty 1
and 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
speak 1
The 1
surgeon 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
composing 1
draught 1
and 1
ordered 1
us 1
to 1
leave 1
him 1
undisturbed 1
In 1
the 1
meantime 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
my 1
friend 1
had 1
certainly 1
not 1
many 1
hours 1
to 1
live 1
His 1
sentence 1
was 1
pronounced 1
and 1
I 1
could 1
only 1
grieve 1
and 1
be 1
patient 1
I 1
sat 1
by 1
his 1
bed 1
watching 1
him 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
closed 1
and 1
I 1
thought 1
he 1
slept 1
but 1
presently 1
he 1
called 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
a 1
feeble 1
voice 1
and 1
bidding 1
me 1
come 1
near 1
said 1
Alas 1
The 1
strength 1
I 1
relied 1
on 1
is 1
gone 1
I 1
feel 1
that 1
I 1
shall 1
soon 1
die 1
and 1
he 1
my 1
enemy 1
and 1
persecutor 1
may 1
still 1
be 1
in 1
being 1
Think 1
not 1
Walton 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
last 1
moments 1
of 1
my 1
existence 1
I 1
feel 1
that 1
burning 1
hatred 1
and 1
ardent 1
desire 1
of 1
revenge 1
I 1
once 1
expressed 1
but 1
I 1
feel 1
myself 1
justified 1
in 1
desiring 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
my 1
adversary 1
During 1
these 1
last 1
days 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
occupied 1
in 1
examining 1
my 1
past 1
conduct 1
nor 1
do 1
I 1
find 1
it 1
blamable 1
In 1
a 1
fit 1
of 1
enthusiastic 1
madness 1
I 1
created 1
a 1
rational 1
creature 1
and 1
was 1
bound 1
towards 1
him 1
to 1
assure 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
was 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
his 1
happiness 1
and 1
well 1
being 1
This 1
was 1
my 1
duty 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
another 1
still 1
paramount 1
to 1
that 1
My 1
duties 1
towards 1
the 1
beings 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
species 1
had 1
greater 1
claims 1
to 1
my 1
attention 1
because 1
they 1
included 1
a 1
greater 1
proportion 1
of 1
happiness 1
or 1
misery 1
Urged 1
by 1
this 1
view 1
I 1
refused 1
and 1
I 1
did 1
right 1
in 1
refusing 1
to 1
create 1
a 1
companion 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
creature 1
He 1
showed 1
unparalleled 1
malignity 1
and 1
selfishness 1
in 1
evil 1
he 1
destroyed 1
my 1
friends 1
he 1
devoted 1
to 1
destruction 1
beings 1
who 1
possessed 1
exquisite 1
sensations 1
happiness 1
and 1
wisdom 1
nor 1
do 1
I 1
know 1
where 1
this 1
thirst 1
for 1
vengeance 1
may 1
end 1
Miserable 1
himself 1
that 1
he 1
may 1
render 1
no 1
other 1
wretched 1
he 1
ought 1
to 1
die 1
The 1
task 1
of 1
his 1
destruction 1
was 1
mine 1
but 1
I 1
have 1
failed 1
When 1
actuated 1
by 1
selfish 1
and 1
vicious 1
motives 1
I 1
asked 1
you 1
to 1
undertake 1
my 1
unfinished 1
work 1
and 1
I 1
renew 1
this 1
request 1
now 1
when 1
I 1
am 1
only 1
induced 1
by 1
reason 1
and 1
virtue 1
Yet 1
I 1
cannot 1
ask 1
you 1
to 1
renounce 1
your 1
country 1
and 1
friends 1
to 1
fulfil 1
this 1
task 1
and 1
now 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
returning 1
to 1
England 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
little 1
chance 1
of 1
meeting 1
with 1
him 1
But 1
the 1
consideration 1
of 1
these 1
points 1
and 1
the 1
well 1
balancing 1
of 1
what 1
you 1
may 1
esteem 1
your 1
duties 1
I 1
leave 1
to 1
you 1
my 1
judgment 1
and 1
ideas 1
are 1
already 1
disturbed 1
by 1
the 1
near 1
approach 1
of 1
death 1
I 1
dare 1
not 1
ask 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
what 1
I 1
think 1
right 1
for 1
I 1
may 1
still 1
be 1
misled 1
by 1
passion 1
That 1
he 1
should 1
live 1
to 1
be 1
an 1
instrument 1
of 1
mischief 1
disturbs 1
me 1
in 1
other 1
respects 1
this 1
hour 1
when 1
I 1
momentarily 1
expect 1
my 1
release 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
happy 1
one 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
enjoyed 1
for 1
several 1
years 1
The 1
forms 1
of 1
the 1
beloved 1
dead 1
flit 1
before 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
hasten 1
to 1
their 1
arms 1
Farewell 1
Walton 1
Seek 1
happiness 1
in 1
tranquillity 1
and 1
avoid 1
ambition 1
even 1
if 1
it 1
be 1
only 1
the 1
apparently 1
innocent 1
one 1
of 1
distinguishing 1
yourself 1
in 1
science 1
and 1
discoveries 1
Yet 1
why 1
do 1
I 1
say 1
this 1
I 1
have 1
myself 1
been 1
blasted 1
in 1
these 1
hopes 1
yet 1
another 1
may 1
succeed 1
His 1
voice 1
became 1
fainter 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
exhausted 1
by 1
his 1
effort 1
he 1
sank 1
into 1
silence 1
About 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
afterwards 1
he 1
attempted 1
again 1
to 1
speak 1
but 1
was 1
unable 1
he 1
pressed 1
my 1
hand 1
feebly 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
closed 1
forever 1
while 1
the 1
irradiation 1
of 1
a 1
gentle 1
smile 1
passed 1
away 1
from 1
his 1
lips 1
Margaret 1
what 1
comment 1
can 1
I 1
make 1
on 1
the 1
untimely 1
extinction 1
of 1
this 1
glorious 1
spirit 1
What 1
can 1
I 1
say 1
that 1
will 1
enable 1
you 1
to 1
understand 1
the 1
depth 1
of 1
my 1
sorrow 1
All 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
express 1
would 1
be 1
inadequate 1
and 1
feeble 1
My 1
tears 1
flow 1
my 1
mind 1
is 1
overshadowed 1
by 1
a 1
cloud 1
of 1
disappointment 1
But 1
I 1
journey 1
towards 1
England 1
and 1
I 1
may 1
there 1
find 1
consolation 1
I 1
am 1
interrupted 1
What 1
do 1
these 1
sounds 1
portend 1
It 1
is 1
midnight 1
the 1
breeze 1
blows 1
fairly 1
and 1
the 1
watch 1
on 1
deck 1
scarcely 1
stir 1
Again 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
sound 1
as 1
of 1
a 1
human 1
voice 1
but 1
hoarser 1
it 1
comes 1
from 1
the 1
cabin 1
where 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
Frankenstein 1
still 1
lie 1
I 1
must 1
arise 1
and 1
examine 1
Good 1
night 1
my 1
sister 1
Great 1
God 1
what 1
a 1
scene 1
has 1
just 1
taken 1
place 1
I 1
am 1
yet 1
dizzy 1
with 1
the 1
remembrance 1
of 1
it 1
I 1
hardly 1
know 1
whether 1
I 1
shall 1
have 1
the 1
power 1
to 1
detail 1
it 1
yet 1
the 1
tale 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
recorded 1
would 1
be 1
incomplete 1
without 1
this 1
final 1
and 1
wonderful 1
catastrophe 1
I 1
entered 1
the 1
cabin 1
where 1
lay 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
my 1
ill 1
fated 1
and 1
admirable 1
friend 1
Over 1
him 1
hung 1
a 1
form 1
which 1
I 1
cannot 1
find 1
words 1
to 1
describe 1
gigantic 1
in 1
stature 1
yet 1
uncouth 1
and 1
distorted 1
in 1
its 1
proportions 1
As 1
he 1
hung 1
over 1
the 1
coffin 1
his 1
face 1
was 1
concealed 1
by 1
long 1
locks 1
of 1
ragged 1
hair 1
but 1
one 1
vast 1
hand 1
was 1
extended 1
in 1
colour 1
and 1
apparent 1
texture 1
like 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
mummy 1
When 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
my 1
approach 1
he 1
ceased 1
to 1
utter 1
exclamations 1
of 1
grief 1
and 1
horror 1
and 1
sprung 1
towards 1
the 1
window 1
Never 1
did 1
I 1
behold 1
a 1
vision 1
so 1
horrible 1
as 1
his 1
face 1
of 1
such 1
loathsome 1
yet 1
appalling 1
hideousness 1
I 1
shut 1
my 1
eyes 1
involuntarily 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
recollect 1
what 1
were 1
my 1
duties 1
with 1
regard 1
to 1
this 1
destroyer 1
I 1
called 1
on 1
him 1
to 1
stay 1
He 1
paused 1
looking 1
on 1
me 1
with 1
wonder 1
and 1
again 1
turning 1
towards 1
the 1
lifeless 1
form 1
of 1
his 1
creator 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
forget 1
my 1
presence 1
and 1
every 1
feature 1
and 1
gesture 1
seemed 1
instigated 1
by 1
the 1
wildest 1
rage 1
of 1
some 1
uncontrollable 1
passion 1
That 1
is 1
also 1
my 1
victim 1
he 1
exclaimed 1
In 1
his 1
murder 1
my 1
crimes 1
are 1
consummated 1
the 1
miserable 1
series 1
of 1
my 1
being 1
is 1
wound 1
to 1
its 1
close 1
Oh 1
Frankenstein 1
Generous 1
and 1
self 1
devoted 1
being 1
What 1
does 1
it 1
avail 1
that 1
I 1
now 1
ask 1
thee 1
to 1
pardon 1
me 1
I 1
who 1
irretrievably 1
destroyed 1
thee 1
by 1
destroying 1
all 1
thou 1
lovedst 1
Alas 1
He 1
is 1
cold 1
he 1
cannot 1
answer 1
me 1
His 1
voice 1
seemed 1
suffocated 1
and 1
my 1
first 1
impulses 1
which 1
had 1
suggested 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
duty 1
of 1
obeying 1
the 1
dying 1
request 1
of 1
my 1
friend 1
in 1
destroying 1
his 1
enemy 1
were 1
now 1
suspended 1
by 1
a 1
mixture 1
of 1
curiosity 1
and 1
compassion 1
I 1
approached 1
this 1
tremendous 1
being 1
I 1
dared 1
not 1
again 1
raise 1
my 1
eyes 1
to 1
his 1
face 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
so 1
scaring 1
and 1
unearthly 1
in 1
his 1
ugliness 1
I 1
attempted 1
to 1
speak 1
but 1
the 1
words 1
died 1
away 1
on 1
my 1
lips 1
The 1
monster 1
continued 1
to 1
utter 1
wild 1
and 1
incoherent 1
self 1
reproaches 1
At 1
length 1
I 1
gathered 1
resolution 1
to 1
address 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
pause 1
of 1
the 1
tempest 1
of 1
his 1
passion 1
Your 1
repentance 1
I 1
said 1
is 1
now 1
superfluous 1
If 1
you 1
had 1
listened 1
to 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
conscience 1
and 1
heeded 1
the 1
stings 1
of 1
remorse 1
before 1
you 1
had 1
urged 1
your 1
diabolical 1
vengeance 1
to 1
this 1
extremity 1
Frankenstein 1
would 1
yet 1
have 1
lived 1
And 1
do 1
you 1
dream 1
said 1
the 1
daemon 1
Do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
then 1
dead 1
to 1
agony 1
and 1
remorse 1
He 1
he 1
continued 1
pointing 1
to 1
the 1
corpse 1
he 1
suffered 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
consummation 1
of 1
the 1
deed 1
Oh 1
Not 1
the 1
ten 1
thousandth 1
portion 1
of 1
the 1
anguish 1
that 1
was 1
mine 1
during 1
the 1
lingering 1
detail 1
of 1
its 1
execution 1
A 1
frightful 1
selfishness 1
hurried 1
me 1
on 1
while 1
my 1
heart 1
was 1
poisoned 1
with 1
remorse 1
Think 1
you 1
that 1
the 1
groans 1
of 1
Clerval 1
were 1
music 1
to 1
my 1
ears 1
My 1
heart 1
was 1
fashioned 1
to 1
be 1
susceptible 1
of 1
love 1
and 1
sympathy 1
and 1
when 1
wrenched 1
by 1
misery 1
to 1
vice 1
and 1
hatred 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
endure 1
the 1
violence 1
of 1
the 1
change 1
without 1
torture 1
such 1
as 1
you 1
cannot 1
even 1
imagine 1
After 1
the 1
murder 1
of 1
Clerval 1
I 1
returned 1
to 1
Switzerland 1
heart 1
broken 1
and 1
overcome 1
I 1
pitied 1
Frankenstein 1
my 1
pity 1
amounted 1
to 1
horror 1
I 1
abhorred 1
myself 1
But 1
when 1
I 1
discovered 1
that 1
he 1
the 1
author 1
at 1
once 1
of 1
my 1
existence 1
and 1
of 1
its 1
unspeakable 1
torments 1
dared 1
to 1
hope 1
for 1
happiness 1
that 1
while 1
he 1
accumulated 1
wretchedness 1
and 1
despair 1
upon 1
me 1
he 1
sought 1
his 1
own 1
enjoyment 1
in 1
feelings 1
and 1
passions 1
from 1
the 1
indulgence 1
of 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
forever 1
barred 1
then 1
impotent 1
envy 1
and 1
bitter 1
indignation 1
filled 1
me 1
with 1
an 1
insatiable 1
thirst 1
for 1
vengeance 1
I 1
recollected 1
my 1
threat 1
and 1
resolved 1
that 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
accomplished 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
preparing 1
for 1
myself 1
a 1
deadly 1
torture 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
the 1
slave 1
not 1
the 1
master 1
of 1
an 1
impulse 1
which 1
I 1
detested 1
yet 1
could 1
not 1
disobey 1
Yet 1
when 1
she 1
died 1
Nay 1
then 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
miserable 1
I 1
had 1
cast 1
off 1
all 1
feeling 1
subdued 1
all 1
anguish 1
to 1
riot 1
in 1
the 1
excess 1
of 1
my 1
despair 1
Evil 1
thenceforth 1
became 1
my 1
good 1
Urged 1
thus 1
far 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
choice 1
but 1
to 1
adapt 1
my 1
nature 1
to 1
an 1
element 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
willingly 1
chosen 1
The 1
completion 1
of 1
my 1
demoniacal 1
design 1
became 1
an 1
insatiable 1
passion 1
And 1
now 1
it 1
is 1
ended 1
there 1
is 1
my 1
last 1
victim 1
I 1
was 1
at 1
first 1
touched 1
by 1
the 1
expressions 1
of 1
his 1
misery 1
yet 1
when 1
I 1
called 1
to 1
mind 1
what 1
Frankenstein 1
had 1
said 1
of 1
his 1
powers 1
of 1
eloquence 1
and 1
persuasion 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
again 1
cast 1
my 1
eyes 1
on 1
the 1
lifeless 1
form 1
of 1
my 1
friend 1
indignation 1
was 1
rekindled 1
within 1
me 1
Wretch 1
I 1
said 1
It 1
is 1
well 1
that 1
you 1
come 1
here 1
to 1
whine 1
over 1
the 1
desolation 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
You 1
throw 1
a 1
torch 1
into 1
a 1
pile 1
of 1
buildings 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
are 1
consumed 1
you 1
sit 1
among 1
the 1
ruins 1
and 1
lament 1
the 1
fall 1
Hypocritical 1
fiend 1
If 1
he 1
whom 1
you 1
mourn 1
still 1
lived 1
still 1
would 1
he 1
be 1
the 1
object 1
again 1
would 1
he 1
become 1
the 1
prey 1
of 1
your 1
accursed 1
vengeance 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
pity 1
that 1
you 1
feel 1
you 1
lament 1
only 1
because 1
the 1
victim 1
of 1
your 1
malignity 1
is 1
withdrawn 1
from 1
your 1
power 1
Oh 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
thus 1
not 1
thus 1
interrupted 1
the 1
being 1
Yet 1
such 1
must 1
be 1
the 1
impression 1
conveyed 1
to 1
you 1
by 1
what 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
purport 1
of 1
my 1
actions 1
Yet 1
I 1
seek 1
not 1
a 1
fellow 1
feeling 1
in 1
my 1
misery 1
No 1
sympathy 1
may 1
I 1
ever 1
find 1
When 1
I 1
first 1
sought 1
it 2
was 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
virtue 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
happiness 1
and 1
affection 1
with 1
which 1
my 1
whole 1
being 1
overflowed 1
that 1
I 1
wished 1
to 1
be 1
participated 1
But 1
now 1
that 1
virtue 1
has 1
become 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
shadow 1
and 1
that 1
happiness 1
and 1
affection 1
are 1
turned 1
into 1
bitter 1
and 1
loathing 1
despair 1
in 1
what 1
should 1
I 1
seek 1
for 1
sympathy 1
I 1
am 1
content 1
to 1
suffer 1
alone 1
while 1
my 1
sufferings 1
shall 1
endure 1
when 1
I 1
die 1
I 1
am 1
well 1
satisfied 1
that 1
abhorrence 1
and 1
opprobrium 1
should 1
load 1
my 1
memory 1
Once 1
my 1
fancy 1
was 1
soothed 1
with 1
dreams 1
of 1
virtue 1
of 1
fame 1
and 1
of 1
enjoyment 1
Once 1
I 1
falsely 1
hoped 1
to 1
meet 1
with 1
beings 1
who 1
pardoning 1
my 1
outward 1
form 1
would 1
love 1
me 1
for 1
the 1
excellent 1
qualities 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
capable 1
of 1
unfolding 1
I 1
was 1
nourished 1
with 1
high 1
thoughts 1
of 1
honour 1
and 1
devotion 1
But 1
now 1
crime 1
has 1
degraded 1
me 1
beneath 1
the 1
meanest 1
animal 1
No 1
guilt 1
no 1
mischief 1
no 1
malignity 1
no 1
misery 1
can 1
be 1
found 1
comparable 1
to 1
mine 1
When 1
I 1
run 1
over 1
the 1
frightful 1
catalogue 1
of 1
my 1
sins 1
I 1
cannot 1
believe 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
the 1
same 1
creature 1
whose 1
thoughts 1
were 1
once 1
filled 1
with 1
sublime 1
and 1
transcendent 1
visions 1
of 1
the 1
beauty 1
and 1
the 1
majesty 1
of 1
goodness 1
But 1
it 1
is 1
even 1
so 1
the 1
fallen 1
angel 1
becomes 1
a 1
malignant 1
devil 1
Yet 1
even 1
that 1
enemy 1
of 1
God 1
and 1
man 1
had 1
friends 1
and 1
associates 1
in 1
his 1
desolation 1
I 1
am 1
alone 1
You 1
who 1
call 1
Frankenstein 1
your 1
friend 1
seem 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
knowledge 1
of 1
my 1
crimes 1
and 1
his 1
misfortunes 1
But 1
in 1
the 1
detail 1
which 1
he 1
gave 1
you 1
of 1
them 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
sum 1
up 1
the 1
hours 1
and 1
months 1
of 1
misery 1
which 1
I 1
endured 1
wasting 1
in 1
impotent 1
passions 1
For 1
while 1
I 1
destroyed 1
his 1
hopes 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
satisfy 1
my 1
own 1
desires 1
They 1
were 1
forever 1
ardent 1
and 1
craving 1
still 1
I 1
desired 1
love 1
and 1
fellowship 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
still 1
spurned 1
Was 1
there 1
no 1
injustice 1
in 1
this 1
Am 1
I 1
to 1
be 1
thought 1
the 1
only 1
criminal 1
when 1
all 1
humankind 1
sinned 1
against 1
me 1
Why 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
hate 1
Felix 1
who 1
drove 1
his 1
friend 1
from 1
his 1
door 1
with 1
contumely 1
Why 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
execrate 1
the 1
rustic 1
who 1
sought 1
to 1
destroy 1
the 1
saviour 1
of 1
his 1
child 1
Nay 1
these 1
are 1
virtuous 1
and 1
immaculate 1
beings 1
I 1
the 1
miserable 1
and 1
the 1
abandoned 1
am 1
an 1
abortion 1
to 1
be 1
spurned 1
at 1
and 1
kicked 1
and 1
trampled 1
on 1
Even 1
now 1
my 1
blood 1
boils 1
at 1
the 1
recollection 1
of 1
this 1
injustice 1
But 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
wretch 1
I 1
have 1
murdered 1
the 1
lovely 1
and 1
the 1
helpless 1
I 1
have 1
strangled 1
the 1
innocent 1
as 1
they 1
slept 1
and 1
grasped 1
to 1
death 1
his 1
throat 1
who 1
never 1
injured 1
me 1
or 1
any 1
other 1
living 1
thing 1
I 1
have 1
devoted 1
my 1
creator 1
the 1
select 1
specimen 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
worthy 1
of 1
love 1
and 1
admiration 1
among 1
men 1
to 1
misery 1
I 1
have 1
pursued 1
him 1
even 1
to 1
that 1
irremediable 1
ruin 1
There 1
he 1
lies 1
white 1
and 1
cold 1
in 1
death 1
You 1
hate 1
me 1
but 1
your 1
abhorrence 1
cannot 1
equal 1
that 1
with 1
which 1
I 1
regard 1
myself 1
I 1
look 1
on 1
the 1
hands 1
which 1
executed 1
the 1
deed 1
I 1
think 1
on 1
the 1
heart 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
imagination 1
of 1
it 1
was 1
conceived 1
and 1
long 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
when 1
these 1
hands 1
will 1
meet 1
my 1
eyes 1
when 1
that 1
imagination 1
will 1
haunt 1
my 1
thoughts 1
no 1
more 1
Fear 1
not 1
that 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
the 1
instrument 1
of 1
future 1
mischief 1
My 1
work 1
is 1
nearly 1
complete 1
Neither 1
yours 1
nor 1
any 1
man 1
s 1
death 1
is 1
needed 1
to 1
consummate 1
the 1
series 1
of 1
my 1
being 1
and 1
accomplish 1
that 1
which 1
must 1
be 1
done 1
but 1
it 1
requires 1
my 1
own 1
Do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
slow 1
to 1
perform 1
this 1
sacrifice 1
I 1
shall 1
quit 1
your 1
vessel 1
on 1
the 1
ice 1
raft 1
which 1
brought 1
me 1
thither 1
and 1
shall 1
seek 1
the 1
most 1
northern 1
extremity 1
of 1
the 1
globe 1
I 1
shall 1
collect 1
my 1
funeral 1
pile 1
and 1
consume 1
to 1
ashes 1
this 1
miserable 1
frame 1
that 1
its 1
remains 1
may 1
afford 1
no 1
light 1
to 1
any 1
curious 1
and 1
unhallowed 1
wretch 1
who 1
would 1
create 1
such 1
another 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
I 1
shall 1
die 1
I 1
shall 1
no 1
longer 1
feel 1
the 1
agonies 1
which 1
now 1
consume 1
me 1
or 1
be 1
the 1
prey 1
of 1
feelings 1
unsatisfied 1
yet 1
unquenched 1
He 1
is 1
dead 1
who 1
called 1
me 1
into 1
being 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
no 1
more 1
the 1
very 1
remembrance 1
of 1
us 1
both 1
will 1
speedily 1
vanish 1
I 1
shall 1
no 1
longer 1
see 1
the 1
sun 1
or 1
stars 1
or 1
feel 1
the 1
winds 1
play 1
on 1
my 1
cheeks 1
Light 1
feeling 1
and 1
sense 1
will 1
pass 1
away 1
and 1
in 1
this 1
condition 1
must 1
I 1
find 1
my 1
happiness 1
Some 1
years 1
ago 1
when 1
the 1
images 1
which 1
this 1
world 1
affords 1
first 1
opened 1
upon 1
me 1
when 1
I 1
felt 1
the 1
cheering 1
warmth 1
of 1
summer 1
and 1
heard 1
the 1
rustling 1
of 1
the 1
leaves 1
and 1
the 1
warbling 1
of 1
the 1
birds 1
and 1
these 1
were 1
all 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
wept 1
to 1
die 1
now 1
it 1
is 1
my 1
only 1
consolation 1
Polluted 1
by 1
crimes 1
and 1
torn 1
by 1
the 1
bitterest 1
remorse 1
where 1
can 1
I 1
find 1
rest 1
but 1
in 1
death 1
Farewell 1
I 1
leave 1
you 1
and 1
in 1
you 1
the 1
last 1
of 1
humankind 1
whom 1
these 1
eyes 1
will 1
ever 1
behold 1
Farewell 1
Frankenstein 1
If 1
thou 1
wert 1
yet 1
alive 1
and 1
yet 1
cherished 1
a 1
desire 1
of 1
revenge 1
against 1
me 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
better 1
satiated 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
than 1
in 1
my 1
destruction 1
But 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
so 1
thou 1
didst 1
seek 1
my 1
extinction 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
not 1
cause 1
greater 1
wretchedness 1
and 1
if 1
yet 1
in 1
some 1
mode 1
unknown 1
to 1
me 1
thou 1
hadst 1
not 1
ceased 1
to 1
think 1
and 1
feel 1
thou 1
wouldst 1
not 1
desire 1
against 1
me 1
a 1
vengeance 1
greater 1
than 1
that 1
which 1
I 1
feel 1
Blasted 1
as 1
thou 1
wert 1
my 1
agony 1
was 1
still 1
superior 1
to 1
thine 1
for 1
the 1
bitter 1
sting 1
of 1
remorse 1
will 1
not 1
cease 1
to 1
rankle 1
in 1
my 1
wounds 1
until 1
death 1
shall 1
close 1
them 1
forever 1
But 1
soon 1
he 1
cried 1
with 1
sad 1
and 1
solemn 1
enthusiasm 1
I 1
shall 1
die 1
and 1
what 1
I 1
now 1
feel 1
be 1
no 1
longer 1
felt 1
Soon 1
these 1
burning 1
miseries 1
will 1
be 1
extinct 1
I 1
shall 1
ascend 1
my 1
funeral 1
pile 1
triumphantly 1
and 1
exult 1
in 1
the 1
agony 1
of 1
the 1
torturing 1
flames 1
The 1
light 1
of 1
that 1
conflagration 1
will 1
fade 1
away 1
my 1
ashes 1
will 1
be 1
swept 1
into 1
the 1
sea 1
by 1
the 1
winds 1
My 1
spirit 1
will 1
sleep 1
in 1
peace 1
or 1
if 1
it 1
thinks 1
it 1
will 1
not 1
surely 1
think 1
thus 1
Farewell 1
He 1
sprang 1
from 1
the 1
cabin 1
window 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
this 1
upon 1
the 1
ice 1
raft 1
which 1
lay 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
vessel 1
He 1
was 1
soon 1
borne 1
away 1
by 1
the 1
waves 1
and 1
lost 1
in 1
darkness 1
and 1
distance 1
