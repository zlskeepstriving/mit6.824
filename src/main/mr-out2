THE 1
PREFACE 1
The 1
artist 1
is 1
the 1
creator 1
of 1
beautiful 1
things 1
To 1
reveal 1
art 1
and 1
conceal 1
the 1
artist 1
is 1
art 1
s 1
aim 1
The 1
critic 1
is 1
he 1
who 1
can 1
translate 1
into 1
another 1
manner 1
or 1
a 1
new 1
material 1
his 1
impression 1
of 1
beautiful 1
things 1
The 1
highest 1
as 1
the 1
lowest 1
form 1
of 1
criticism 1
is 1
a 1
mode 1
of 1
autobiography 1
Those 1
who 1
find 1
ugly 1
meanings 1
in 1
beautiful 1
things 1
are 1
corrupt 1
without 1
being 1
charming 1
This 1
is 1
a 1
fault 1
Those 1
who 1
find 1
beautiful 1
meanings 1
in 1
beautiful 1
things 1
are 1
the 1
cultivated 1
For 1
these 1
there 1
is 1
hope 1
They 1
are 1
the 1
elect 1
to 1
whom 1
beautiful 1
things 1
mean 1
only 1
beauty 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
such 1
thing 1
as 1
a 1
moral 1
or 1
an 1
immoral 1
book 1
Books 1
are 1
well 1
written 1
or 1
badly 1
written 1
That 1
is 1
all 1
The 1
nineteenth 1
century 1
dislike 1
of 1
realism 1
is 1
the 1
rage 1
of 1
Caliban 1
seeing 1
his 1
own 1
face 1
in 1
a 1
glass 1
The 1
nineteenth 1
century 1
dislike 1
of 1
romanticism 1
is 1
the 1
rage 1
of 1
Caliban 1
not 1
seeing 1
his 1
own 1
face 1
in 1
a 1
glass 1
The 1
moral 1
life 1
of 1
man 1
forms 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
subject 1
matter 1
of 1
the 1
artist 1
but 1
the 1
morality 1
of 1
art 1
consists 1
in 1
the 1
perfect 1
use 1
of 1
an 1
imperfect 1
medium 1
No 1
artist 1
desires 1
to 1
prove 1
anything 1
Even 1
things 1
that 1
are 1
true 1
can 1
be 1
proved 1
No 1
artist 1
has 1
ethical 1
sympathies 1
An 1
ethical 1
sympathy 1
in 1
an 1
artist 1
is 1
an 1
unpardonable 1
mannerism 1
of 1
style 1
No 1
artist 1
is 1
ever 1
morbid 1
The 1
artist 1
can 1
express 1
everything 1
Thought 1
and 1
language 1
are 1
to 1
the 1
artist 1
instruments 1
of 1
an 1
art 1
Vice 1
and 1
virtue 1
are 1
to 1
the 1
artist 1
materials 1
for 1
an 1
art 1
From 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
of 1
form 1
the 1
type 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
arts 1
is 1
the 1
art 1
of 1
the 1
musician 1
From 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
of 1
feeling 1
the 1
actor 1
s 1
craft 1
is 1
the 1
type 1
All 1
art 1
is 1
at 1
once 1
surface 1
and 1
symbol 1
Those 1
who 1
go 1
beneath 1
the 1
surface 1
do 1
so 1
at 1
their 1
peril 1
Those 1
who 1
read 1
the 1
symbol 1
do 1
so 1
at 1
their 1
peril 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
spectator 1
and 1
not 1
life 1
that 1
art 1
really 1
mirrors 1
Diversity 1
of 1
opinion 1
about 1
a 1
work 1
of 1
art 1
shows 1
that 1
the 1
work 1
is 1
new 1
complex 1
and 1
vital 1
When 1
critics 1
disagree 1
the 1
artist 1
is 1
in 1
accord 1
with 1
himself 1
We 1
can 1
forgive 1
a 1
man 1
for 1
making 1
a 1
useful 1
thing 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
he 1
does 1
not 1
admire 1
it 1
The 1
only 1
excuse 1
for 1
making 1
a 1
useless 1
thing 1
is 1
that 1
one 1
admires 1
it 1
intensely 1
All 1
art 1
is 1
quite 1
useless 1

CHAPTER 1
The 1
studio 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
the 1
rich 1
odour 1
of 1
roses 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
light 1
summer 1
wind 1
stirred 1
amidst 1
the 1
trees 1
of 1
the 1
garden 1
there 1
came 1
through 1
the 1
open 1
door 1
the 1
heavy 1
scent 1
of 1
the 1
lilac 1
or 1
the 1
more 1
delicate 1
perfume 1
of 1
the 1
pink 1
flowering 1
thorn 1
From 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
divan 1
of 1
Persian 1
saddle 1
bags 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
lying 1
smoking 1
as 1
was 1
his 1
custom 1
innumerable 1
cigarettes 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Wotton 1
could 1
just 1
catch 1
the 1
gleam 1
of 1
the 1
honey 1
sweet 1
and 1
honey 1
coloured 1
blossoms 1
of 1
a 1
laburnum 1
whose 1
tremulous 1
branches 1
seemed 1
hardly 1
able 1
to 1
bear 1
the 1
burden 1
of 1
a 1
beauty 1
so 1
flamelike 1
as 1
theirs 1
and 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
fantastic 1
shadows 1
of 1
birds 1
in 1
flight 1
flitted 1
across 1
the 1
long 1
tussore 1
silk 1
curtains 1
that 1
were 1
stretched 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
huge 1
window 1
producing 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
momentary 1
Japanese 1
effect 1
and 1
making 1
him 1
think 1
of 1
those 1
pallid 1
jade 1
faced 1
painters 1
of 1
Tokyo 1
who 1
through 1
the 1
medium 1
of 1
an 1
art 1
that 1
is 1
necessarily 1
immobile 1
seek 1
to 1
convey 1
the 1
sense 1
of 1
swiftness 1
and 1
motion 1
The 1
sullen 1
murmur 1
of 1
the 1
bees 1
shouldering 1
their 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
long 1
unmown 1
grass 1
or 1
circling 1
with 1
monotonous 1
insistence 1
round 1
the 1
dusty 1
gilt 1
horns 1
of 1
the 1
straggling 1
woodbine 1
seemed 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
stillness 1
more 1
oppressive 1
The 1
dim 1
roar 1
of 1
London 1
was 1
like 1
the 1
bourdon 1
note 1
of 1
a 1
distant 1
organ 1
In 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
clamped 1
to 1
an 1
upright 1
easel 1
stood 1
the 1
full 1
length 1
portrait 1
of 1
a 1
young 1
man 1
of 1
extraordinary 1
personal 1
beauty 1
and 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
it 1
some 1
little 1
distance 1
away 1
was 1
sitting 1
the 1
artist 1
himself 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
whose 1
sudden 1
disappearance 1
some 1
years 1
ago 1
caused 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
such 1
public 1
excitement 1
and 1
gave 1
rise 1
to 1
so 1
many 1
strange 1
conjectures 1
As 1
the 1
painter 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
gracious 1
and 1
comely 1
form 1
he 1
had 1
so 1
skilfully 1
mirrored 1
in 1
his 1
art 1
a 1
smile 1
of 1
pleasure 1
passed 1
across 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
seemed 1
about 1
to 1
linger 1
there 1
But 1
he 1
suddenly 1
started 1
up 1
and 1
closing 1
his 1
eyes 1
placed 1
his 1
fingers 1
upon 1
the 1
lids 1
as 1
though 1
he 1
sought 1
to 1
imprison 1
within 1
his 1
brain 1
some 1
curious 1
dream 1
from 1
which 1
he 1
feared 1
he 1
might 1
awake 1
It 1
is 1
your 1
best 1
work 1
Basil 1
the 1
best 1
thing 1
you 1
have 1
ever 1
done 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
languidly 1
You 1
must 1
certainly 1
send 1
it 1
next 1
year 1
to 1
the 1
Grosvenor 1
The 1
Academy 1
is 1
too 1
large 1
and 1
too 1
vulgar 1
Whenever 1
I 1
have 1
gone 1
there 2
have 1
been 1
either 1
so 1
many 1
people 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
pictures 1
which 1
was 1
dreadful 1
or 1
so 1
many 1
pictures 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
people 1
which 1
was 1
worse 1
The 1
Grosvenor 1
is 1
really 1
the 1
only 1
place 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
I 1
shall 1
send 1
it 1
anywhere 1
he 1
answered 1
tossing 1
his 1
head 1
back 1
in 1
that 1
odd 1
way 1
that 1
used 1
to 1
make 1
his 1
friends 1
laugh 1
at 1
him 1
at 1
Oxford 1
No 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
send 1
it 1
anywhere 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
elevated 1
his 1
eyebrows 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
in 1
amazement 1
through 1
the 1
thin 1
blue 1
wreaths 1
of 1
smoke 1
that 1
curled 1
up 1
in 1
such 1
fanciful 1
whorls 1
from 1
his 1
heavy 1
opium 1
tainted 1
cigarette 1
Not 1
send 1
it 1
anywhere 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
why 1
Have 1
you 1
any 1
reason 1
What 1
odd 1
chaps 1
you 1
painters 1
are 1
You 1
do 1
anything 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
gain 1
a 1
reputation 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
one 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
want 1
to 1
throw 1
it 1
away 1
It 1
is 1
silly 1
of 1
you 1
for 1
there 1
is 1
only 1
one 1
thing 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
worse 1
than 1
being 1
talked 1
about 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
being 1
talked 1
about 1
A 1
portrait 1
like 1
this 1
would 1
set 1
you 1
far 1
above 1
all 1
the 1
young 1
men 1
in 1
England 1
and 1
make 1
the 1
old 1
men 1
quite 1
jealous 1
if 1
old 1
men 1
are 1
ever 1
capable 1
of 1
any 1
emotion 1
I 1
know 1
you 1
will 1
laugh 1
at 1
me 1
he 1
replied 1
but 1
I 1
really 1
can 1
t 1
exhibit 1
it 1
I 1
have 1
put 1
too 1
much 1
of 1
myself 1
into 1
it 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
stretched 1
himself 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
divan 1
and 1
laughed 1
Yes 1
I 1
knew 1
you 1
would 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
true 1
all 1
the 1
same 1
Too 1
much 1
of 1
yourself 1
in 1
it 1
Upon 1
my 1
word 1
Basil 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
you 1
were 1
so 1
vain 1
and 1
I 1
really 1
can 1
t 1
see 1
any 1
resemblance 1
between 1
you 1
with 1
your 1
rugged 1
strong 1
face 1
and 1
your 1
coal 1
black 1
hair 1
and 1
this 1
young 1
Adonis 1
who 1
looks 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
made 1
out 1
of 1
ivory 1
and 1
rose 1
leaves 1
Why 1
my 1
dear 1
Basil 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
Narcissus 1
and 1
you 1
well 1
of 1
course 1
you 1
have 1
an 1
intellectual 1
expression 1
and 1
all 1
that 1
But 1
beauty 1
real 1
beauty 1
ends 1
where 1
an 1
intellectual 1
expression 1
begins 1
Intellect 1
is 1
in 1
itself 1
a 1
mode 1
of 1
exaggeration 1
and 1
destroys 1
the 1
harmony 1
of 1
any 1
face 1
The 1
moment 1
one 1
sits 1
down 1
to 1
think 1
one 1
becomes 1
all 1
nose 1
or 1
all 1
forehead 1
or 1
something 1
horrid 1
Look 1
at 1
the 1
successful 1
men 1
in 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
learned 1
professions 1
How 1
perfectly 1
hideous 1
they 1
are 1
Except 1
of 1
course 1
in 1
the 1
Church 1
But 1
then 1
in 1
the 1
Church 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
A 1
bishop 1
keeps 1
on 1
saying 1
at 1
the 1
age 1
of 1
eighty 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
told 1
to 1
say 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
boy 1
of 1
eighteen 1
and 1
as 1
a 1
natural 1
consequence 1
he 1
always 1
looks 1
absolutely 1
delightful 1
Your 1
mysterious 1
young 1
friend 1
whose 1
name 1
you 1
have 1
never 1
told 1
me 1
but 1
whose 1
picture 1
really 1
fascinates 1
me 1
never 1
thinks 1
I 1
feel 1
quite 1
sure 1
of 1
that 1
He 1
is 1
some 1
brainless 1
beautiful 1
creature 1
who 1
should 1
be 1
always 1
here 1
in 1
winter 1
when 1
we 1
have 1
no 1
flowers 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
and 1
always 1
here 1
in 1
summer 1
when 1
we 1
want 1
something 1
to 1
chill 1
our 1
intelligence 1
Don 1
t 1
flatter 1
yourself 1
Basil 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
like 1
him 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
understand 1
me 1
Harry 1
answered 1
the 1
artist 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
like 1
him 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
perfectly 1
well 1
Indeed 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
sorry 1
to 1
look 1
like 1
him 1
You 1
shrug 1
your 1
shoulders 1
I 1
am 1
telling 1
you 1
the 1
truth 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
fatality 1
about 1
all 1
physical 1
and 1
intellectual 1
distinction 1
the 1
sort 1
of 1
fatality 1
that 1
seems 1
to 1
dog 1
through 1
history 1
the 1
faltering 1
steps 1
of 1
kings 1
It 1
is 1
better 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
different 1
from 1
one 1
s 1
fellows 1
The 1
ugly 1
and 1
the 1
stupid 1
have 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
it 1
in 1
this 1
world 1
They 1
can 1
sit 1
at 1
their 1
ease 1
and 1
gape 1
at 1
the 1
play 1
If 1
they 1
know 1
nothing 1
of 1
victory 1
they 1
are 1
at 1
least 1
spared 1
the 1
knowledge 1
of 1
defeat 1
They 1
live 1
as 1
we 1
all 1
should 1
live 1
undisturbed 1
indifferent 1
and 1
without 1
disquiet 1
They 1
neither 1
bring 1
ruin 1
upon 1
others 1
nor 1
ever 1
receive 1
it 1
from 1
alien 1
hands 1
Your 1
rank 1
and 1
wealth 1
Harry 1
my 1
brains 1
such 1
as 1
they 1
are 1
my 1
art 1
whatever 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
worth 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
s 1
good 1
looks 1
we 1
shall 1
all 1
suffer 1
for 1
what 1
the 1
gods 1
have 1
given 1
us 1
suffer 1
terribly 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
Is 1
that 1
his 1
name 1
asked 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
walking 1
across 1
the 1
studio 1
towards 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
Yes 1
that 1
is 1
his 1
name 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
intend 1
to 1
tell 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
But 1
why 1
not 1
Oh 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
explain 1
When 1
I 1
like 1
people 1
immensely 1
I 1
never 1
tell 1
their 1
names 1
to 1
any 1
one 1
It 1
is 1
like 1
surrendering 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
them 1
I 1
have 1
grown 1
to 1
love 1
secrecy 1
It 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
one 1
thing 1
that 1
can 1
make 1
modern 1
life 1
mysterious 1
or 1
marvellous 1
to 1
us 1
The 1
commonest 1
thing 1
is 1
delightful 1
if 1
one 1
only 1
hides 1
it 1
When 1
I 1
leave 1
town 1
now 1
I 1
never 1
tell 1
my 1
people 1
where 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
If 1
I 1
did 1
I 1
would 1
lose 1
all 1
my 1
pleasure 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
silly 1
habit 1
I 1
dare 1
say 1
but 1
somehow 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
bring 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
romance 1
into 1
one 1
s 1
life 1
I 1
suppose 1
you 1
think 1
me 1
awfully 1
foolish 1
about 1
it 1
Not 1
at 1
all 1
answered 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
my 1
dear 1
Basil 1
You 1
seem 1
to 1
forget 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
married 1
and 1
the 1
one 1
charm 1
of 1
marriage 1
is 1
that 1
it 1
makes 1
a 1
life 1
of 1
deception 1
absolutely 1
necessary 1
for 1
both 1
parties 1
I 1
never 1
know 1
where 1
my 1
wife 1
is 1
and 1
my 1
wife 1
never 1
knows 1
what 1
I 1
am 1
doing 1
When 1
we 1
meet 1
we 1
do 1
meet 1
occasionally 1
when 1
we 1
dine 1
out 1
together 1
or 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
Duke 1
s 1
we 1
tell 1
each 1
other 1
the 1
most 1
absurd 1
stories 1
with 1
the 1
most 1
serious 1
faces 1
My 1
wife 1
is 1
very 1
good 1
at 1
it 1
much 1
better 1
in 1
fact 1
than 1
I 1
am 1
She 1
never 1
gets 1
confused 1
over 1
her 1
dates 1
and 1
I 1
always 1
do 1
But 1
when 1
she 1
does 1
find 1
me 1
out 1
she 1
makes 1
no 1
row 1
at 1
all 1
I 1
sometimes 1
wish 1
she 1
would 1
but 1
she 1
merely 1
laughs 1
at 1
me 1
I 1
hate 1
the 1
way 1
you 1
talk 1
about 1
your 1
married 1
life 1
Harry 1
said 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
strolling 1
towards 1
the 1
door 1
that 1
led 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
I 1
believe 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
really 1
a 1
very 1
good 1
husband 1
but 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
thoroughly 1
ashamed 1
of 1
your 1
own 1
virtues 1
You 1
are 1
an 1
extraordinary 1
fellow 1
You 1
never 1
say 1
a 1
moral 1
thing 1
and 1
you 1
never 1
do 1
a 1
wrong 1
thing 1
Your 1
cynicism 1
is 1
simply 1
a 1
pose 1
Being 1
natural 1
is 1
simply 1
a 1
pose 1
and 1
the 1
most 1
irritating 1
pose 1
I 1
know 1
cried 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
laughing 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
young 1
men 1
went 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
together 1
and 1
ensconced 1
themselves 1
on 1
a 1
long 1
bamboo 1
seat 1
that 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
shade 1
of 1
a 1
tall 1
laurel 1
bush 1
The 1
sunlight 1
slipped 1
over 1
the 1
polished 1
leaves 1
In 1
the 1
grass 1
white 1
daisies 1
were 1
tremulous 1
After 1
a 1
pause 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
pulled 1
out 1
his 1
watch 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
I 1
must 1
be 1
going 1
Basil 1
he 1
murmured 1
and 1
before 1
I 1
go 1
I 1
insist 1
on 1
your 1
answering 1
a 1
question 1
I 1
put 1
to 1
you 1
some 1
time 1
ago 1
What 1
is 1
that 1
said 1
the 1
painter 1
keeping 1
his 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
You 1
know 1
quite 1
well 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
Harry 1
Well 1
I 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
I 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
explain 1
to 1
me 1
why 1
you 1
won 1
t 1
exhibit 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
s 1
picture 1
I 1
want 1
the 1
real 1
reason 1
I 1
told 1
you 1
the 1
real 1
reason 1
No 1
you 1
did 1
not 1
You 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
because 1
there 1
was 1
too 1
much 1
of 1
yourself 1
in 1
it 1
Now 1
that 1
is 1
childish 1
Harry 1
said 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
looking 1
him 1
straight 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
every 1
portrait 1
that 1
is 1
painted 1
with 1
feeling 1
is 1
a 1
portrait 1
of 1
the 1
artist 1
not 1
of 1
the 1
sitter 1
The 1
sitter 1
is 1
merely 1
the 1
accident 1
the 1
occasion 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
he 1
who 1
is 1
revealed 1
by 1
the 1
painter 1
it 1
is 1
rather 1
the 1
painter 1
who 1
on 1
the 1
coloured 1
canvas 1
reveals 1
himself 1
The 1
reason 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
exhibit 1
this 1
picture 1
is 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
shown 1
in 1
it 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
soul 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
laughed 1
And 1
what 1
is 1
that 1
he 1
asked 1
I 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
said 1
Hallward 1
but 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
perplexity 1
came 1
over 1
his 1
face 1
I 1
am 1
all 1
expectation 1
Basil 1
continued 1
his 1
companion 1
glancing 1
at 1
him 1
Oh 1
there 1
is 1
really 1
very 1
little 1
to 1
tell 1
Harry 1
answered 1
the 1
painter 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
you 1
will 1
hardly 1
understand 1
it 1
Perhaps 1
you 1
will 1
hardly 1
believe 1
it 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
smiled 1
and 1
leaning 1
down 1
plucked 1
a 1
pink 1
petalled 1
daisy 1
from 1
the 1
grass 1
and 1
examined 1
it 1
I 1
am 1
quite 1
sure 1
I 1
shall 1
understand 1
it 1
he 1
replied 1
gazing 1
intently 1
at 1
the 1
little 1
golden 1
white 1
feathered 1
disk 1
and 1
as 1
for 1
believing 1
things 1
I 1
can 1
believe 1
anything 1
provided 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
incredible 1
The 1
wind 1
shook 1
some 1
blossoms 1
from 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
the 1
heavy 1
lilac 1
blooms 1
with 1
their 1
clustering 1
stars 1
moved 1
to 1
and 1
fro 1
in 1
the 1
languid 1
air 1
A 1
grasshopper 1
began 1
to 1
chirrup 1
by 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
like 1
a 1
blue 1
thread 1
a 1
long 1
thin 1
dragon 1
fly 1
floated 1
past 1
on 1
its 1
brown 1
gauze 1
wings 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
hear 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
s 1
heart 1
beating 1
and 1
wondered 1
what 1
was 1
coming 1
The 1
story 1
is 1
simply 1
this 1
said 1
the 1
painter 1
after 1
some 1
time 1
Two 1
months 1
ago 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
a 1
crush 1
at 1
Lady 1
Brandon 1
s 1
You 1
know 1
we 1
poor 1
artists 1
have 1
to 1
show 1
ourselves 1
in 1
society 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
just 1
to 1
remind 1
the 1
public 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
savages 1
With 1
an 1
evening 1
coat 1
and 1
a 1
white 1
tie 1
as 1
you 1
told 1
me 1
once 1
anybody 1
even 1
a 1
stock 1
broker 1
can 1
gain 1
a 1
reputation 1
for 1
being 1
civilized 1
Well 1
after 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
about 1
ten 1
minutes 1
talking 1
to 1
huge 1
overdressed 1
dowagers 1
and 1
tedious 1
academicians 1
I 1
suddenly 1
became 1
conscious 1
that 1
some 1
one 1
was 1
looking 1
at 1
me 1
I 1
turned 1
half 1
way 1
round 1
and 1
saw 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
When 1
our 1
eyes 1
met 1
I 1
felt 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
growing 1
pale 1
A 1
curious 1
sensation 1
of 1
terror 1
came 1
over 1
me 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
come 1
face 1
to 1
face 1
with 1
some 1
one 1
whose 1
mere 1
personality 1
was 1
so 1
fascinating 1
that 1
if 1
I 1
allowed 1
it 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
it 1
would 1
absorb 1
my 1
whole 1
nature 1
my 1
whole 1
soul 1
my 1
very 1
art 1
itself 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
any 1
external 1
influence 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
You 1
know 1
yourself 1
Harry 1
how 1
independent 1
I 1
am 1
by 1
nature 1
I 1
have 1
always 1
been 1
my 1
own 1
master 1
had 1
at 1
least 1
always 1
been 1
so 1
till 1
I 1
met 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
Then 1
but 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
explain 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
Something 1
seemed 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
verge 1
of 1
a 1
terrible 1
crisis 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
strange 1
feeling 1
that 1
fate 1
had 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
me 1
exquisite 1
joys 1
and 1
exquisite 1
sorrows 1
I 1
grew 1
afraid 1
and 1
turned 1
to 1
quit 1
the 1
room 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
conscience 1
that 1
made 1
me 1
do 1
so 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
cowardice 1
I 1
take 1
no 1
credit 1
to 1
myself 1
for 1
trying 1
to 1
escape 1
Conscience 1
and 1
cowardice 1
are 1
really 1
the 1
same 1
things 1
Basil 1
Conscience 1
is 1
the 1
trade 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
firm 1
That 1
is 1
all 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
believe 1
that 1
Harry 1
and 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
believe 1
you 1
do 1
either 1
However 1
whatever 1
was 1
my 1
motive 1
and 1
it 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
pride 1
for 1
I 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
very 1
proud 1
I 1
certainly 1
struggled 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
There 1
of 1
course 1
I 1
stumbled 1
against 1
Lady 1
Brandon 1
You 1
are 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
so 1
soon 1
Mr 1
Hallward 1
she 1
screamed 1
out 1
You 1
know 1
her 1
curiously 1
shrill 1
voice 1
Yes 1
she 1
is 1
a 1
peacock 1
in 1
everything 1
but 1
beauty 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
pulling 1
the 1
daisy 1
to 1
bits 1
with 1
his 1
long 1
nervous 1
fingers 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
her 1
She 1
brought 1
me 1
up 1
to 1
royalties 1
and 1
people 1
with 1
stars 1
and 1
garters 1
and 1
elderly 1
ladies 1
with 1
gigantic 1
tiaras 1
and 1
parrot 1
noses 1
She 1
spoke 1
of 1
me 1
as 1
her 1
dearest 1
friend 1
I 1
had 1
only 1
met 1
her 1
once 1
before 1
but 1
she 1
took 1
it 1
into 1
her 1
head 1
to 1
lionize 1
me 1
I 1
believe 1
some 1
picture 1
of 1
mine 1
had 1
made 1
a 1
great 1
success 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
at 1
least 1
had 1
been 1
chattered 1
about 1
in 1
the 1
penny 1
newspapers 1
which 1
is 1
the 1
nineteenth 1
century 1
standard 1
of 1
immortality 1
Suddenly 1
I 1
found 1
myself 1
face 1
to 1
face 1
with 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
whose 1
personality 1
had 1
so 1
strangely 1
stirred 1
me 1
We 1
were 1
quite 1
close 1
almost 1
touching 1
Our 1
eyes 1
met 1
again 1
It 1
was 1
reckless 1
of 1
me 1
but 1
I 1
asked 1
Lady 1
Brandon 1
to 1
introduce 1
me 1
to 1
him 1
Perhaps 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
so 1
reckless 1
after 1
all 1
It 1
was 1
simply 1
inevitable 1
We 1
would 1
have 1
spoken 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
without 1
any 1
introduction 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
of 1
that 1
Dorian 1
told 1
me 1
so 1
afterwards 1
He 1
too 1
felt 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
destined 1
to 1
know 1
each 1
other 1
And 1
how 1
did 1
Lady 1
Brandon 1
describe 1
this 1
wonderful 1
young 1
man 1
asked 1
his 1
companion 1
I 1
know 1
she 1
goes 1
in 1
for 1
giving 1
a 1
rapid 1
precis 1
of 1
all 1
her 1
guests 1
I 1
remember 1
her 1
bringing 1
me 1
up 1
to 1
a 1
truculent 1
and 1
red 1
faced 1
old 1
gentleman 1
covered 1
all 1
over 1
with 1
orders 1
and 1
ribbons 1
and 1
hissing 1
into 1
my 1
ear 1
in 1
a 1
tragic 1
whisper 1
which 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
perfectly 1
audible 1
to 1
everybody 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
the 1
most 1
astounding 1
details 1
I 1
simply 1
fled 1
I 1
like 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
people 1
for 1
myself 1
But 1
Lady 1
Brandon 1
treats 1
her 1
guests 1
exactly 1
as 1
an 1
auctioneer 1
treats 1
his 1
goods 1
She 1
either 1
explains 1
them 1
entirely 1
away 1
or 1
tells 1
one 1
everything 1
about 1
them 1
except 1
what 1
one 1
wants 1
to 1
know 1
Poor 1
Lady 1
Brandon 1
You 1
are 1
hard 1
on 1
her 1
Harry 1
said 1
Hallward 1
listlessly 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
found 1
a 1
salon 1
and 1
only 1
succeeded 1
in 1
opening 1
a 1
restaurant 1
How 1
could 1
I 1
admire 1
her 1
But 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
did 1
she 1
say 1
about 1
Mr 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
Oh 1
something 1
like 1
Charming 1
boy 1
poor 1
dear 1
mother 1
and 1
I 1
absolutely 1
inseparable 1
Quite 1
forget 1
what 1
he 1
does 1
afraid 1
he 1
doesn 1
t 1
do 1
anything 1
oh 1
yes 1
plays 1
the 1
piano 1
or 1
is 1
it 1
the 1
violin 1
dear 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
Neither 1
of 1
us 1
could 1
help 1
laughing 1
and 1
we 1
became 1
friends 1
at 1
once 1
Laughter 1
is 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
a 1
bad 1
beginning 1
for 1
a 1
friendship 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
far 1
the 1
best 1
ending 1
for 1
one 1
said 1
the 1
young 1
lord 1
plucking 1
another 1
daisy 1
Hallward 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
understand 1
what 1
friendship 1
is 1
Harry 1
he 1
murmured 1
or 1
what 1
enmity 1
is 1
for 1
that 1
matter 1
You 1
like 1
every 1
one 1
that 1
is 1
to 1
say 1
you 1
are 1
indifferent 1
to 1
every 1
one 1
How 1
horribly 1
unjust 1
of 1
you 1
cried 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
tilting 1
his 1
hat 1
back 1
and 1
looking 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
little 1
clouds 1
that 1
like 1
ravelled 1
skeins 1
of 1
glossy 1
white 1
silk 1
were 1
drifting 1
across 1
the 1
hollowed 1
turquoise 1
of 1
the 1
summer 1
sky 1
Yes 1
horribly 1
unjust 1
of 1
you 1
I 1
make 1
a 1
great 1
difference 1
between 1
people 1
I 1
choose 1
my 1
friends 1
for 1
their 1
good 1
looks 1
my 1
acquaintances 1
for 1
their 1
good 1
characters 1
and 1
my 1
enemies 1
for 1
their 1
good 1
intellects 1
A 1
man 1
cannot 1
be 1
too 1
careful 1
in 1
the 1
choice 1
of 1
his 1
enemies 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
got 1
one 1
who 1
is 1
a 1
fool 1
They 1
are 1
all 1
men 1
of 1
some 1
intellectual 1
power 1
and 1
consequently 1
they 1
all 1
appreciate 1
me 1
Is 1
that 1
very 1
vain 1
of 1
me 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
rather 1
vain 1
I 1
should 1
think 1
it 1
was 1
Harry 1
But 1
according 1
to 1
your 1
category 1
I 1
must 1
be 1
merely 1
an 1
acquaintance 1
My 1
dear 1
old 1
Basil 1
you 1
are 1
much 1
more 1
than 1
an 1
acquaintance 1
And 1
much 1
less 1
than 1
a 1
friend 1
A 1
sort 1
of 1
brother 1
I 1
suppose 1
Oh 1
brothers 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
for 1
brothers 1
My 1
elder 1
brother 1
won 1
t 1
die 1
and 1
my 1
younger 1
brothers 1
seem 1
never 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
else 1
Harry 1
exclaimed 1
Hallward 1
frowning 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
quite 1
serious 1
But 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
help 1
detesting 1
my 1
relations 1
I 1
suppose 1
it 1
comes 1
from 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
none 1
of 1
us 1
can 1
stand 1
other 1
people 1
having 1
the 1
same 1
faults 1
as 1
ourselves 1
I 1
quite 1
sympathize 1
with 1
the 1
rage 1
of 1
the 1
English 1
democracy 1
against 1
what 1
they 1
call 1
the 1
vices 1
of 1
the 1
upper 1
orders 1
The 1
masses 1
feel 1
that 1
drunkenness 1
stupidity 1
and 1
immorality 1
should 1
be 1
their 1
own 1
special 1
property 1
and 1
that 1
if 1
any 1
one 1
of 1
us 1
makes 1
an 1
ass 1
of 1
himself 1
he 1
is 1
poaching 1
on 1
their 1
preserves 1
When 1
poor 1
Southwark 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
divorce 1
court 1
their 1
indignation 1
was 1
quite 1
magnificent 1
And 1
yet 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
suppose 1
that 1
ten 1
per 1
cent 1
of 1
the 1
proletariat 1
live 1
correctly 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
agree 1
with 1
a 1
single 1
word 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
said 1
and 1
what 1
is 1
more 1
Harry 1
I 1
feel 1
sure 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
either 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
stroked 1
his 1
pointed 1
brown 1
beard 1
and 1
tapped 1
the 1
toe 1
of 1
his 1
patent 1
leather 1
boot 1
with 1
a 1
tasselled 1
ebony 1
cane 1
How 1
English 1
you 1
are 1
Basil 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
second 1
time 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
that 1
observation 1
If 1
one 1
puts 1
forward 1
an 1
idea 1
to 1
a 1
true 1
Englishman 1
always 1
a 1
rash 1
thing 1
to 1
do 1
he 1
never 1
dreams 1
of 1
considering 1
whether 1
the 1
idea 1
is 1
right 1
or 1
wrong 1
The 1
only 1
thing 1
he 1
considers 1
of 1
any 1
importance 1
is 1
whether 1
one 1
believes 1
it 1
oneself 1
Now 1
the 1
value 1
of 1
an 1
idea 1
has 1
nothing 1
whatsoever 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
the 1
sincerity 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
expresses 1
it 1
Indeed 1
the 1
probabilities 1
are 1
that 1
the 1
more 1
insincere 1
the 1
man 1
is 1
the 1
more 1
purely 1
intellectual 1
will 1
the 1
idea 1
be 1
as 1
in 1
that 1
case 1
it 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
coloured 1
by 1
either 1
his 1
wants 1
his 1
desires 1
or 1
his 1
prejudices 1
However 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
propose 1
to 1
discuss 1
politics 1
sociology 1
or 1
metaphysics 1
with 1
you 1
I 1
like 1
persons 1
better 1
than 1
principles 1
and 1
I 1
like 1
persons 1
with 1
no 1
principles 1
better 1
than 1
anything 1
else 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
Tell 1
me 1
more 1
about 1
Mr 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
How 1
often 1
do 1
you 1
see 1
him 1
Every 1
day 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
be 1
happy 1
if 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
see 1
him 1
every 1
day 1
He 1
is 1
absolutely 1
necessary 1
to 1
me 1
How 1
extraordinary 1
I 1
thought 1
you 1
would 1
never 1
care 1
for 1
anything 1
but 1
your 1
art 1
He 1
is 1
all 1
my 1
art 1
to 1
me 1
now 1
said 1
the 1
painter 1
gravely 1
I 1
sometimes 1
think 1
Harry 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
only 1
two 1
eras 1
of 1
any 1
importance 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
s 1
history 1
The 1
first 1
is 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
a 1
new 1
medium 1
for 1
art 1
and 1
the 1
second 1
is 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
a 1
new 1
personality 1
for 1
art 1
also 1
What 1
the 1
invention 1
of 1
oil 1
painting 1
was 1
to 1
the 1
Venetians 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
Antinous 1
was 1
to 1
late 1
Greek 1
sculpture 1
and 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
will 1
some 1
day 1
be 1
to 1
me 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
merely 1
that 1
I 1
paint 1
from 1
him 1
draw 1
from 1
him 1
sketch 1
from 1
him 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
have 1
done 1
all 1
that 1
But 1
he 1
is 1
much 1
more 1
to 1
me 1
than 1
a 1
model 1
or 1
a 1
sitter 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
dissatisfied 1
with 1
what 1
I 1
have 1
done 1
of 1
him 1
or 1
that 1
his 1
beauty 1
is 1
such 1
that 1
art 1
cannot 1
express 1
it 1
There 1
is 1
nothing 1
that 1
art 1
cannot 1
express 1
and 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
work 1
I 1
have 1
done 1
since 1
I 1
met 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
is 1
good 1
work 1
is 1
the 1
best 1
work 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
But 1
in 1
some 1
curious 1
way 1
I 1
wonder 1
will 1
you 1
understand 1
me 1
his 1
personality 1
has 1
suggested 1
to 1
me 1
an 1
entirely 1
new 1
manner 1
in 1
art 1
an 1
entirely 1
new 1
mode 1
of 1
style 1
I 1
see 1
things 1
differently 1
I 1
think 1
of 1
them 1
differently 1
I 1
can 1
now 1
recreate 1
life 1
in 1
a 1
way 1
that 1
was 1
hidden 1
from 1
me 1
before 1
A 1
dream 1
of 1
form 1
in 1
days 1
of 1
thought 1
who 1
is 1
it 1
who 1
says 1
that 1
I 1
forget 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
what 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
has 1
been 1
to 1
me 1
The 1
merely 1
visible 1
presence 1
of 1
this 1
lad 1
for 1
he 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
little 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
lad 1
though 1
he 1
is 1
really 1
over 1
twenty 1
his 1
merely 1
visible 1
presence 1
ah 1
I 1
wonder 1
can 1
you 1
realize 1
all 1
that 2
means 1
Unconsciously 1
he 1
defines 1
for 1
me 1
the 1
lines 1
of 1
a 1
fresh 1
school 1
a 1
school 1
that 1
is 1
to 1
have 1
in 1
it 1
all 1
the 1
passion 1
of 1
the 1
romantic 1
spirit 1
all 1
the 1
perfection 1
of 1
the 1
spirit 1
that 1
is 1
Greek 1
The 1
harmony 1
of 1
soul 1
and 1
body 1
how 1
much 1
that 1
is 1
We 1
in 1
our 1
madness 1
have 1
separated 1
the 1
two 1
and 1
have 1
invented 1
a 1
realism 1
that 1
is 1
vulgar 1
an 1
ideality 1
that 1
is 1
void 1
Harry 1
if 1
you 1
only 1
knew 1
what 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
is 1
to 1
me 1
You 1
remember 1
that 1
landscape 1
of 1
mine 1
for 1
which 1
Agnew 1
offered 1
me 1
such 1
a 1
huge 1
price 1
but 1
which 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
part 1
with 1
It 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
best 1
things 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
done 1
And 1
why 1
is 1
it 1
so 1
Because 1
while 1
I 1
was 1
painting 1
it 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
sat 1
beside 1
me 1
Some 1
subtle 1
influence 1
passed 1
from 1
him 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
I 1
saw 1
in 1
the 1
plain 1
woodland 1
the 1
wonder 1
I 1
had 1
always 1
looked 1
for 1
and 1
always 1
missed 1
Basil 1
this 1
is 1
extraordinary 1
I 1
must 1
see 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
Hallward 1
got 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
seat 1
and 1
walked 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
garden 1
After 1
some 1
time 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
Harry 1
he 1
said 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
is 1
to 1
me 1
simply 1
a 1
motive 1
in 1
art 1
You 1
might 1
see 1
nothing 1
in 1
him 1
I 1
see 1
everything 1
in 1
him 1
He 1
is 1
never 1
more 1
present 1
in 1
my 1
work 1
than 1
when 1
no 1
image 1
of 1
him 1
is 1
there 1
He 1
is 1
a 1
suggestion 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
said 1
of 1
a 1
new 1
manner 1
I 1
find 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
curves 1
of 1
certain 1
lines 1
in 1
the 1
loveliness 1
and 1
subtleties 1
of 1
certain 1
colours 1
That 1
is 1
all 1
Then 1
why 1
won 1
t 1
you 1
exhibit 1
his 1
portrait 1
asked 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Because 1
without 1
intending 1
it 1
I 1
have 1
put 1
into 1
it 1
some 1
expression 1
of 1
all 1
this 1
curious 1
artistic 1
idolatry 1
of 1
which 1
of 1
course 1
I 1
have 1
never 1
cared 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
him 1
He 1
knows 1
nothing 1
about 1
it 1
He 1
shall 1
never 1
know 1
anything 1
about 1
it 1
But 1
the 1
world 1
might 1
guess 1
it 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
bare 1
my 1
soul 1
to 1
their 1
shallow 1
prying 1
eyes 1
My 1
heart 1
shall 1
never 1
be 1
put 1
under 1
their 1
microscope 1
There 1
is 1
too 1
much 1
of 1
myself 1
in 1
the 1
thing 1
Harry 1
too 1
much 1
of 1
myself 1
Poets 1
are 1
not 1
so 1
scrupulous 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
They 1
know 1
how 1
useful 1
passion 1
is 1
for 1
publication 1
Nowadays 1
a 1
broken 1
heart 1
will 1
run 1
to 1
many 1
editions 1
I 1
hate 1
them 1
for 1
it 1
cried 1
Hallward 1
An 1
artist 1
should 1
create 1
beautiful 1
things 1
but 1
should 1
put 1
nothing 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
life 1
into 1
them 1
We 1
live 1
in 1
an 1
age 1
when 1
men 1
treat 1
art 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
meant 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
form 1
of 1
autobiography 1
We 1
have 1
lost 1
the 1
abstract 1
sense 1
of 1
beauty 1
Some 1
day 1
I 1
will 1
show 1
the 1
world 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
and 1
for 1
that 1
reason 1
the 1
world 1
shall 1
never 1
see 1
my 1
portrait 1
of 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
I 1
think 1
you 1
are 1
wrong 1
Basil 1
but 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
argue 1
with 1
you 1
It 1
is 1
only 1
the 1
intellectually 1
lost 1
who 1
ever 1
argue 1
Tell 1
me 1
is 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
you 1
The 1
painter 1
considered 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
He 1
likes 1
me 1
he 1
answered 1
after 1
a 1
pause 1
I 1
know 1
he 1
likes 1
me 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
flatter 1
him 1
dreadfully 1
I 1
find 1
a 1
strange 1
pleasure 1
in 1
saying 1
things 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
I 1
know 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
sorry 1
for 1
having 1
said 1
As 1
a 1
rule 1
he 1
is 1
charming 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
we 1
sit 1
in 1
the 1
studio 1
and 1
talk 1
of 1
a 1
thousand 1
things 1
Now 1
and 1
then 1
however 1
he 1
is 1
horribly 1
thoughtless 1
and 1
seems 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
real 1
delight 1
in 1
giving 1
me 1
pain 1
Then 1
I 1
feel 1
Harry 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
given 1
away 1
my 1
whole 1
soul 1
to 1
some 1
one 1
who 1
treats 1
it 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
a 1
flower 1
to 1
put 1
in 1
his 1
coat 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
decoration 1
to 1
charm 1
his 1
vanity 1
an 1
ornament 1
for 1
a 1
summer 1
s 1
day 1
Days 1
in 1
summer 1
Basil 1
are 1
apt 1
to 1
linger 1
murmured 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Perhaps 1
you 1
will 1
tire 1
sooner 1
than 1
he 1
will 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
sad 1
thing 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
genius 1
lasts 1
longer 1
than 1
beauty 1
That 1
accounts 1
for 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
we 1
all 1
take 1
such 1
pains 1
to 1
over 1
educate 1
ourselves 1
In 1
the 1
wild 1
struggle 1
for 1
existence 1
we 1
want 1
to 1
have 1
something 1
that 1
endures 1
and 1
so 1
we 1
fill 1
our 1
minds 1
with 1
rubbish 1
and 1
facts 1
in 1
the 1
silly 1
hope 1
of 1
keeping 1
our 1
place 1
The 1
thoroughly 1
well 1
informed 1
man 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
modern 1
ideal 1
And 1
the 1
mind 1
of 1
the 1
thoroughly 1
well 1
informed 1
man 1
is 1
a 1
dreadful 1
thing 1
It 1
is 1
like 1
a 1
bric 1
a 1
brac 1
shop 1
all 1
monsters 1
and 1
dust 1
with 1
everything 1
priced 1
above 1
its 1
proper 1
value 1
I 1
think 1
you 1
will 1
tire 1
first 1
all 1
the 1
same 1
Some 1
day 1
you 1
will 1
look 1
at 1
your 1
friend 1
and 1
he 1
will 1
seem 1
to 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
little 1
out 1
of 1
drawing 1
or 1
you 1
won 1
t 1
like 1
his 1
tone 1
of 1
colour 1
or 1
something 1
You 1
will 1
bitterly 1
reproach 1
him 1
in 1
your 1
own 1
heart 1
and 1
seriously 1
think 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
behaved 1
very 1
badly 1
to 1
you 1
The 1
next 1
time 1
he 1
calls 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
perfectly 1
cold 1
and 1
indifferent 1
It 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
great 1
pity 1
for 1
it 1
will 1
alter 1
you 1
What 1
you 1
have 1
told 1
me 1
is 1
quite 1
a 1
romance 1
a 1
romance 1
of 1
art 1
one 1
might 1
call 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
worst 1
of 1
having 1
a 1
romance 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
is 1
that 1
it 1
leaves 1
one 1
so 1
unromantic 1
Harry 1
don 1
t 1
talk 1
like 1
that 1
As 1
long 1
as 1
I 1
live 1
the 1
personality 1
of 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
will 1
dominate 1
me 1
You 1
can 1
t 1
feel 1
what 1
I 1
feel 1
You 1
change 1
too 1
often 1
Ah 1
my 1
dear 1
Basil 1
that 1
is 1
exactly 1
why 1
I 1
can 1
feel 1
it 1
Those 1
who 1
are 1
faithful 1
know 1
only 1
the 1
trivial 1
side 1
of 1
love 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
faithless 1
who 1
know 1
love 1
s 1
tragedies 1
And 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
struck 1
a 1
light 1
on 1
a 1
dainty 1
silver 1
case 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
smoke 1
a 1
cigarette 1
with 1
a 1
self 1
conscious 1
and 1
satisfied 1
air 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
summed 1
up 1
the 1
world 1
in 1
a 1
phrase 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
rustle 1
of 1
chirruping 1
sparrows 1
in 1
the 1
green 1
lacquer 1
leaves 1
of 1
the 1
ivy 1
and 1
the 1
blue 1
cloud 1
shadows 1
chased 1
themselves 1
across 1
the 1
grass 1
like 1
swallows 1
How 1
pleasant 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
And 1
how 1
delightful 1
other 1
people 1
s 1
emotions 1
were 1
much 1
more 1
delightful 1
than 1
their 1
ideas 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
One 1
s 1
own 1
soul 1
and 1
the 1
passions 1
of 1
one 1
s 1
friends 1
those 1
were 1
the 1
fascinating 1
things 1
in 1
life 1
He 1
pictured 1
to 1
himself 1
with 1
silent 1
amusement 1
the 1
tedious 1
luncheon 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
missed 1
by 1
staying 1
so 1
long 1
with 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
Had 1
he 1
gone 1
to 1
his 1
aunt 1
s 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
sure 1
to 1
have 1
met 1
Lord 1
Goodbody 1
there 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
conversation 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
about 1
the 1
feeding 1
of 1
the 1
poor 1
and 1
the 1
necessity 1
for 1
model 1
lodging 1
houses 1
Each 1
class 1
would 1
have 1
preached 1
the 1
importance 1
of 1
those 1
virtues 1
for 1
whose 1
exercise 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
necessity 1
in 1
their 1
own 1
lives 1
The 1
rich 1
would 1
have 1
spoken 1
on 1
the 1
value 1
of 1
thrift 1
and 1
the 1
idle 1
grown 1
eloquent 1
over 1
the 1
dignity 1
of 1
labour 1
It 1
was 1
charming 1
to 1
have 1
escaped 1
all 1
that 1
As 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
his 1
aunt 1
an 1
idea 1
seemed 1
to 1
strike 1
him 1
He 1
turned 1
to 1
Hallward 1
and 1
said 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
I 1
have 1
just 1
remembered 1
Remembered 1
what 1
Harry 1
Where 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
Where 1
was 1
it 1
asked 1
Hallward 1
with 1
a 1
slight 1
frown 1
Don 1
t 1
look 1
so 1
angry 1
Basil 1
It 1
was 1
at 1
my 1
aunt 1
Lady 1
Agatha 1
s 1
She 1
told 1
me 1
she 1
had 1
discovered 1
a 1
wonderful 1
young 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
help 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
East 1
End 1
and 1
that 1
his 1
name 1
was 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
I 1
am 1
bound 1
to 1
state 1
that 1
she 1
never 1
told 1
me 1
he 1
was 1
good 1
looking 1
Women 1
have 1
no 1
appreciation 1
of 1
good 1
looks 1
at 1
least 1
good 1
women 1
have 1
not 1
She 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
earnest 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
beautiful 1
nature 1
I 1
at 1
once 1
pictured 1
to 1
myself 1
a 1
creature 1
with 1
spectacles 1
and 1
lank 1
hair 1
horribly 1
freckled 1
and 1
tramping 1
about 1
on 1
huge 1
feet 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
had 1
known 1
it 1
was 1
your 1
friend 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
glad 1
you 1
didn 1
t 1
Harry 1
Why 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
meet 1
him 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
me 1
to 1
meet 1
him 1
No 1
Mr 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
studio 1
sir 1
said 1
the 1
butler 1
coming 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
You 1
must 1
introduce 1
me 1
now 1
cried 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
laughing 1
The 1
painter 1
turned 1
to 1
his 1
servant 1
who 1
stood 1
blinking 1
in 1
the 1
sunlight 1
Ask 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
to 1
wait 1
Parker 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
in 2
a 1
few 1
moments 1
The 1
man 1
bowed 1
and 1
went 1
up 1
the 1
walk 1
Then 1
he 1
looked 1
at 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
is 1
my 1
dearest 1
friend 1
he 1
said 1
He 1
has 1
a 1
simple 1
and 1
a 1
beautiful 1
nature 1
Your 1
aunt 1
was 1
quite 1
right 1
in 1
what 1
she 1
said 1
of 1
him 1
Don 1
t 1
spoil 1
him 1
Don 1
t 1
try 1
to 1
influence 1
him 1
Your 1
influence 1
would 1
be 1
bad 1
The 1
world 1
is 1
wide 1
and 1
has 1
many 1
marvellous 1
people 1
in 1
it 1
Don 1
t 1
take 1
away 1
from 1
me 1
the 1
one 1
person 1
who 1
gives 1
to 1
my 1
art 1
whatever 1
charm 1
it 1
possesses 1
my 1
life 1
as 1
an 1
artist 1
depends 1
on 1
him 1
Mind 1
Harry 1
I 1
trust 1
you 1
He 1
spoke 1
very 1
slowly 1
and 1
the 1
words 1
seemed 1
wrung 1
out 1
of 1
him 1
almost 1
against 1
his 1
will 1
What 1
nonsense 1
you 1
talk 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
smiling 1
and 1
taking 1
Hallward 1
by 1
the 1
arm 1
he 1
almost 1
led 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
CHAPTER 1
As 1
they 1
entered 1
they 1
saw 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
He 1
was 1
seated 1
at 1
the 1
piano 1
with 1
his 1
back 1
to 1
them 1
turning 1
over 1
the 1
pages 1
of 1
a 1
volume 1
of 1
Schumann 1
s 1
Forest 1
Scenes 1
You 1
must 1
lend 1
me 1
these 1
Basil 1
he 1
cried 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
learn 1
them 1
They 1
are 1
perfectly 1
charming 1
That 1
entirely 1
depends 1
on 1
how 1
you 1
sit 1
to 1
day 1
Dorian 1
Oh 1
I 1
am 1
tired 1
of 1
sitting 1
and 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
a 1
life 1
sized 1
portrait 1
of 1
myself 1
answered 1
the 1
lad 1
swinging 1
round 1
on 1
the 1
music 1
stool 1
in 1
a 1
wilful 1
petulant 1
manner 1
When 1
he 1
caught 1
sight 1
of 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
a 1
faint 1
blush 1
coloured 1
his 1
cheeks 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
he 1
started 1
up 1
I 1
beg 1
your 1
pardon 1
Basil 1
but 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
you 1
had 1
any 1
one 1
with 1
you 1
This 1
is 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Wotton 1
Dorian 1
an 1
old 1
Oxford 1
friend 1
of 1
mine 1
I 1
have 1
just 1
been 1
telling 1
him 1
what 1
a 1
capital 1
sitter 1
you 1
were 1
and 1
now 1
you 1
have 1
spoiled 1
everything 1
You 1
have 1
not 1
spoiled 1
my 1
pleasure 1
in 1
meeting 1
you 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
stepping 1
forward 1
and 1
extending 1
his 1
hand 1
My 1
aunt 1
has 1
often 1
spoken 1
to 1
me 1
about 1
you 1
You 1
are 1
one 1
of 1
her 1
favourites 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
one 1
of 1
her 1
victims 1
also 1
I 1
am 1
in 1
Lady 1
Agatha 1
s 1
black 1
books 1
at 1
present 1
answered 1
Dorian 1
with 1
a 1
funny 1
look 1
of 1
penitence 1
I 1
promised 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
a 1
club 1
in 1
Whitechapel 1
with 1
her 1
last 1
Tuesday 1
and 1
I 1
really 1
forgot 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
We 1
were 1
to 1
have 1
played 1
a 1
duet 1
together 1
three 1
duets 1
I 1
believe 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
she 1
will 1
say 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
am 1
far 1
too 1
frightened 1
to 1
call 1
Oh 1
I 1
will 1
make 1
your 1
peace 1
with 1
my 1
aunt 1
She 1
is 1
quite 1
devoted 1
to 1
you 1
And 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
it 1
really 1
matters 1
about 1
your 1
not 1
being 1
there 1
The 1
audience 1
probably 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
duet 1
When 1
Aunt 1
Agatha 1
sits 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
piano 1
she 1
makes 1
quite 1
enough 1
noise 1
for 1
two 1
people 1
That 1
is 1
very 1
horrid 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
not 1
very 1
nice 1
to 1
me 1
answered 1
Dorian 1
laughing 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
Yes 1
he 1
was 1
certainly 1
wonderfully 1
handsome 1
with 1
his 1
finely 1
curved 1
scarlet 1
lips 1
his 1
frank 1
blue 1
eyes 1
his 1
crisp 1
gold 1
hair 1
There 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
his 1
face 1
that 1
made 1
one 1
trust 1
him 1
at 1
once 1
All 1
the 1
candour 1
of 1
youth 1
was 1
there 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
all 1
youth 1
s 1
passionate 1
purity 1
One 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
kept 1
himself 1
unspotted 1
from 1
the 1
world 1
No 1
wonder 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
worshipped 1
him 1
You 1
are 1
too 1
charming 1
to 1
go 1
in 1
for 1
philanthropy 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
far 1
too 1
charming 1
And 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
flung 1
himself 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
divan 1
and 1
opened 1
his 1
cigarette 1
case 1
The 1
painter 1
had 1
been 1
busy 1
mixing 1
his 1
colours 1
and 1
getting 1
his 1
brushes 1
ready 1
He 1
was 1
looking 1
worried 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
s 1
last 1
remark 1
he 1
glanced 1
at 1
him 1
hesitated 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
then 1
said 1
Harry 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
finish 1
this 1
picture 1
to 1
day 1
Would 1
you 1
think 1
it 1
awfully 1
rude 1
of 1
me 1
if 1
I 1
asked 1
you 1
to 1
go 1
away 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
smiled 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
Am 1
I 1
to 1
go 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
he 1
asked 1
Oh 1
please 1
don 1
t 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
I 1
see 1
that 1
Basil 1
is 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
sulky 1
moods 1
and 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
bear 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
sulks 1
Besides 1
I 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
why 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
go 1
in 1
for 1
philanthropy 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
that 1
I 1
shall 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
It 1
is 1
so 1
tedious 1
a 1
subject 1
that 1
one 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
talk 1
seriously 1
about 1
it 1
But 1
I 1
certainly 1
shall 1
not 1
run 1
away 1
now 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
asked 1
me 1
to 1
stop 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
really 1
mind 1
Basil 1
do 1
you 1
You 1
have 1
often 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
liked 1
your 1
sitters 1
to 1
have 1
some 1
one 1
to 1
chat 1
to 1
Hallward 1
bit 1
his 1
lip 1
If 1
Dorian 1
wishes 1
it 1
of 1
course 1
you 1
must 1
stay 1
Dorian 1
s 1
whims 1
are 1
laws 1
to 1
everybody 1
except 1
himself 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
took 1
up 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
gloves 1
You 1
are 1
very 1
pressing 1
Basil 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
I 1
must 1
go 1
I 1
have 1
promised 1
to 1
meet 1
a 1
man 1
at 1
the 1
Orleans 1
Good 1
bye 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
Come 1
and 1
see 1
me 1
some 1
afternoon 1
in 1
Curzon 1
Street 1
I 1
am 1
nearly 1
always 1
at 1
home 1
at 1
five 1
o 1
clock 1
Write 1
to 1
me 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
coming 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
sorry 1
to 1
miss 1
you 1
Basil 1
cried 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
if 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Wotton 1
goes 1
I 1
shall 1
go 1
too 1
You 1
never 1
open 1
your 1
lips 1
while 1
you 1
are 1
painting 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
horribly 1
dull 1
standing 1
on 1
a 1
platform 1
and 1
trying 1
to 1
look 1
pleasant 1
Ask 1
him 1
to 1
stay 1
I 1
insist 1
upon 1
it 1
Stay 1
Harry 1
to 1
oblige 1
Dorian 1
and 1
to 1
oblige 1
me 1
said 1
Hallward 1
gazing 1
intently 1
at 1
his 1
picture 1
It 1
is 1
quite 1
true 1
I 1
never 1
talk 1
when 1
I 1
am 1
working 1
and 1
never 1
listen 1
either 1
and 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
dreadfully 1
tedious 1
for 1
my 1
unfortunate 1
sitters 1
I 1
beg 1
you 1
to 1
stay 1
But 1
what 1
about 1
my 1
man 1
at 1
the 1
Orleans 1
The 1
painter 1
laughed 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
any 1
difficulty 1
about 1
that 1
Sit 1
down 1
again 1
Harry 1
And 1
now 1
Dorian 1
get 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
platform 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
move 1
about 1
too 1
much 1
or 1
pay 1
any 1
attention 1
to 1
what 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
says 1
He 1
has 1
a 1
very 1
bad 1
influence 1
over 1
all 1
his 1
friends 1
with 1
the 1
single 1
exception 1
of 1
myself 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
stepped 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
dais 1
with 1
the 1
air 1
of 1
a 1
young 1
Greek 1
martyr 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
little 1
moue 1
of 1
discontent 1
to 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
to 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
rather 1
taken 1
a 1
fancy 1
He 1
was 1
so 1
unlike 1
Basil 1
They 1
made 1
a 1
delightful 1
contrast 1
And 1
he 1
had 1
such 1
a 1
beautiful 1
voice 1
After 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
Have 1
you 1
really 1
a 1
very 1
bad 1
influence 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
As 1
bad 1
as 1
Basil 1
says 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
such 1
thing 1
as 1
a 1
good 1
influence 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
All 1
influence 1
is 1
immoral 2
from 1
the 1
scientific 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
Why 1
Because 1
to 1
influence 1
a 1
person 1
is 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
one 1
s 1
own 1
soul 1
He 1
does 1
not 1
think 1
his 1
natural 1
thoughts 1
or 1
burn 1
with 1
his 1
natural 1
passions 1
His 1
virtues 1
are 1
not 1
real 1
to 1
him 1
His 1
sins 1
if 1
there 1
are 1
such 1
things 1
as 1
sins 1
are 1
borrowed 1
He 1
becomes 1
an 1
echo 1
of 1
some 1
one 1
else 1
s 1
music 1
an 1
actor 1
of 1
a 1
part 1
that 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
written 1
for 1
him 1
The 1
aim 1
of 1
life 1
is 1
self 1
development 1
To 1
realize 1
one 1
s 1
nature 1
perfectly 1
that 1
is 1
what 1
each 1
of 1
us 1
is 1
here 1
for 1
People 1
are 1
afraid 1
of 1
themselves 1
nowadays 1
They 1
have 1
forgotten 1
the 1
highest 1
of 1
all 1
duties 1
the 1
duty 1
that 1
one 1
owes 1
to 1
one 1
s 1
self 1
Of 1
course 1
they 1
are 1
charitable 1
They 1
feed 1
the 1
hungry 1
and 1
clothe 1
the 1
beggar 1
But 1
their 1
own 1
souls 1
starve 1
and 1
are 1
naked 1
Courage 1
has 1
gone 1
out 1
of 1
our 1
race 1
Perhaps 1
we 1
never 1
really 1
had 1
it 1
The 1
terror 1
of 1
society 1
which 1
is 1
the 1
basis 1
of 1
morals 1
the 1
terror 1
of 1
God 1
which 1
is 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
religion 1
these 1
are 1
the 1
two 1
things 1
that 1
govern 1
us 1
And 1
yet 1
Just 1
turn 1
your 1
head 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
Dorian 1
like 1
a 1
good 1
boy 1
said 1
the 1
painter 1
deep 1
in 1
his 1
work 1
and 1
conscious 1
only 1
that 1
a 1
look 1
had 1
come 1
into 1
the 1
lad 1
s 1
face 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
there 1
before 1
And 1
yet 1
continued 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
in 1
his 1
low 1
musical 1
voice 1
and 1
with 1
that 1
graceful 1
wave 1
of 1
the 1
hand 1
that 1
was 1
always 1
so 1
characteristic 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
even 1
in 1
his 1
Eton 1
days 1
I 1
believe 1
that 1
if 1
one 1
man 1
were 1
to 1
live 1
out 1
his 1
life 1
fully 1
and 1
completely 1
were 1
to 1
give 1
form 1
to 1
every 1
feeling 1
expression 1
to 1
every 1
thought 1
reality 1
to 1
every 1
dream 1
I 1
believe 1
that 1
the 1
world 1
would 1
gain 1
such 1
a 1
fresh 1
impulse 1
of 1
joy 1
that 1
we 1
would 1
forget 1
all 1
the 1
maladies 1
of 1
mediaevalism 1
and 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
Hellenic 1
ideal 1
to 1
something 1
finer 1
richer 1
than 1
the 1
Hellenic 1
ideal 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
But 1
the 1
bravest 1
man 1
amongst 1
us 1
is 1
afraid 1
of 1
himself 1
The 1
mutilation 1
of 1
the 1
savage 1
has 1
its 1
tragic 1
survival 1
in 1
the 1
self 1
denial 1
that 1
mars 1
our 1
lives 1
We 1
are 1
punished 1
for 1
our 1
refusals 1
Every 1
impulse 1
that 1
we 1
strive 1
to 1
strangle 1
broods 1
in 1
the 1
mind 1
and 1
poisons 1
us 1
The 1
body 1
sins 1
once 1
and 1
has 1
done 1
with 1
its 1
sin 1
for 1
action 1
is 1
a 1
mode 1
of 1
purification 1
Nothing 1
remains 1
then 1
but 1
the 1
recollection 1
of 1
a 1
pleasure 1
or 1
the 1
luxury 1
of 1
a 1
regret 1
The 1
only 1
way 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
a 1
temptation 1
is 1
to 1
yield 1
to 1
it 1
Resist 1
it 1
and 1
your 1
soul 1
grows 1
sick 1
with 1
longing 1
for 1
the 1
things 1
it 1
has 1
forbidden 1
to 1
itself 1
with 1
desire 1
for 1
what 1
its 1
monstrous 1
laws 1
have 1
made 1
monstrous 1
and 1
unlawful 1
It 1
has 1
been 1
said 1
that 1
the 1
great 1
events 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
take 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
brain 1
It 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
brain 1
and 1
the 1
brain 1
only 1
that 1
the 1
great 1
sins 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
take 1
place 1
also 1
You 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
you 1
yourself 1
with 1
your 1
rose 1
red 1
youth 1
and 1
your 1
rose 1
white 1
boyhood 1
you 1
have 1
had 1
passions 1
that 1
have 1
made 1
you 1
afraid 1
thoughts 1
that 1
have 1
filled 1
you 1
with 1
terror 1
day 1
dreams 1
and 1
sleeping 1
dreams 1
whose 1
mere 1
memory 1
might 1
stain 1
your 1
cheek 1
with 1
shame 1
Stop 1
faltered 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
stop 1
you 1
bewilder 1
me 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
There 1
is 1
some 1
answer 1
to 1
you 1
but 1
I 1
cannot 1
find 1
it 1
Don 1
t 1
speak 1
Let 1
me 1
think 1
Or 1
rather 1
let 1
me 1
try 1
not 1
to 1
think 1
For 1
nearly 1
ten 1
minutes 1
he 1
stood 1
there 1
motionless 1
with 1
parted 1
lips 1
and 1
eyes 1
strangely 1
bright 1
He 1
was 1
dimly 1
conscious 1
that 1
entirely 1
fresh 1
influences 1
were 1
at 1
work 1
within 1
him 1
Yet 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
have 1
come 1
really 1
from 1
himself 1
The 1
few 1
words 1
that 1
Basil 1
s 1
friend 1
had 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
words 1
spoken 1
by 1
chance 1
no 1
doubt 1
and 1
with 1
wilful 1
paradox 1
in 1
them 1
had 1
touched 1
some 1
secret 1
chord 1
that 1
had 1
never 1
been 1
touched 1
before 1
but 1
that 1
he 1
felt 1
was 1
now 1
vibrating 1
and 1
throbbing 1
to 1
curious 1
pulses 1
Music 1
had 1
stirred 1
him 1
like 1
that 1
Music 1
had 1
troubled 1
him 1
many 1
times 1
But 1
music 1
was 1
not 1
articulate 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
new 1
world 1
but 1
rather 1
another 1
chaos 1
that 1
it 1
created 1
in 1
us 1
Words 1
Mere 1
words 1
How 1
terrible 1
they 1
were 1
How 1
clear 1
and 1
vivid 1
and 1
cruel 1
One 1
could 1
not 1
escape 1
from 1
them 1
And 1
yet 1
what 1
a 1
subtle 1
magic 1
there 1
was 1
in 1
them 1
They 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
give 1
a 1
plastic 1
form 1
to 1
formless 1
things 1
and 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
music 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
as 1
sweet 1
as 1
that 1
of 1
viol 1
or 1
of 1
lute 1
Mere 1
words 1
Was 1
there 1
anything 1
so 1
real 1
as 1
words 1
Yes 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
things 1
in 1
his 1
boyhood 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
understood 1
He 1
understood 1
them 1
now 1
Life 1
suddenly 1
became 1
fiery 1
coloured 1
to 1
him 1
It 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
walking 1
in 1
fire 1
Why 1
had 1
he 1
not 1
known 1
it 1
With 1
his 1
subtle 1
smile 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
watched 1
him 1
He 1
knew 1
the 1
precise 1
psychological 1
moment 1
when 1
to 1
say 1
nothing 1
He 1
felt 1
intensely 1
interested 1
He 1
was 1
amazed 1
at 1
the 1
sudden 1
impression 1
that 1
his 1
words 1
had 1
produced 1
and 1
remembering 1
a 1
book 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
read 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
sixteen 1
a 1
book 1
which 1
had 1
revealed 1
to 1
him 1
much 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
known 1
before 1
he 1
wondered 1
whether 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
was 1
passing 1
through 1
a 1
similar 1
experience 1
He 1
had 1
merely 1
shot 1
an 1
arrow 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
Had 1
it 1
hit 1
the 1
mark 1
How 1
fascinating 1
the 1
lad 1
was 1
Hallward 1
painted 1
away 1
with 1
that 1
marvellous 1
bold 1
touch 1
of 1
his 1
that 1
had 1
the 1
true 1
refinement 1
and 1
perfect 1
delicacy 1
that 1
in 1
art 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
comes 1
only 1
from 1
strength 1
He 1
was 1
unconscious 1
of 1
the 1
silence 1
Basil 1
I 1
am 1
tired 1
of 1
standing 1
cried 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
suddenly 1
I 1
must 1
go 1
out 1
and 1
sit 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
The 1
air 1
is 1
stifling 1
here 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
sorry 1
When 1
I 1
am 1
painting 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
think 1
of 1
anything 1
else 1
But 1
you 1
never 1
sat 1
better 1
You 1
were 1
perfectly 1
still 1
And 1
I 1
have 1
caught 1
the 1
effect 1
I 1
wanted 1
the 1
half 1
parted 1
lips 1
and 1
the 1
bright 1
look 1
in 1
the 1
eyes 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
Harry 1
has 1
been 1
saying 1
to 1
you 1
but 1
he 1
has 1
certainly 1
made 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
most 1
wonderful 1
expression 1
I 1
suppose 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
paying 1
you 1
compliments 1
You 1
mustn 1
t 1
believe 1
a 1
word 1
that 1
he 1
says 1
He 1
has 1
certainly 1
not 1
been 1
paying 1
me 1
compliments 1
Perhaps 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
reason 1
that 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
believe 1
anything 1
he 1
has 1
told 1
me 1
You 1
know 1
you 1
believe 1
it 1
all 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
looking 1
at 1
him 1
with 1
his 1
dreamy 1
languorous 1
eyes 1
I 1
will 1
go 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
garden 1
with 1
you 1
It 1
is 1
horribly 1
hot 1
in 1
the 1
studio 1
Basil 1
let 1
us 1
have 1
something 1
iced 1
to 1
drink 1
something 1
with 1
strawberries 1
in 1
it 1
Certainly 1
Harry 1
Just 1
touch 1
the 1
bell 1
and 1
when 1
Parker 1
comes 1
I 1
will 1
tell 1
him 1
what 1
you 1
want 1
I 1
have 1
got 1
to 1
work 1
up 1
this 1
background 1
so 1
I 1
will 1
join 1
you 1
later 1
on 1
Don 1
t 1
keep 1
Dorian 1
too 1
long 1
I 1
have 1
never 1
been 1
in 1
better 1
form 1
for 1
painting 1
than 1
I 1
am 1
to 1
day 1
This 1
is 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
my 1
masterpiece 1
It 1
is 1
my 1
masterpiece 1
as 1
it 1
stands 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
went 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
found 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
burying 1
his 1
face 1
in 1
the 1
great 1
cool 1
lilac 1
blossoms 1
feverishly 1
drinking 1
in 1
their 1
perfume 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
wine 1
He 1
came 1
close 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
his 1
shoulder 1
You 1
are 1
quite 1
right 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
he 1
murmured 1
Nothing 1
can 1
cure 1
the 1
soul 1
but 1
the 1
senses 1
just 1
as 1
nothing 1
can 1
cure 1
the 1
senses 1
but 1
the 1
soul 1
The 1
lad 1
started 1
and 1
drew 1
back 1
He 1
was 1
bareheaded 1
and 1
the 1
leaves 1
had 1
tossed 1
his 1
rebellious 1
curls 1
and 1
tangled 1
all 1
their 1
gilded 1
threads 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
fear 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
such 1
as 1
people 1
have 1
when 1
they 1
are 1
suddenly 1
awakened 1
His 1
finely 1
chiselled 1
nostrils 1
quivered 1
and 1
some 1
hidden 1
nerve 1
shook 1
the 1
scarlet 1
of 1
his 1
lips 1
and 1
left 1
them 1
trembling 1
Yes 1
continued 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
that 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
secrets 1
of 1
life 1
to 1
cure 1
the 1
soul 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
the 1
senses 1
and 1
the 1
senses 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
the 1
soul 1
You 1
are 1
a 1
wonderful 1
creation 1
You 1
know 1
more 1
than 1
you 1
think 1
you 1
know 1
just 1
as 1
you 1
know 1
less 1
than 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
know 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
frowned 1
and 1
turned 1
his 1
head 1
away 1
He 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
liking 1
the 1
tall 1
graceful 1
young 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
standing 1
by 1
him 1
His 1
romantic 1
olive 1
coloured 1
face 1
and 1
worn 1
expression 1
interested 1
him 1
There 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
his 1
low 1
languid 1
voice 1
that 1
was 1
absolutely 1
fascinating 1
His 1
cool 1
white 1
flowerlike 1
hands 1
even 1
had 1
a 1
curious 1
charm 1
They 1
moved 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
like 1
music 1
and 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
language 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
But 1
he 1
felt 1
afraid 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
ashamed 1
of 1
being 1
afraid 1
Why 1
had 1
it 1
been 1
left 1
for 1
a 1
stranger 1
to 1
reveal 1
him 1
to 1
himself 1
He 1
had 1
known 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
for 1
months 1
but 1
the 1
friendship 1
between 1
them 1
had 1
never 1
altered 1
him 1
Suddenly 1
there 1
had 1
come 1
some 1
one 1
across 1
his 1
life 1
who 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
disclosed 1
to 1
him 1
life 1
s 1
mystery 1
And 1
yet 1
what 1
was 1
there 1
to 1
be 1
afraid 1
of 1
He 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
schoolboy 1
or 1
a 1
girl 1
It 1
was 1
absurd 1
to 1
be 1
frightened 1
Let 1
us 1
go 1
and 1
sit 1
in 1
the 1
shade 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Parker 1
has 1
brought 1
out 1
the 1
drinks 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
stay 1
any 1
longer 1
in 1
this 1
glare 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
quite 1
spoiled 1
and 1
Basil 1
will 1
never 1
paint 1
you 1
again 1
You 1
really 1
must 1
not 1
allow 1
yourself 1
to 1
become 1
sunburnt 1
It 1
would 1
be 1
unbecoming 1
What 1
can 1
it 1
matter 1
cried 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
laughing 1
as 1
he 1
sat 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
seat 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
garden 1
It 1
should 1
matter 1
everything 1
to 1
you 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
Why 1
Because 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
most 1
marvellous 1
youth 1
and 1
youth 1
is 1
the 1
one 1
thing 1
worth 1
having 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
feel 1
that 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
No 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
feel 1
it 1
now 1
Some 1
day 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
old 1
and 1
wrinkled 1
and 1
ugly 1
when 1
thought 1
has 1
seared 1
your 1
forehead 1
with 1
its 1
lines 1
and 1
passion 1
branded 1
your 1
lips 1
with 1
its 1
hideous 1
fires 1
you 1
will 1
feel 1
it 1
you 1
will 1
feel 1
it 1
terribly 1
Now 1
wherever 1
you 1
go 1
you 1
charm 1
the 1
world 1
Will 1
it 1
always 1
be 1
so 1
You 1
have 1
a 1
wonderfully 1
beautiful 1
face 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
Don 1
t 1
frown 1
You 1
have 1
And 1
beauty 1
is 1
a 1
form 1
of 1
genius 1
is 1
higher 1
indeed 1
than 1
genius 1
as 1
it 1
needs 1
no 1
explanation 1
It 1
is 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
facts 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
like 1
sunlight 1
or 1
spring 1
time 1
or 1
the 1
reflection 1
in 1
dark 1
waters 1
of 1
that 1
silver 1
shell 1
we 1
call 1
the 1
moon 1
It 1
cannot 1
be 1
questioned 1
It 1
has 1
its 1
divine 1
right 1
of 1
sovereignty 1
It 1
makes 1
princes 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
have 1
it 1
You 1
smile 1
Ah 1
when 1
you 1
have 1
lost 1
it 1
you 1
won 1
t 1
smile 1
People 1
say 1
sometimes 1
that 1
beauty 1
is 1
only 1
superficial 1
That 1
may 1
be 1
so 1
but 1
at 1
least 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
so 1
superficial 1
as 1
thought 1
is 1
To 1
me 1
beauty 1
is 1
the 1
wonder 1
of 1
wonders 1
It 1
is 1
only 1
shallow 1
people 1
who 1
do 1
not 1
judge 1
by 1
appearances 1
The 1
true 1
mystery 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
is 1
the 1
visible 1
not 1
the 1
invisible 1
Yes 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
the 1
gods 1
have 1
been 1
good 1
to 1
you 1
But 1
what 1
the 1
gods 1
give 1
they 1
quickly 1
take 1
away 1
You 1
have 1
only 1
a 1
few 1
years 1
in 1
which 1
to 1
live 1
really 1
perfectly 1
and 1
fully 1
When 1
your 1
youth 1
goes 1
your 1
beauty 1
will 1
go 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
will 1
suddenly 1
discover 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
triumphs 1
left 1
for 1
you 1
or 1
have 1
to 1
content 1
yourself 1
with 1
those 1
mean 1
triumphs 1
that 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
your 1
past 1
will 1
make 1
more 1
bitter 1
than 1
defeats 1
Every 1
month 1
as 1
it 1
wanes 1
brings 1
you 1
nearer 1
to 1
something 1
dreadful 1
Time 1
is 1
jealous 1
of 1
you 1
and 1
wars 1
against 1
your 1
lilies 1
and 1
your 1
roses 1
You 1
will 1
become 1
sallow 1
and 1
hollow 1
cheeked 1
and 1
dull 1
eyed 1
You 1
will 1
suffer 1
horribly 1
Ah 1
realize 1
your 1
youth 1
while 1
you 1
have 1
it 1
Don 1
t 1
squander 1
the 1
gold 1
of 1
your 1
days 1
listening 1
to 1
the 1
tedious 1
trying 1
to 1
improve 1
the 1
hopeless 1
failure 1
or 1
giving 1
away 1
your 1
life 1
to 1
the 1
ignorant 1
the 1
common 1
and 1
the 1
vulgar 1
These 1
are 1
the 1
sickly 1
aims 1
the 1
false 1
ideals 1
of 1
our 1
age 1
Live 2
the 1
wonderful 1
life 1
that 1
is 1
in 1
you 1
Let 1
nothing 1
be 1
lost 1
upon 1
you 1
Be 1
always 1
searching 1
for 1
new 1
sensations 1
Be 1
afraid 1
of 1
nothing 1
A 1
new 1
Hedonism 1
that 1
is 1
what 1
our 1
century 1
wants 1
You 1
might 1
be 1
its 1
visible 1
symbol 1
With 1
your 1
personality 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
you 1
could 1
not 1
do 1
The 1
world 1
belongs 1
to 1
you 1
for 1
a 1
season 1
The 1
moment 1
I 1
met 1
you 1
I 1
saw 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
quite 1
unconscious 1
of 1
what 1
you 1
really 1
are 1
of 1
what 1
you 1
really 1
might 1
be 1
There 1
was 1
so 1
much 1
in 1
you 1
that 1
charmed 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
felt 1
I 1
must 1
tell 1
you 1
something 1
about 1
yourself 1
I 1
thought 1
how 1
tragic 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
wasted 1
For 1
there 1
is 1
such 1
a 1
little 1
time 1
that 1
your 1
youth 1
will 1
last 1
such 1
a 1
little 1
time 1
The 1
common 1
hill 1
flowers 1
wither 1
but 1
they 1
blossom 1
again 1
The 1
laburnum 1
will 1
be 1
as 1
yellow 1
next 1
June 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
now 1
In 1
a 1
month 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
purple 1
stars 1
on 1
the 1
clematis 1
and 1
year 1
after 1
year 1
the 1
green 1
night 1
of 1
its 1
leaves 1
will 1
hold 1
its 1
purple 1
stars 1
But 1
we 1
never 1
get 1
back 1
our 1
youth 1
The 1
pulse 1
of 1
joy 1
that 1
beats 1
in 1
us 1
at 1
twenty 1
becomes 1
sluggish 1
Our 1
limbs 1
fail 1
our 1
senses 1
rot 1
We 1
degenerate 1
into 1
hideous 1
puppets 1
haunted 1
by 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
passions 1
of 1
which 1
we 1
were 1
too 1
much 1
afraid 1
and 1
the 1
exquisite 1
temptations 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
not 1
the 1
courage 1
to 1
yield 1
to 1
Youth 2
There 1
is 1
absolutely 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
but 1
youth 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
listened 1
open 1
eyed 1
and 1
wondering 1
The 1
spray 1
of 1
lilac 1
fell 1
from 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
the 1
gravel 1
A 1
furry 1
bee 1
came 1
and 1
buzzed 1
round 1
it 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
Then 1
it 1
began 1
to 1
scramble 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
oval 1
stellated 1
globe 1
of 1
the 1
tiny 1
blossoms 1
He 1
watched 1
it 1
with 1
that 1
strange 1
interest 1
in 1
trivial 1
things 1
that 1
we 1
try 1
to 1
develop 1
when 1
things 1
of 1
high 1
import 1
make 1
us 1
afraid 1
or 1
when 1
we 1
are 1
stirred 1
by 1
some 1
new 1
emotion 1
for 1
which 1
we 1
cannot 1
find 1
expression 1
or 1
when 1
some 1
thought 1
that 1
terrifies 1
us 1
lays 1
sudden 1
siege 1
to 1
the 1
brain 1
and 1
calls 1
on 1
us 1
to 1
yield 1
After 1
a 1
time 1
the 1
bee 1
flew 1
away 1
He 1
saw 1
it 1
creeping 1
into 1
the 1
stained 1
trumpet 1
of 1
a 1
Tyrian 1
convolvulus 1
The 1
flower 1
seemed 1
to 1
quiver 1
and 1
then 1
swayed 1
gently 1
to 1
and 1
fro 1
Suddenly 1
the 1
painter 1
appeared 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
studio 1
and 1
made 1
staccato 1
signs 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
come 1
in 1
They 1
turned 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
smiled 1
I 1
am 1
waiting 1
he 1
cried 1
Do 1
come 1
in 1
The 1
light 1
is 1
quite 1
perfect 1
and 1
you 1
can 1
bring 1
your 1
drinks 1
They 1
rose 1
up 1
and 1
sauntered 1
down 1
the 1
walk 1
together 1
Two 1
green 1
and 1
white 1
butterflies 1
fluttered 1
past 1
them 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
pear 1
tree 1
at 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
garden 1
a 1
thrush 1
began 1
to 1
sing 1
You 1
are 1
glad 1
you 1
have 1
met 1
me 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
looking 1
at 1
him 1
Yes 1
I 1
am 1
glad 1
now 1
I 1
wonder 1
shall 1
I 1
always 1
be 1
glad 1
Always 1
That 1
is 1
a 1
dreadful 1
word 1
It 1
makes 1
me 1
shudder 1
when 1
I 1
hear 1
it 1
Women 1
are 1
so 1
fond 1
of 1
using 1
it 1
They 1
spoil 1
every 1
romance 1
by 1
trying 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
last 1
for 1
ever 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
meaningless 1
word 1
too 1
The 1
only 1
difference 1
between 1
a 1
caprice 1
and 1
a 1
lifelong 1
passion 1
is 1
that 1
the 1
caprice 1
lasts 1
a 1
little 1
longer 1
As 1
they 1
entered 1
the 1
studio 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
s 1
arm 1
In 1
that 1
case 1
let 1
our 1
friendship 1
be 1
a 1
caprice 1
he 1
murmured 1
flushing 1
at 1
his 1
own 1
boldness 1
then 1
stepped 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
platform 1
and 1
resumed 1
his 1
pose 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
flung 1
himself 1
into 1
a 1
large 1
wicker 1
arm 1
chair 1
and 1
watched 1
him 1
The 1
sweep 1
and 1
dash 1
of 1
the 1
brush 1
on 1
the 1
canvas 1
made 1
the 1
only 1
sound 1
that 1
broke 1
the 1
stillness 1
except 1
when 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
Hallward 1
stepped 1
back 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
his 1
work 1
from 1
a 1
distance 1
In 1
the 1
slanting 1
beams 1
that 1
streamed 1
through 1
the 1
open 1
doorway 1
the 1
dust 1
danced 1
and 1
was 1
golden 1
The 1
heavy 1
scent 1
of 1
the 1
roses 1
seemed 1
to 1
brood 1
over 1
everything 1
After 1
about 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
Hallward 1
stopped 1
painting 1
looked 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
at 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
and 1
then 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
at 1
the 1
picture 1
biting 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
huge 1
brushes 1
and 1
frowning 1
It 1
is 1
quite 1
finished 1
he 1
cried 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
stooping 1
down 1
he 1
wrote 1
his 1
name 1
in 1
long 1
vermilion 1
letters 1
on 1
the 1
left 1
hand 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
canvas 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
came 1
over 1
and 1
examined 1
the 1
picture 1
It 1
was 1
certainly 1
a 1
wonderful 1
work 1
of 1
art 1
and 1
a 1
wonderful 1
likeness 1
as 1
well 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
I 1
congratulate 1
you 1
most 1
warmly 1
he 1
said 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
finest 1
portrait 1
of 1
modern 1
times 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
come 1
over 1
and 1
look 1
at 1
yourself 1
The 1
lad 1
started 1
as 1
if 1
awakened 1
from 1
some 1
dream 1
Is 1
it 1
really 1
finished 1
he 1
murmured 1
stepping 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
platform 1
Quite 1
finished 1
said 1
the 1
painter 1
And 1
you 1
have 1
sat 1
splendidly 1
to 1
day 1
I 1
am 1
awfully 1
obliged 1
to 1
you 1
That 1
is 1
entirely 1
due 1
to 1
me 1
broke 1
in 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Isn 1
t 1
it 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
Dorian 1
made 1
no 1
answer 1
but 1
passed 1
listlessly 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
his 1
picture 1
and 1
turned 1
towards 1
it 1
When 1
he 1
saw 1
it 1
he 1
drew 1
back 1
and 1
his 1
cheeks 1
flushed 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
with 1
pleasure 1
A 1
look 1
of 1
joy 1
came 1
into 1
his 1
eyes 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
recognized 1
himself 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
He 1
stood 1
there 1
motionless 1
and 1
in 1
wonder 1
dimly 1
conscious 1
that 1
Hallward 1
was 1
speaking 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
not 1
catching 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
his 1
words 1
The 1
sense 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
beauty 1
came 1
on 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
revelation 1
He 1
had 1
never 1
felt 1
it 1
before 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
s 1
compliments 1
had 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
merely 1
the 1
charming 1
exaggeration 1
of 1
friendship 1
He 1
had 1
listened 1
to 1
them 1
laughed 1
at 1
them 1
forgotten 1
them 1
They 1
had 1
not 1
influenced 1
his 1
nature 1
Then 1
had 1
come 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Wotton 1
with 1
his 1
strange 1
panegyric 1
on 1
youth 1
his 1
terrible 1
warning 1
of 1
its 1
brevity 1
That 1
had 1
stirred 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
now 1
as 1
he 1
stood 1
gazing 1
at 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
loveliness 1
the 1
full 1
reality 1
of 1
the 1
description 1
flashed 1
across 1
him 1
Yes 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
day 1
when 1
his 1
face 1
would 1
be 1
wrinkled 1
and 1
wizen 1
his 1
eyes 1
dim 1
and 1
colourless 1
the 1
grace 1
of 1
his 1
figure 1
broken 1
and 1
deformed 1
The 1
scarlet 1
would 1
pass 1
away 1
from 1
his 1
lips 1
and 1
the 1
gold 1
steal 1
from 1
his 1
hair 1
The 1
life 1
that 1
was 1
to 1
make 1
his 1
soul 1
would 1
mar 1
his 1
body 1
He 1
would 1
become 1
dreadful 1
hideous 1
and 1
uncouth 1
As 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
it 1
a 1
sharp 1
pang 1
of 1
pain 1
struck 1
through 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
knife 1
and 1
made 1
each 1
delicate 1
fibre 1
of 1
his 1
nature 1
quiver 1
His 1
eyes 1
deepened 1
into 1
amethyst 1
and 1
across 1
them 1
came 1
a 1
mist 1
of 1
tears 1
He 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
a 1
hand 1
of 1
ice 1
had 1
been 1
laid 1
upon 1
his 1
heart 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
like 1
it 1
cried 1
Hallward 1
at 1
last 1
stung 1
a 1
little 1
by 1
the 1
lad 1
s 1
silence 1
not 1
understanding 1
what 1
it 1
meant 1
Of 1
course 1
he 1
likes 1
it 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Who 1
wouldn 1
t 1
like 1
it 1
It 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
greatest 1
things 1
in 1
modern 1
art 1
I 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
anything 1
you 1
like 1
to 1
ask 1
for 1
it 1
I 1
must 1
have 1
it 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
my 1
property 1
Harry 1
Whose 1
property 1
is 1
it 1
Dorian 1
s 1
of 1
course 1
answered 1
the 1
painter 1
He 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
lucky 1
fellow 1
How 1
sad 1
it 1
is 1
murmured 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
with 1
his 1
eyes 1
still 1
fixed 1
upon 1
his 1
own 1
portrait 1
How 1
sad 1
it 1
is 1
I 1
shall 1
grow 1
old 1
and 1
horrible 1
and 1
dreadful 1
But 1
this 1
picture 1
will 1
remain 1
always 1
young 1
It 1
will 1
never 1
be 1
older 1
than 1
this 1
particular 1
day 1
of 1
June 1
If 1
it 1
were 1
only 1
the 1
other 1
way 1
If 1
it 1
were 1
I 1
who 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
always 1
young 1
and 1
the 1
picture 1
that 1
was 1
to 1
grow 1
old 1
For 1
that 1
for 1
that 1
I 1
would 1
give 1
everything 1
Yes 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
give 1
I 1
would 1
give 1
my 1
soul 1
for 1
that 1
You 1
would 1
hardly 1
care 1
for 1
such 1
an 1
arrangement 1
Basil 1
cried 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
laughing 1
It 1
would 1
be 1
rather 1
hard 1
lines 1
on 1
your 1
work 1
I 1
should 1
object 1
very 1
strongly 1
Harry 1
said 1
Hallward 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
turned 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
I 1
believe 1
you 1
would 1
Basil 1
You 1
like 1
your 1
art 1
better 1
than 1
your 1
friends 1
I 1
am 1
no 1
more 1
to 1
you 1
than 1
a 1
green 1
bronze 1
figure 1
Hardly 1
as 1
much 1
I 1
dare 1
say 1
The 1
painter 1
stared 1
in 1
amazement 1
It 1
was 1
so 1
unlike 1
Dorian 1
to 1
speak 1
like 1
that 1
What 1
had 1
happened 1
He 1
seemed 1
quite 1
angry 1
His 1
face 1
was 1
flushed 1
and 1
his 1
cheeks 1
burning 1
Yes 1
he 1
continued 1
I 1
am 1
less 1
to 1
you 1
than 1
your 1
ivory 1
Hermes 1
or 1
your 1
silver 1
Faun 1
You 1
will 1
like 1
them 1
always 1
How 1
long 1
will 1
you 1
like 1
me 1
Till 1
I 1
have 1
my 1
first 1
wrinkle 1
I 1
suppose 1
I 1
know 1
now 1
that 1
when 1
one 1
loses 1
one 1
s 1
good 1
looks 1
whatever 1
they 1
may 1
be 1
one 1
loses 1
everything 1
Your 1
picture 1
has 1
taught 1
me 1
that 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Wotton 1
is 1
perfectly 1
right 1
Youth 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
worth 1
having 1
When 1
I 1
find 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
growing 1
old 1
I 1
shall 1
kill 1
myself 1
Hallward 1
turned 1
pale 1
and 1
caught 1
his 1
hand 1
Dorian 2
he 1
cried 1
don 1
t 1
talk 1
like 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
never 1
had 1
such 1
a 1
friend 1
as 1
you 1
and 1
I 1
shall 1
never 1
have 1
such 1
another 1
You 1
are 1
not 1
jealous 1
of 1
material 1
things 1
are 1
you 2
who 1
are 1
finer 1
than 1
any 1
of 1
them 1
I 1
am 1
jealous 1
of 1
everything 1
whose 1
beauty 1
does 1
not 1
die 1
I 1
am 1
jealous 1
of 1
the 1
portrait 1
you 1
have 1
painted 1
of 1
me 1
Why 1
should 1
it 1
keep 1
what 1
I 1
must 1
lose 1
Every 1
moment 1
that 1
passes 1
takes 1
something 1
from 1
me 1
and 1
gives 1
something 1
to 1
it 1
Oh 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
only 1
the 1
other 1
way 1
If 1
the 1
picture 1
could 1
change 1
and 1
I 1
could 1
be 1
always 1
what 1
I 1
am 1
now 1
Why 1
did 1
you 1
paint 1
it 1
It 1
will 1
mock 1
me 1
some 1
day 1
mock 1
me 1
horribly 1
The 1
hot 1
tears 1
welled 1
into 1
his 1
eyes 1
he 1
tore 1
his 1
hand 1
away 1
and 1
flinging 1
himself 1
on 1
the 1
divan 1
he 1
buried 1
his 1
face 1
in 1
the 1
cushions 1
as 1
though 1
he 1
was 1
praying 1
This 1
is 1
your 1
doing 1
Harry 1
said 1
the 1
painter 1
bitterly 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
real 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
If 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
what 1
have 1
I 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
You 1
should 1
have 1
gone 1
away 1
when 1
I 1
asked 1
you 1
he 1
muttered 1
I 1
stayed 1
when 1
you 1
asked 1
me 1
was 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
s 1
answer 1
Harry 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
quarrel 1
with 1
my 1
two 1
best 1
friends 1
at 1
once 1
but 1
between 1
you 1
both 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
me 1
hate 1
the 1
finest 1
piece 1
of 1
work 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
done 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
destroy 1
it 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
but 1
canvas 1
and 1
colour 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
let 1
it 1
come 1
across 1
our 1
three 1
lives 1
and 1
mar 1
them 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
lifted 1
his 1
golden 1
head 1
from 1
the 1
pillow 1
and 1
with 1
pallid 1
face 1
and 1
tear 1
stained 1
eyes 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
walked 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
deal 1
painting 1
table 1
that 1
was 1
set 1
beneath 1
the 1
high 1
curtained 1
window 1
What 1
was 1
he 1
doing 1
there 1
His 1
fingers 1
were 1
straying 1
about 1
among 1
the 1
litter 1
of 1
tin 1
tubes 1
and 1
dry 1
brushes 1
seeking 1
for 1
something 1
Yes 1
it 1
was 1
for 1
the 1
long 1
palette 1
knife 1
with 1
its 1
thin 1
blade 1
of 1
lithe 1
steel 1
He 1
had 1
found 1
it 1
at 1
last 1
He 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
rip 1
up 1
the 1
canvas 1
With 1
a 1
stifled 1
sob 1
the 1
lad 1
leaped 1
from 1
the 1
couch 1
and 1
rushing 1
over 1
to 1
Hallward 1
tore 1
the 1
knife 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
flung 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
studio 1
Don 1
t 1
Basil 1
don 1
t 1
he 1
cried 1
It 1
would 1
be 1
murder 1
I 1
am 1
glad 1
you 1
appreciate 1
my 1
work 1
at 1
last 1
Dorian 1
said 1
the 1
painter 1
coldly 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
recovered 1
from 1
his 1
surprise 1
I 1
never 1
thought 1
you 1
would 1
Appreciate 1
it 1
I 1
am 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
it 1
Basil 1
It 1
is 1
part 1
of 1
myself 1
I 1
feel 1
that 1
Well 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
dry 1
you 1
shall 1
be 1
varnished 1
and 1
framed 1
and 1
sent 1
home 1
Then 1
you 1
can 1
do 1
what 1
you 1
like 1
with 1
yourself 1
And 1
he 1
walked 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
rang 1
the 1
bell 1
for 1
tea 1
You 1
will 1
have 1
tea 1
of 1
course 1
Dorian 1
And 1
so 1
will 1
you 1
Harry 1
Or 1
do 1
you 1
object 1
to 1
such 1
simple 1
pleasures 1
I 1
adore 1
simple 1
pleasures 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
They 1
are 1
the 1
last 1
refuge 1
of 1
the 1
complex 1
But 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
scenes 1
except 1
on 1
the 1
stage 1
What 1
absurd 1
fellows 1
you 1
are 1
both 1
of 1
you 1
I 1
wonder 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
defined 1
man 1
as 1
a 1
rational 1
animal 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
premature 1
definition 1
ever 1
given 1
Man 1
is 1
many 1
things 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
rational 1
I 1
am 1
glad 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
after 1
all 1
though 1
I 1
wish 1
you 1
chaps 1
would 1
not 1
squabble 1
over 1
the 1
picture 1
You 1
had 1
much 1
better 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
it 1
Basil 1
This 1
silly 1
boy 1
doesn 1
t 1
really 1
want 1
it 1
and 1
I 1
really 1
do 1
If 1
you 1
let 1
any 1
one 1
have 1
it 1
but 1
me 1
Basil 1
I 1
shall 1
never 1
forgive 1
you 1
cried 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
and 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
allow 1
people 1
to 1
call 1
me 1
a 1
silly 1
boy 1
You 1
know 1
the 1
picture 1
is 1
yours 1
Dorian 1
I 1
gave 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
before 1
it 1
existed 1
And 1
you 1
know 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
little 1
silly 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
really 1
object 1
to 1
being 1
reminded 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
extremely 1
young 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
objected 1
very 1
strongly 1
this 1
morning 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Ah 1
this 1
morning 1
You 1
have 1
lived 1
since 1
then 1
There 1
came 1
a 1
knock 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
the 1
butler 1
entered 1
with 1
a 1
laden 1
tea 1
tray 1
and 1
set 1
it 1
down 1
upon 1
a 1
small 1
Japanese 1
table 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
rattle 1
of 1
cups 1
and 1
saucers 1
and 1
the 1
hissing 1
of 1
a 1
fluted 1
Georgian 1
urn 1
Two 1
globe 1
shaped 1
china 1
dishes 1
were 1
brought 1
in 1
by 1
a 1
page 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
went 1
over 1
and 1
poured 1
out 1
the 1
tea 1
The 1
two 1
men 1
sauntered 1
languidly 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
examined 1
what 1
was 1
under 1
the 1
covers 1
Let 1
us 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
theatre 1
to 1
night 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
There 1
is 1
sure 1
to 1
be 1
something 1
on 1
somewhere 1
I 1
have 1
promised 1
to 1
dine 1
at 1
White 1
s 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
with 1
an 1
old 1
friend 1
so 1
I 1
can 1
send 1
him 1
a 1
wire 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
ill 1
or 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
prevented 1
from 1
coming 1
in 1
consequence 1
of 1
a 1
subsequent 1
engagement 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
rather 1
nice 1
excuse 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
all 1
the 1
surprise 1
of 1
candour 1
It 1
is 1
such 1
a 1
bore 1
putting 1
on 1
one 1
s 1
dress 1
clothes 1
muttered 1
Hallward 1
And 1
when 1
one 1
has 1
them 1
on 1
they 1
are 1
so 1
horrid 1
Yes 1
answered 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
dreamily 1
the 1
costume 1
of 1
the 1
nineteenth 1
century 1
is 1
detestable 1
It 1
is 1
so 1
sombre 1
so 1
depressing 1
Sin 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
real 1
colour 1
element 1
left 1
in 1
modern 1
life 1
You 1
really 1
must 1
not 1
say 1
things 1
like 1
that 1
before 1
Dorian 1
Harry 1
Before 1
which 1
Dorian 1
The 1
one 1
who 1
is 1
pouring 1
out 1
tea 1
for 1
us 1
or 1
the 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
picture 1
Before 1
either 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
theatre 1
with 1
you 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
said 1
the 1
lad 1
Then 1
you 1
shall 1
come 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
come 1
too 1
Basil 1
won 1
t 1
you 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
really 1
I 1
would 1
sooner 1
not 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
work 1
to 1
do 1
Well 1
then 1
you 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
go 1
alone 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
that 1
awfully 1
The 1
painter 1
bit 1
his 1
lip 1
and 1
walked 1
over 1
cup 1
in 1
hand 1
to 1
the 1
picture 1
I 1
shall 1
stay 1
with 1
the 1
real 1
Dorian 1
he 1
said 1
sadly 1
Is 1
it 1
the 1
real 1
Dorian 1
cried 1
the 1
original 1
of 1
the 1
portrait 1
strolling 1
across 1
to 1
him 1
Am 1
I 1
really 1
like 1
that 1
Yes 1
you 1
are 1
just 1
like 1
that 1
How 1
wonderful 1
Basil 1
At 1
least 1
you 1
are 1
like 1
it 1
in 1
appearance 1
But 1
it 1
will 1
never 1
alter 1
sighed 1
Hallward 1
That 1
is 1
something 1
What 1
a 1
fuss 1
people 1
make 1
about 1
fidelity 1
exclaimed 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Why 1
even 1
in 1
love 1
it 1
is 1
purely 1
a 1
question 1
for 1
physiology 1
It 1
has 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
our 1
own 1
will 1
Young 1
men 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
faithful 1
and 1
are 1
not 1
old 1
men 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
faithless 1
and 1
cannot 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
one 1
can 1
say 1
Don 1
t 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
theatre 1
to 1
night 1
Dorian 1
said 1
Hallward 1
Stop 1
and 1
dine 1
with 1
me 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
Basil 1
Why 1
Because 1
I 1
have 1
promised 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Wotton 1
to 1
go 1
with 1
him 1
He 1
won 1
t 1
like 1
you 1
the 1
better 1
for 1
keeping 1
your 1
promises 1
He 1
always 1
breaks 1
his 1
own 1
I 1
beg 1
you 1
not 1
to 1
go 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
laughed 1
and 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
I 1
entreat 1
you 1
The 1
lad 1
hesitated 1
and 1
looked 1
over 1
at 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
who 1
was 1
watching 1
them 1
from 1
the 1
tea 1
table 1
with 1
an 1
amused 1
smile 1
I 1
must 1
go 1
Basil 1
he 1
answered 1
Very 1
well 1
said 1
Hallward 1
and 1
he 1
went 1
over 1
and 1
laid 1
down 1
his 1
cup 1
on 1
the 1
tray 1
It 1
is 1
rather 1
late 1
and 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
dress 1
you 1
had 1
better 1
lose 1
no 1
time 1
Good 1
bye 1
Harry 1
Good 1
bye 1
Dorian 1
Come 1
and 1
see 1
me 1
soon 1
Come 1
to 1
morrow 1
Certainly 1
You 1
won 1
t 1
forget 1
No 1
of 1
course 1
not 1
cried 1
Dorian 1
And 1
Harry 1
Yes 1
Basil 1
Remember 1
what 1
I 1
asked 1
you 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
this 1
morning 1
I 1
have 1
forgotten 1
it 1
I 1
trust 1
you 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
could 1
trust 1
myself 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
laughing 1
Come 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
my 1
hansom 1
is 1
outside 1
and 1
I 1
can 1
drop 1
you 1
at 1
your 1
own 1
place 1
Good 1
bye 1
Basil 1
It 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
most 1
interesting 1
afternoon 1
As 1
the 1
door 1
closed 1
behind 1
them 1
the 1
painter 1
flung 1
himself 1
down 1
on 1
a 1
sofa 1
and 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
pain 1
came 1
into 1
his 1
face 1
CHAPTER 1
At 1
half 1
past 1
twelve 1
next 1
day 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Wotton 1
strolled 1
from 1
Curzon 1
Street 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
Albany 1
to 1
call 1
on 1
his 1
uncle 1
Lord 1
Fermor 1
a 1
genial 1
if 1
somewhat 1
rough 1
mannered 1
old 1
bachelor 1
whom 1
the 1
outside 1
world 1
called 1
selfish 1
because 1
it 1
derived 1
no 1
particular 1
benefit 1
from 1
him 1
but 1
who 1
was 1
considered 1
generous 1
by 1
Society 1
as 1
he 1
fed 1
the 1
people 1
who 1
amused 1
him 1
His 1
father 1
had 1
been 1
our 1
ambassador 1
at 1
Madrid 1
when 1
Isabella 1
was 1
young 1
and 1
Prim 1
unthought 1
of 1
but 1
had 1
retired 1
from 1
the 1
diplomatic 1
service 1
in 1
a 1
capricious 1
moment 1
of 1
annoyance 1
on 1
not 1
being 1
offered 1
the 1
Embassy 1
at 1
Paris 1
a 1
post 1
to 1
which 1
he 1
considered 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
fully 1
entitled 1
by 1
reason 1
of 1
his 1
birth 1
his 1
indolence 1
the 1
good 1
English 1
of 1
his 1
dispatches 1
and 1
his 1
inordinate 1
passion 1
for 1
pleasure 1
The 1
son 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
his 1
father 1
s 1
secretary 1
had 1
resigned 1
along 1
with 1
his 1
chief 1
somewhat 1
foolishly 1
as 1
was 1
thought 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
on 1
succeeding 1
some 1
months 1
later 1
to 1
the 1
title 1
had 1
set 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
serious 1
study 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
aristocratic 1
art 1
of 1
doing 1
absolutely 1
nothing 1
He 1
had 1
two 1
large 1
town 1
houses 1
but 1
preferred 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
chambers 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
less 1
trouble 1
and 1
took 1
most 1
of 1
his 1
meals 1
at 1
his 1
club 1
He 1
paid 1
some 1
attention 1
to 1
the 1
management 1
of 1
his 1
collieries 1
in 1
the 1
Midland 1
counties 1
excusing 1
himself 1
for 1
this 1
taint 1
of 1
industry 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
that 1
the 1
one 1
advantage 1
of 1
having 1
coal 1
was 1
that 1
it 1
enabled 1
a 1
gentleman 1
to 1
afford 1
the 1
decency 1
of 1
burning 1
wood 1
on 1
his 1
own 1
hearth 1
In 1
politics 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
Tory 1
except 1
when 1
the 1
Tories 1
were 1
in 1
office 1
during 1
which 1
period 1
he 1
roundly 1
abused 1
them 1
for 1
being 1
a 1
pack 1
of 1
Radicals 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
hero 1
to 1
his 1
valet 1
who 1
bullied 1
him 1
and 1
a 1
terror 1
to 1
most 1
of 1
his 1
relations 1
whom 1
he 1
bullied 1
in 1
turn 1
Only 1
England 1
could 1
have 1
produced 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
always 1
said 1
that 1
the 1
country 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
dogs 1
His 1
principles 1
were 1
out 1
of 1
date 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
to 1
be 1
said 1
for 1
his 1
prejudices 1
When 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
he 1
found 1
his 1
uncle 1
sitting 1
in 1
a 1
rough 1
shooting 1
coat 1
smoking 1
a 1
cheroot 1
and 1
grumbling 1
over 1
The 1
Times 1
Well 1
Harry 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
gentleman 1
what 1
brings 1
you 1
out 1
so 1
early 1
I 1
thought 1
you 1
dandies 1
never 1
got 1
up 1
till 1
two 1
and 1
were 1
not 1
visible 1
till 1
five 1
Pure 1
family 1
affection 1
I 1
assure 1
you 1
Uncle 1
George 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
get 1
something 1
out 1
of 1
you 1
Money 1
I 1
suppose 1
said 1
Lord 1
Fermor 1
making 1
a 1
wry 1
face 1
Well 1
sit 1
down 1
and 1
tell 1
me 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
Young 1
people 1
nowadays 1
imagine 1
that 1
money 1
is 1
everything 1
Yes 1
murmured 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
settling 1
his 1
button 1
hole 1
in 1
his 1
coat 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
grow 1
older 1
they 1
know 1
it 1
But 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
money 1
It 1
is 1
only 1
people 1
who 1
pay 1
their 1
bills 1
who 1
want 1
that 1
Uncle 1
George 1
and 1
I 1
never 1
pay 1
mine 1
Credit 1
is 1
the 1
capital 1
of 1
a 1
younger 1
son 1
and 1
one 1
lives 1
charmingly 1
upon 1
it 1
Besides 1
I 1
always 1
deal 1
with 1
Dartmoor 1
s 1
tradesmen 1
and 1
consequently 1
they 1
never 1
bother 1
me 1
What 1
I 1
want 1
is 1
information 1
not 1
useful 1
information 1
of 1
course 1
useless 1
information 1
Well 1
I 1
can 1
tell 1
you 1
anything 1
that 1
is 1
in 1
an 1
English 1
Blue 1
Book 1
Harry 1
although 1
those 1
fellows 1
nowadays 1
write 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
nonsense 1
When 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
Diplomatic 1
things 1
were 1
much 1
better 1
But 1
I 1
hear 1
they 1
let 1
them 1
in 1
now 1
by 1
examination 1
What 1
can 1
you 1
expect 1
Examinations 1
sir 1
are 1
pure 1
humbug 1
from 1
beginning 1
to 1
end 1
If 1
a 1
man 1
is 1
a 1
gentleman 1
he 1
knows 1
quite 1
enough 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
gentleman 1
whatever 1
he 1
knows 1
is 1
bad 1
for 1
him 1
Mr 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
does 1
not 1
belong 1
to 1
Blue 1
Books 1
Uncle 1
George 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
languidly 1
Mr 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
Who 1
is 1
he 1
asked 1
Lord 1
Fermor 1
knitting 1
his 1
bushy 1
white 1
eyebrows 1
That 1
is 1
what 1
I 1
have 1
come 1
to 1
learn 1
Uncle 1
George 1
Or 1
rather 1
I 1
know 1
who 1
he 1
is 1
He 1
is 1
the 1
last 1
Lord 1
Kelso 1
s 1
grandson 1
His 1
mother 1
was 1
a 1
Devereux 1
Lady 1
Margaret 1
Devereux 1
I 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
about 1
his 1
mother 1
What 1
was 1
she 1
like 1
Whom 1
did 1
she 1
marry 1
You 1
have 1
known 1
nearly 1
everybody 1
in 1
your 1
time 1
so 1
you 1
might 1
have 1
known 1
her 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
much 1
interested 1
in 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
at 1
present 1
I 1
have 1
only 1
just 1
met 1
him 1
Kelso 1
s 1
grandson 1
echoed 1
the 1
old 1
gentleman 1
Kelso 1
s 1
grandson 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
knew 1
his 1
mother 1
intimately 1
I 1
believe 1
I 1
was 1
at 1
her 1
christening 1
She 1
was 1
an 1
extraordinarily 1
beautiful 1
girl 1
Margaret 1
Devereux 1
and 1
made 1
all 1
the 1
men 1
frantic 1
by 1
running 1
away 1
with 1
a 1
penniless 1
young 1
fellow 1
a 1
mere 1
nobody 1
sir 1
a 1
subaltern 1
in 1
a 1
foot 1
regiment 1
or 1
something 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
Certainly 1
I 1
remember 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
happened 1
yesterday 1
The 1
poor 1
chap 1
was 1
killed 1
in 1
a 1
duel 1
at 1
Spa 1
a 1
few 1
months 1
after 1
the 1
marriage 1
There 1
was 1
an 1
ugly 1
story 1
about 1
it 1
They 1
said 1
Kelso 1
got 1
some 1
rascally 1
adventurer 1
some 1
Belgian 1
brute 1
to 1
insult 1
his 1
son 1
in 1
law 1
in 1
public 1
paid 1
him 1
sir 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
paid 1
him 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
fellow 1
spitted 1
his 1
man 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
pigeon 1
The 1
thing 1
was 1
hushed 1
up 1
but 1
egad 1
Kelso 1
ate 1
his 1
chop 1
alone 1
at 1
the 1
club 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
afterwards 1
He 1
brought 1
his 1
daughter 1
back 1
with 1
him 1
I 1
was 1
told 1
and 1
she 1
never 1
spoke 1
to 1
him 1
again 1
Oh 1
yes 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
bad 1
business 1
The 1
girl 1
died 1
too 1
died 1
within 1
a 1
year 1
So 1
she 1
left 1
a 1
son 1
did 1
she 1
I 1
had 1
forgotten 1
that 1
What 1
sort 1
of 1
boy 1
is 1
he 1
If 1
he 1
is 1
like 1
his 1
mother 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
good 1
looking 1
chap 1
He 1
is 1
very 1
good 1
looking 1
assented 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
I 1
hope 1
he 1
will 1
fall 1
into 1
proper 1
hands 1
continued 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
He 1
should 1
have 1
a 1
pot 1
of 1
money 1
waiting 1
for 1
him 1
if 1
Kelso 1
did 1
the 1
right 1
thing 1
by 1
him 1
His 1
mother 1
had 1
money 1
too 1
All 1
the 1
Selby 1
property 1
came 1
to 1
her 1
through 1
her 1
grandfather 1
Her 1
grandfather 1
hated 1
Kelso 1
thought 1
him 1
a 1
mean 1
dog 1
He 1
was 1
too 1
Came 1
to 1
Madrid 1
once 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
there 1
Egad 1
I 1
was 1
ashamed 1
of 1
him 1
The 1
Queen 1
used 1
to 1
ask 1
me 1
about 1
the 1
English 1
noble 1
who 1
was 1
always 1
quarrelling 1
with 1
the 1
cabmen 1
about 1
their 1
fares 1
They 1
made 1
quite 1
a 1
story 1
of 1
it 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
dare 1
show 1
my 1
face 1
at 1
Court 1
for 1
a 1
month 1
I 1
hope 1
he 1
treated 1
his 1
grandson 1
better 1
than 1
he 1
did 1
the 1
jarvies 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
answered 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
I 1
fancy 1
that 1
the 1
boy 1
will 1
be 1
well 1
off 1
He 1
is 1
not 1
of 1
age 1
yet 1
He 1
has 1
Selby 1
I 1
know 1
He 1
told 1
me 1
so 1
And 1
his 1
mother 1
was 1
very 1
beautiful 1
Margaret 1
Devereux 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
loveliest 1
creatures 1
I 1
ever 1
saw 1
Harry 1
What 1
on 1
earth 1
induced 1
her 1
to 1
behave 1
as 1
she 1
did 1
I 1
never 1
could 1
understand 1
She 1
could 1
have 1
married 1
anybody 1
she 1
chose 1
Carlington 1
was 1
mad 1
after 1
her 1
She 1
was 1
romantic 1
though 1
All 1
the 1
women 1
of 1
that 1
family 1
were 1
The 1
men 1
were 1
a 1
poor 1
lot 1
but 1
egad 1
the 1
women 1
were 1
wonderful 1
Carlington 1
went 1
on 1
his 1
knees 1
to 1
her 1
Told 1
me 1
so 1
himself 1
She 1
laughed 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
there 1
wasn 1
t 1
a 1
girl 1
in 1
London 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
who 1
wasn 1
t 1
after 1
him 1
And 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
Harry 1
talking 1
about 1
silly 1
marriages 1
what 1
is 1
this 1
humbug 1
your 1
father 1
tells 1
me 1
about 1
Dartmoor 1
wanting 1
to 1
marry 1
an 1
American 1
Ain 1
t 1
English 1
girls 1
good 1
enough 1
for 1
him 1
It 1
is 1
rather 1
fashionable 1
to 1
marry 1
Americans 1
just 1
now 1
Uncle 1
George 1
I 1
ll 1
back 1
English 1
women 1
against 1
the 1
world 1
Harry 1
said 1
Lord 1
Fermor 1
striking 1
the 1
table 1
with 1
his 1
fist 1
The 1
betting 1
is 1
on 1
the 1
Americans 1
They 1
don 1
t 1
last 1
I 1
am 1
told 1
muttered 1
his 1
uncle 1
A 1
long 1
engagement 1
exhausts 1
them 1
but 1
they 1
are 1
capital 1
at 1
a 1
steeplechase 1
They 1
take 1
things 1
flying 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
Dartmoor 1
has 1
a 1
chance 1
Who 1
are 1
her 1
people 1
grumbled 1
the 1
old 1
gentleman 1
Has 1
she 1
got 1
any 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
American 1
girls 1
are 1
as 1
clever 1
at 1
concealing 1
their 1
parents 1
as 1
English 1
women 1
are 1
at 1
concealing 1
their 1
past 1
he 1
said 1
rising 1
to 1
go 1
They 1
are 1
pork 1
packers 1
I 1
suppose 1
I 1
hope 1
so 1
Uncle 1
George 1
for 1
Dartmoor 1
s 1
sake 1
I 1
am 1
told 1
that 1
pork 1
packing 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
lucrative 1
profession 1
in 1
America 1
after 1
politics 1
Is 1
she 1
pretty 1
She 1
behaves 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
was 1
beautiful 1
Most 1
American 1
women 1
do 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
their 1
charm 1
Why 1
can 1
t 1
these 1
American 1
women 1
stay 1
in 1
their 1
own 1
country 1
They 1
are 1
always 1
telling 1
us 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
paradise 1
for 1
women 1
It 1
is 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
reason 1
why 1
like 1
Eve 1
they 1
are 1
so 1
excessively 1
anxious 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Good 1
bye 1
Uncle 1
George 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
late 1
for 1
lunch 1
if 1
I 1
stop 1
any 1
longer 1
Thanks 1
for 1
giving 1
me 1
the 1
information 1
I 1
wanted 1
I 1
always 1
like 1
to 1
know 1
everything 1
about 1
my 1
new 1
friends 1
and 1
nothing 1
about 1
my 1
old 1
ones 1
Where 1
are 1
you 1
lunching 1
Harry 1
At 1
Aunt 1
Agatha 1
s 1
I 1
have 1
asked 1
myself 1
and 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
He 1
is 1
her 1
latest 1
protege 1
Humph 1
tell 1
your 1
Aunt 1
Agatha 1
Harry 1
not 1
to 1
bother 1
me 1
any 1
more 1
with 1
her 1
charity 1
appeals 1
I 1
am 1
sick 1
of 1
them 1
Why 1
the 1
good 1
woman 1
thinks 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
to 1
write 1
cheques 1
for 1
her 1
silly 1
fads 1
All 1
right 1
Uncle 1
George 1
I 1
ll 1
tell 1
her 1
but 1
it 1
won 1
t 1
have 1
any 1
effect 1
Philanthropic 1
people 1
lose 1
all 1
sense 1
of 1
humanity 1
It 1
is 1
their 1
distinguishing 1
characteristic 1
The 1
old 1
gentleman 1
growled 1
approvingly 1
and 1
rang 1
the 1
bell 1
for 1
his 1
servant 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
passed 1
up 1
the 1
low 1
arcade 1
into 1
Burlington 1
Street 1
and 1
turned 1
his 1
steps 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
Berkeley 1
Square 1
So 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
s 1
parentage 1
Crudely 1
as 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
told 1
to 1
him 1
it 1
had 1
yet 1
stirred 1
him 1
by 1
its 1
suggestion 1
of 1
a 1
strange 1
almost 1
modern 1
romance 1
A 1
beautiful 1
woman 1
risking 1
everything 1
for 1
a 1
mad 1
passion 1
A 1
few 1
wild 1
weeks 1
of 1
happiness 1
cut 1
short 1
by 1
a 1
hideous 1
treacherous 1
crime 1
Months 1
of 1
voiceless 1
agony 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
child 1
born 1
in 1
pain 1
The 1
mother 1
snatched 1
away 1
by 1
death 1
the 1
boy 1
left 1
to 1
solitude 1
and 1
the 1
tyranny 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
and 1
loveless 1
man 1
Yes 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
interesting 1
background 1
It 1
posed 1
the 1
lad 1
made 1
him 1
more 1
perfect 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
Behind 1
every 1
exquisite 1
thing 1
that 1
existed 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
tragic 1
Worlds 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
travail 1
that 1
the 1
meanest 1
flower 1
might 1
blow 1
And 1
how 1
charming 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
at 1
dinner 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
as 1
with 1
startled 1
eyes 1
and 1
lips 1
parted 1
in 1
frightened 1
pleasure 1
he 1
had 1
sat 1
opposite 1
to 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
club 1
the 1
red 1
candleshades 1
staining 1
to 1
a 1
richer 1
rose 1
the 1
wakening 1
wonder 1
of 1
his 1
face 1
Talking 1
to 1
him 1
was 1
like 1
playing 1
upon 1
an 1
exquisite 1
violin 1
He 1
answered 1
to 1
every 1
touch 1
and 1
thrill 1
of 1
the 1
bow 1
There 1
was 1
something 1
terribly 1
enthralling 1
in 1
the 1
exercise 1
of 1
influence 1
No 1
other 1
activity 1
was 1
like 1
it 1
To 1
project 1
one 1
s 1
soul 1
into 1
some 1
gracious 1
form 1
and 1
let 1
it 1
tarry 1
there 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
to 1
hear 1
one 1
s 1
own 1
intellectual 1
views 1
echoed 1
back 1
to 1
one 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
added 1
music 1
of 1
passion 1
and 1
youth 1
to 1
convey 1
one 1
s 1
temperament 1
into 1
another 1
as 1
though 1
it 1
were 1
a 1
subtle 1
fluid 1
or 1
a 1
strange 1
perfume 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
real 1
joy 1
in 1
that 1
perhaps 1
the 1
most 1
satisfying 1
joy 1
left 1
to 1
us 1
in 1
an 1
age 1
so 1
limited 1
and 1
vulgar 1
as 1
our 1
own 1
an 1
age 1
grossly 1
carnal 1
in 1
its 1
pleasures 1
and 1
grossly 1
common 1
in 1
its 1
aims 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
marvellous 1
type 1
too 1
this 1
lad 1
whom 1
by 1
so 1
curious 1
a 1
chance 1
he 1
had 1
met 1
in 1
Basil 1
s 1
studio 1
or 1
could 1
be 1
fashioned 1
into 1
a 1
marvellous 1
type 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
Grace 1
was 1
his 1
and 1
the 1
white 1
purity 1
of 1
boyhood 1
and 1
beauty 1
such 1
as 1
old 1
Greek 1
marbles 1
kept 1
for 1
us 1
There 1
was 1
nothing 1
that 1
one 1
could 1
not 1
do 1
with 1
him 1
He 1
could 1
be 1
made 1
a 1
Titan 1
or 1
a 1
toy 1
What 1
a 1
pity 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
such 1
beauty 1
was 1
destined 1
to 1
fade 1
And 1
Basil 1
From 1
a 1
psychological 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
how 1
interesting 1
he 1
was 1
The 1
new 1
manner 1
in 1
art 1
the 1
fresh 1
mode 1
of 1
looking 1
at 1
life 1
suggested 1
so 1
strangely 1
by 1
the 1
merely 1
visible 1
presence 1
of 1
one 1
who 1
was 1
unconscious 1
of 1
it 1
all 1
the 1
silent 1
spirit 1
that 1
dwelt 1
in 1
dim 1
woodland 1
and 1
walked 1
unseen 1
in 1
open 1
field 1
suddenly 1
showing 1
herself 1
Dryadlike 1
and 1
not 1
afraid 1
because 1
in 1
his 1
soul 1
who 1
sought 1
for 1
her 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
wakened 1
that 1
wonderful 1
vision 1
to 1
which 1
alone 1
are 1
wonderful 1
things 1
revealed 1
the 1
mere 1
shapes 1
and 1
patterns 1
of 1
things 1
becoming 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
refined 1
and 1
gaining 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
symbolical 1
value 1
as 1
though 1
they 1
were 1
themselves 1
patterns 1
of 1
some 1
other 1
and 1
more 1
perfect 1
form 1
whose 1
shadow 1
they 1
made 1
real 1
how 1
strange 1
it 1
all 1
was 1
He 1
remembered 1
something 1
like 1
it 1
in 1
history 1
Was 1
it 1
not 1
Plato 1
that 1
artist 1
in 1
thought 1
who 1
had 1
first 1
analyzed 1
it 1
Was 1
it 1
not 1
Buonarotti 1
who 1
had 1
carved 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
coloured 1
marbles 1
of 1
a 1
sonnet 1
sequence 1
But 1
in 1
our 1
own 1
century 1
it 1
was 1
strange 1
Yes 1
he 1
would 1
try 1
to 1
be 1
to 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
what 1
without 1
knowing 1
it 1
the 1
lad 1
was 1
to 1
the 1
painter 1
who 1
had 1
fashioned 1
the 1
wonderful 1
portrait 1
He 1
would 1
seek 1
to 1
dominate 1
him 1
had 1
already 1
indeed 1
half 1
done 1
so 1
He 1
would 1
make 1
that 1
wonderful 1
spirit 1
his 1
own 1
There 1
was 1
something 1
fascinating 1
in 1
this 1
son 1
of 1
love 1
and 1
death 1
Suddenly 1
he 1
stopped 1
and 1
glanced 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
houses 1
He 1
found 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
passed 1
his 1
aunt 1
s 1
some 1
distance 1
and 1
smiling 1
to 1
himself 1
turned 1
back 1
When 1
he 1
entered 1
the 1
somewhat 1
sombre 1
hall 1
the 1
butler 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
gone 1
in 1
to 1
lunch 1
He 1
gave 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
footmen 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
stick 1
and 1
passed 1
into 1
the 1
dining 1
room 1
Late 1
as 1
usual 1
Harry 1
cried 1
his 1
aunt 1
shaking 1
her 1
head 1
at 1
him 1
He 1
invented 1
a 1
facile 1
excuse 1
and 1
having 1
taken 1
the 1
vacant 1
seat 1
next 1
to 1
her 1
looked 1
round 1
to 1
see 1
who 1
was 1
there 1
Dorian 1
bowed 1
to 1
him 1
shyly 1
from 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
table 1
a 1
flush 1
of 1
pleasure 1
stealing 1
into 1
his 1
cheek 1
Opposite 1
was 1
the 1
Duchess 1
of 1
Harley 1
a 1
lady 1
of 1
admirable 1
good 1
nature 1
and 1
good 1
temper 1
much 1
liked 1
by 1
every 1
one 1
who 1
knew 1
her 1
and 1
of 1
those 1
ample 1
architectural 1
proportions 1
that 1
in 1
women 1
who 1
are 1
not 1
duchesses 1
are 1
described 1
by 1
contemporary 1
historians 1
as 1
stoutness 1
Next 1
to 1
her 1
sat 1
on 1
her 1
right 1
Sir 1
Thomas 1
Burdon 1
a 1
Radical 1
member 1
of 1
Parliament 1
who 1
followed 1
his 1
leader 1
in 1
public 1
life 1
and 1
in 1
private 1
life 1
followed 1
the 1
best 1
cooks 1
dining 1
with 1
the 1
Tories 1
and 1
thinking 1
with 1
the 1
Liberals 1
in 1
accordance 1
with 1
a 1
wise 1
and 1
well 1
known 1
rule 1
The 1
post 1
on 1
her 1
left 1
was 1
occupied 1
by 1
Mr 1
Erskine 1
of 1
Treadley 1
an 1
old 1
gentleman 1
of 1
considerable 1
charm 1
and 1
culture 1
who 1
had 1
fallen 1
however 1
into 1
bad 1
habits 1
of 1
silence 1
having 1
as 1
he 1
explained 1
once 1
to 1
Lady 1
Agatha 1
said 1
everything 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
say 1
before 1
he 1
was 1
thirty 1
His 1
own 1
neighbour 1
was 1
Mrs 1
Vandeleur 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
aunt 1
s 1
oldest 1
friends 1
a 1
perfect 1
saint 1
amongst 1
women 1
but 1
so 1
dreadfully 1
dowdy 1
that 1
she 1
reminded 1
one 1
of 1
a 1
badly 1
bound 1
hymn 1
book 1
Fortunately 1
for 1
him 1
she 1
had 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
Lord 1
Faudel 1
a 1
most 1
intelligent 1
middle 1
aged 1
mediocrity 1
as 1
bald 1
as 1
a 1
ministerial 1
statement 1
in 1
the 1
House 1
of 1
Commons 1
with 1
whom 1
she 1
was 1
conversing 1
in 1
that 1
intensely 1
earnest 1
manner 1
which 1
is 1
the 1
one 1
unpardonable 1
error 1
as 1
he 1
remarked 1
once 1
himself 1
that 1
all 1
really 1
good 1
people 1
fall 1
into 1
and 1
from 1
which 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
ever 1
quite 1
escape 1
We 1
are 1
talking 1
about 1
poor 1
Dartmoor 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
cried 1
the 1
duchess 1
nodding 1
pleasantly 1
to 1
him 1
across 1
the 1
table 1
Do 1
you 1
think 1
he 1
will 1
really 1
marry 1
this 1
fascinating 1
young 1
person 1
I 1
believe 1
she 1
has 1
made 1
up 1
her 1
mind 1
to 1
propose 1
to 1
him 1
Duchess 1
How 1
dreadful 1
exclaimed 1
Lady 1
Agatha 1
Really 1
some 1
one 1
should 1
interfere 1
I 1
am 1
told 1
on 1
excellent 1
authority 1
that 1
her 1
father 1
keeps 1
an 1
American 1
dry 1
goods 1
store 1
said 1
Sir 1
Thomas 1
Burdon 1
looking 1
supercilious 1
My 1
uncle 1
has 1
already 1
suggested 1
pork 1
packing 1
Sir 1
Thomas 1
Dry 1
goods 1
What 1
are 1
American 1
dry 1
goods 1
asked 1
the 1
duchess 1
raising 1
her 1
large 1
hands 1
in 1
wonder 1
and 1
accentuating 1
the 1
verb 1
American 1
novels 1
answered 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
helping 1
himself 1
to 1
some 1
quail 1
The 1
duchess 1
looked 1
puzzled 1
Don 1
t 1
mind 1
him 1
my 1
dear 1
whispered 1
Lady 1
Agatha 1
He 1
never 1
means 1
anything 1
that 1
he 1
says 1
When 1
America 1
was 1
discovered 1
said 1
the 1
Radical 1
member 1
and 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
give 1
some 1
wearisome 1
facts 1
Like 1
all 1
people 1
who 1
try 1
to 1
exhaust 1
a 1
subject 1
he 1
exhausted 1
his 1
listeners 1
The 1
duchess 1
sighed 1
and 1
exercised 1
her 1
privilege 1
of 1
interruption 1
I 1
wish 1
to 1
goodness 1
it 1
never 1
had 1
been 1
discovered 1
at 1
all 1
she 1
exclaimed 1
Really 1
our 1
girls 1
have 1
no 1
chance 1
nowadays 1
It 1
is 1
most 1
unfair 1
Perhaps 1
after 1
all 1
America 1
never 1
has 1
been 1
discovered 1
said 1
Mr 1
Erskine 1
I 1
myself 1
would 1
say 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
merely 1
been 1
detected 1
Oh 1
but 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
specimens 1
of 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
answered 1
the 1
duchess 1
vaguely 1
I 1
must 1
confess 1
that 1
most 1
of 1
them 1
are 1
extremely 1
pretty 1
And 1
they 1
dress 1
well 1
too 1
They 1
get 1
all 1
their 1
dresses 1
in 1
Paris 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
could 1
afford 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
same 1
They 1
say 1
that 1
when 1
good 1
Americans 1
die 1
they 1
go 1
to 1
Paris 1
chuckled 1
Sir 1
Thomas 1
who 1
had 1
a 1
large 1
wardrobe 1
of 1
Humour 1
s 1
cast 1
off 1
clothes 1
Really 1
And 1
where 1
do 1
bad 1
Americans 1
go 1
to 1
when 1
they 1
die 1
inquired 1
the 1
duchess 1
They 1
go 1
to 1
America 1
murmured 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Sir 1
Thomas 1
frowned 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
your 1
nephew 1
is 1
prejudiced 1
against 1
that 1
great 1
country 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
Lady 1
Agatha 1
I 1
have 1
travelled 1
all 1
over 1
it 1
in 1
cars 1
provided 1
by 1
the 1
directors 1
who 1
in 1
such 1
matters 1
are 1
extremely 1
civil 1
I 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
an 1
education 1
to 1
visit 1
it 1
But 1
must 1
we 1
really 1
see 1
Chicago 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
be 1
educated 1
asked 1
Mr 1
Erskine 1
plaintively 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
feel 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
journey 1
Sir 1
Thomas 1
waved 1
his 1
hand 1
Mr 1
Erskine 1
of 1
Treadley 1
has 1
the 1
world 1
on 1
his 1
shelves 1
We 1
practical 1
men 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
things 1
not 1
to 1
read 1
about 1
them 1
The 1
Americans 1
are 1
an 1
extremely 1
interesting 1
people 1
They 1
are 1
absolutely 1
reasonable 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
is 1
their 1
distinguishing 1
characteristic 1
Yes 1
Mr 1
Erskine 1
an 1
absolutely 1
reasonable 1
people 1
I 1
assure 1
you 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
nonsense 1
about 1
the 1
Americans 1
How 1
dreadful 1
cried 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
I 1
can 1
stand 1
brute 1
force 1
but 1
brute 1
reason 1
is 1
quite 1
unbearable 1
There 1
is 1
something 1
unfair 1
about 1
its 1
use 1
It 1
is 1
hitting 1
below 1
the 1
intellect 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
understand 1
you 1
said 1
Sir 1
Thomas 1
growing 1
rather 1
red 1
I 1
do 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
murmured 1
Mr 1
Erskine 1
with 1
a 1
smile 1
Paradoxes 1
are 1
all 1
very 1
well 1
in 1
their 1
way 1
rejoined 1
the 1
baronet 1
Was 1
that 1
a 1
paradox 1
asked 1
Mr 1
Erskine 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
think 1
so 1
Perhaps 1
it 1
was 1
Well 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
paradoxes 1
is 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
truth 1
To 1
test 1
reality 1
we 1
must 1
see 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
tight 1
rope 1
When 1
the 1
verities 1
become 1
acrobats 1
we 1
can 1
judge 1
them 1
Dear 1
me 1
said 1
Lady 1
Agatha 1
how 1
you 1
men 1
argue 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
I 1
never 1
can 1
make 1
out 1
what 1
you 1
are 1
talking 1
about 1
Oh 1
Harry 1
I 1
am 1
quite 1
vexed 1
with 1
you 1
Why 1
do 1
you 1
try 1
to 1
persuade 1
our 1
nice 1
Mr 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
to 1
give 1
up 1
the 1
East 1
End 1
I 1
assure 1
you 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
quite 1
invaluable 1
They 1
would 1
love 1
his 1
playing 1
I 1
want 1
him 1
to 1
play 1
to 1
me 1
cried 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
smiling 1
and 1
he 1
looked 1
down 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
caught 1
a 1
bright 1
answering 1
glance 1
But 1
they 1
are 1
so 1
unhappy 1
in 1
Whitechapel 1
continued 1
Lady 1
Agatha 1
I 1
can 1
sympathize 1
with 1
everything 1
except 1
suffering 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
shrugging 1
his 1
shoulders 1
I 1
cannot 1
sympathize 1
with 1
that 1
It 1
is 1
too 1
ugly 1
too 1
horrible 1
too 1
distressing 1
There 1
is 1
something 1
terribly 1
morbid 1
in 1
the 1
modern 1
sympathy 1
with 1
pain 1
One 1
should 1
sympathize 1
with 1
the 1
colour 1
the 1
beauty 1
the 1
joy 1
of 1
life 1
The 1
less 1
said 1
about 1
life 1
s 1
sores 1
the 1
better 1
Still 1
the 1
East 1
End 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
important 1
problem 1
remarked 1
Sir 1
Thomas 1
with 1
a 1
grave 1
shake 1
of 1
the 1
head 1
Quite 1
so 1
answered 1
the 1
young 1
lord 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
problem 1
of 1
slavery 1
and 1
we 1
try 1
to 1
solve 1
it 1
by 1
amusing 1
the 1
slaves 1
The 1
politician 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
keenly 1
What 1
change 1
do 1
you 1
propose 1
then 1
he 1
asked 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
laughed 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
desire 1
to 1
change 1
anything 1
in 1
England 1
except 1
the 1
weather 1
he 1
answered 1
I 1
am 1
quite 1
content 1
with 1
philosophic 1
contemplation 1
But 1
as 1
the 1
nineteenth 1
century 1
has 1
gone 1
bankrupt 1
through 1
an 1
over 1
expenditure 1
of 1
sympathy 1
I 1
would 1
suggest 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
appeal 1
to 1
science 1
to 1
put 1
us 1
straight 1
The 1
advantage 1
of 1
the 1
emotions 1
is 1
that 1
they 1
lead 1
us 1
astray 1
and 1
the 1
advantage 1
of 1
science 1
is 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
emotional 1
But 1
we 1
have 1
such 1
grave 1
responsibilities 1
ventured 1
Mrs 1
Vandeleur 1
timidly 1
Terribly 1
grave 1
echoed 1
Lady 1
Agatha 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
looked 1
over 1
at 1
Mr 1
Erskine 1
Humanity 1
takes 1
itself 1
too 1
seriously 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
world 1
s 1
original 1
sin 1
If 1
the 1
caveman 1
had 1
known 1
how 1
to 1
laugh 1
history 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
different 1
You 1
are 1
really 1
very 1
comforting 1
warbled 1
the 1
duchess 1
I 1
have 1
always 1
felt 1
rather 1
guilty 1
when 1
I 1
came 1
to 1
see 1
your 1
dear 1
aunt 1
for 1
I 1
take 1
no 1
interest 1
at 1
all 1
in 1
the 1
East 1
End 1
For 1
the 1
future 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
look 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
without 1
a 1
blush 1
A 1
blush 1
is 1
very 1
becoming 1
Duchess 1
remarked 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Only 1
when 1
one 1
is 1
young 1
she 1
answered 1
When 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
like 1
myself 1
blushes 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
bad 1
sign 1
Ah 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
I 1
wish 1
you 1
would 1
tell 1
me 1
how 1
to 1
become 1
young 1
again 1
He 1
thought 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
Can 1
you 1
remember 1
any 1
great 1
error 1
that 1
you 1
committed 1
in 1
your 1
early 1
days 1
Duchess 1
he 1
asked 1
looking 1
at 1
her 1
across 1
the 1
table 1
A 1
great 1
many 1
I 1
fear 1
she 1
cried 1
Then 1
commit 1
them 1
over 1
again 1
he 1
said 1
gravely 1
To 1
get 1
back 1
one 1
s 1
youth 1
one 1
has 1
merely 1
to 1
repeat 1
one 1
s 1
follies 1
A 1
delightful 1
theory 1
she 1
exclaimed 1
I 1
must 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
practice 1
A 1
dangerous 1
theory 1
came 1
from 1
Sir 1
Thomas 1
s 1
tight 1
lips 1
Lady 1
Agatha 1
shook 1
her 1
head 1
but 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
being 1
amused 1
Mr 1
Erskine 1
listened 1
Yes 1
he 1
continued 1
that 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
secrets 1
of 1
life 1
Nowadays 1
most 1
people 1
die 1
of 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
creeping 1
common 1
sense 1
and 1
discover 1
when 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
late 1
that 1
the 1
only 1
things 1
one 1
never 1
regrets 1
are 1
one 1
s 1
mistakes 1
A 1
laugh 1
ran 1
round 1
the 1
table 1
He 1
played 1
with 1
the 1
idea 1
and 1
grew 1
wilful 1
tossed 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
transformed 1
it 1
let 1
it 1
escape 1
and 1
recaptured 1
it 1
made 1
it 1
iridescent 1
with 1
fancy 1
and 1
winged 1
it 1
with 1
paradox 1
The 1
praise 1
of 1
folly 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
on 1
soared 1
into 1
a 1
philosophy 1
and 1
philosophy 1
herself 1
became 1
young 1
and 1
catching 1
the 1
mad 1
music 1
of 1
pleasure 1
wearing 1
one 1
might 1
fancy 1
her 1
wine 1
stained 1
robe 1
and 1
wreath 1
of 1
ivy 1
danced 1
like 1
a 1
Bacchante 1
over 1
the 1
hills 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
mocked 1
the 1
slow 1
Silenus 1
for 1
being 1
sober 1
Facts 1
fled 1
before 1
her 1
like 1
frightened 1
forest 1
things 1
Her 1
white 1
feet 1
trod 1
the 1
huge 1
press 1
at 1
which 1
wise 1
Omar 1
sits 1
till 1
the 1
seething 1
grape 1
juice 1
rose 1
round 1
her 1
bare 1
limbs 1
in 1
waves 1
of 1
purple 1
bubbles 1
or 1
crawled 1
in 1
red 1
foam 1
over 1
the 1
vat 1
s 1
black 1
dripping 1
sloping 1
sides 1
It 1
was 1
an 1
extraordinary 1
improvisation 1
He 1
felt 1
that 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
were 1
fixed 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
consciousness 1
that 1
amongst 1
his 1
audience 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
whose 1
temperament 1
he 1
wished 1
to 1
fascinate 1
seemed 1
to 1
give 1
his 1
wit 1
keenness 1
and 1
to 1
lend 1
colour 1
to 1
his 1
imagination 1
He 1
was 1
brilliant 1
fantastic 1
irresponsible 1
He 1
charmed 1
his 1
listeners 1
out 1
of 1
themselves 1
and 1
they 1
followed 1
his 1
pipe 1
laughing 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
never 1
took 1
his 1
gaze 1
off 1
him 1
but 1
sat 1
like 1
one 1
under 1
a 1
spell 1
smiles 1
chasing 1
each 1
other 1
over 1
his 1
lips 1
and 1
wonder 1
growing 1
grave 1
in 1
his 1
darkening 1
eyes 1
At 1
last 1
liveried 1
in 1
the 1
costume 1
of 1
the 1
age 1
reality 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
a 1
servant 1
to 1
tell 1
the 1
duchess 1
that 1
her 1
carriage 1
was 1
waiting 1
She 1
wrung 1
her 1
hands 1
in 1
mock 1
despair 1
How 1
annoying 1
she 1
cried 1
I 1
must 1
go 1
I 1
have 1
to 1
call 1
for 1
my 1
husband 1
at 1
the 1
club 1
to 1
take 1
him 1
to 1
some 1
absurd 1
meeting 1
at 1
Willis 1
s 1
Rooms 1
where 1
he 1
is 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
chair 1
If 1
I 1
am 1
late 1
he 1
is 1
sure 1
to 1
be 1
furious 1
and 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
have 1
a 1
scene 1
in 1
this 1
bonnet 1
It 1
is 1
far 1
too 1
fragile 1
A 1
harsh 1
word 1
would 1
ruin 1
it 1
No 1
I 1
must 1
go 1
dear 1
Agatha 1
Good 1
bye 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
you 1
are 1
quite 1
delightful 1
and 1
dreadfully 1
demoralizing 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
about 1
your 1
views 1
You 1
must 1
come 1
and 1
dine 1
with 1
us 1
some 1
night 1
Tuesday 1
Are 1
you 1
disengaged 1
Tuesday 1
For 1
you 1
I 1
would 1
throw 1
over 1
anybody 1
Duchess 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
with 1
a 1
bow 1
Ah 1
that 1
is 1
very 1
nice 1
and 1
very 1
wrong 1
of 1
you 1
she 1
cried 1
so 1
mind 1
you 1
come 1
and 1
she 1
swept 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
followed 1
by 1
Lady 1
Agatha 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
ladies 1
When 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
had 1
sat 1
down 1
again 1
Mr 1
Erskine 1
moved 1
round 1
and 1
taking 1
a 1
chair 1
close 1
to 1
him 1
placed 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
his 1
arm 1
You 1
talk 1
books 1
away 1
he 1
said 1
why 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
write 1
one 1
I 1
am 1
too 1
fond 1
of 1
reading 1
books 1
to 1
care 1
to 1
write 1
them 1
Mr 1
Erskine 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
write 1
a 1
novel 1
certainly 1
a 1
novel 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
as 1
lovely 1
as 1
a 1
Persian 1
carpet 1
and 1
as 1
unreal 1
But 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
literary 1
public 1
in 1
England 1
for 1
anything 1
except 1
newspapers 1
primers 1
and 1
encyclopaedias 1
Of 1
all 1
people 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
the 1
English 1
have 1
the 1
least 1
sense 1
of 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
literature 1
I 1
fear 1
you 1
are 1
right 1
answered 1
Mr 1
Erskine 1
I 1
myself 1
used 1
to 1
have 1
literary 1
ambitions 1
but 1
I 1
gave 1
them 1
up 1
long 1
ago 1
And 1
now 1
my 1
dear 1
young 1
friend 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
call 1
you 1
so 1
may 1
I 1
ask 1
if 1
you 1
really 1
meant 1
all 1
that 1
you 1
said 1
to 1
us 1
at 1
lunch 1
I 1
quite 1
forget 1
what 1
I 1
said 1
smiled 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Was 1
it 1
all 1
very 1
bad 1
Very 1
bad 1
indeed 1
In 1
fact 1
I 1
consider 1
you 1
extremely 1
dangerous 1
and 1
if 1
anything 1
happens 1
to 1
our 1
good 1
duchess 1
we 1
shall 1
all 1
look 1
on 1
you 1
as 1
being 1
primarily 1
responsible 1
But 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
you 1
about 1
life 1
The 1
generation 1
into 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
born 1
was 1
tedious 1
Some 1
day 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
tired 1
of 1
London 1
come 1
down 1
to 1
Treadley 1
and 1
expound 1
to 1
me 1
your 1
philosophy 1
of 1
pleasure 1
over 1
some 1
admirable 1
Burgundy 1
I 1
am 1
fortunate 1
enough 1
to 1
possess 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
charmed 1
A 1
visit 1
to 1
Treadley 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
great 1
privilege 1
It 1
has 1
a 1
perfect 1
host 1
and 1
a 1
perfect 1
library 1
You 1
will 1
complete 1
it 1
answered 1
the 1
old 1
gentleman 1
with 1
a 1
courteous 1
bow 1
And 1
now 1
I 1
must 1
bid 1
good 1
bye 1
to 1
your 1
excellent 1
aunt 1
I 1
am 1
due 1
at 1
the 1
Athenaeum 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
hour 1
when 1
we 1
sleep 1
there 1
All 1
of 1
you 1
Mr 1
Erskine 1
Forty 1
of 1
us 1
in 1
forty 1
arm 1
chairs 1
We 1
are 1
practising 1
for 1
an 1
English 1
Academy 1
of 1
Letters 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
laughed 1
and 1
rose 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
park 1
he 1
cried 1
As 1
he 1
was 1
passing 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
touched 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
arm 1
Let 1
me 1
come 1
with 1
you 1
he 1
murmured 1
But 1
I 1
thought 1
you 1
had 1
promised 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
see 1
him 1
answered 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
I 1
would 1
sooner 1
come 1
with 1
you 1
yes 1
I 1
feel 1
I 1
must 1
come 1
with 1
you 1
Do 1
let 1
me 1
And 1
you 1
will 1
promise 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
me 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
No 1
one 1
talks 1
so 1
wonderfully 1
as 1
you 1
do 1
Ah 1
I 1
have 1
talked 1
quite 1
enough 1
for 1
to 1
day 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
smiling 1
All 1
I 1
want 1
now 1
is 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
life 1
You 1
may 1
come 1
and 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
with 1
me 1
if 1
you 1
care 1
to 1
CHAPTER 1
One 1
afternoon 1
a 1
month 1
later 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
was 1
reclining 1
in 1
a 1
luxurious 1
arm 1
chair 1
in 1
the 1
little 1
library 1
of 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
s 1
house 1
in 1
Mayfair 1
It 1
was 1
in 1
its 1
way 1
a 1
very 1
charming 1
room 1
with 1
its 1
high 1
panelled 1
wainscoting 1
of 1
olive 1
stained 1
oak 1
its 1
cream 1
coloured 1
frieze 1
and 1
ceiling 1
of 1
raised 1
plasterwork 1
and 1
its 1
brickdust 1
felt 1
carpet 1
strewn 1
with 1
silk 1
long 1
fringed 1
Persian 1
rugs 1
On 1
a 1
tiny 1
satinwood 1
table 1
stood 1
a 1
statuette 1
by 1
Clodion 1
and 1
beside 1
it 1
lay 1
a 1
copy 1
of 1
Les 1
Cent 1
Nouvelles 1
bound 1
for 1
Margaret 1
of 1
Valois 1
by 1
Clovis 1
Eve 1
and 1
powdered 1
with 1
the 1
gilt 1
daisies 1
that 1
Queen 1
had 1
selected 1
for 1
her 1
device 1
Some 1
large 1
blue 1
china 1
jars 1
and 1
parrot 1
tulips 1
were 1
ranged 1
on 1
the 1
mantelshelf 1
and 1
through 1
the 1
small 1
leaded 1
panes 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
streamed 1
the 1
apricot 1
coloured 1
light 1
of 1
a 1
summer 1
day 1
in 1
London 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
come 1
in 1
He 1
was 1
always 1
late 1
on 1
principle 1
his 1
principle 1
being 1
that 1
punctuality 1
is 1
the 1
thief 1
of 1
time 1
So 1
the 1
lad 1
was 1
looking 1
rather 1
sulky 1
as 1
with 1
listless 1
fingers 1
he 1
turned 1
over 1
the 1
pages 1
of 1
an 1
elaborately 1
illustrated 1
edition 1
of 1
Manon 1
Lescaut 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
found 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
book 1
cases 1
The 1
formal 1
monotonous 1
ticking 1
of 1
the 1
Louis 1
Quatorze 1
clock 1
annoyed 1
him 1
Once 1
or 1
twice 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
going 1
away 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
step 1
outside 1
and 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
How 1
late 1
you 1
are 1
Harry 1
he 1
murmured 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
Harry 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
answered 1
a 1
shrill 1
voice 1
He 1
glanced 1
quickly 1
round 1
and 1
rose 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
I 1
beg 1
your 1
pardon 1
I 1
thought 1
You 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
my 1
husband 1
It 1
is 1
only 1
his 1
wife 1
You 1
must 1
let 1
me 1
introduce 1
myself 1
I 1
know 1
you 1
quite 1
well 1
by 1
your 1
photographs 1
I 1
think 1
my 1
husband 1
has 1
got 1
seventeen 1
of 1
them 1
Not 1
seventeen 1
Lady 1
Henry 1
Well 1
eighteen 1
then 1
And 1
I 1
saw 1
you 1
with 1
him 1
the 1
other 1
night 1
at 1
the 1
opera 1
She 1
laughed 1
nervously 1
as 1
she 1
spoke 1
and 1
watched 1
him 1
with 1
her 1
vague 1
forget 1
me 1
not 1
eyes 1
She 1
was 1
a 1
curious 1
woman 1
whose 1
dresses 1
always 1
looked 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
designed 1
in 1
a 1
rage 1
and 1
put 1
on 1
in 1
a 1
tempest 1
She 1
was 1
usually 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
somebody 1
and 1
as 1
her 1
passion 1
was 1
never 1
returned 1
she 1
had 1
kept 1
all 1
her 1
illusions 1
She 1
tried 1
to 1
look 1
picturesque 1
but 1
only 1
succeeded 1
in 1
being 1
untidy 1
Her 1
name 1
was 1
Victoria 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
perfect 1
mania 1
for 1
going 1
to 1
church 1
That 1
was 1
at 1
Lohengrin 1
Lady 1
Henry 1
I 1
think 1
Yes 1
it 1
was 1
at 1
dear 1
Lohengrin 1
I 1
like 1
Wagner 1
s 1
music 1
better 1
than 1
anybody 1
s 1
It 1
is 1
so 1
loud 1
that 1
one 1
can 1
talk 1
the 1
whole 1
time 1
without 1
other 1
people 1
hearing 1
what 1
one 1
says 1
That 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
advantage 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
think 1
so 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
The 1
same 1
nervous 1
staccato 1
laugh 1
broke 1
from 1
her 1
thin 1
lips 1
and 1
her 1
fingers 1
began 1
to 1
play 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
tortoise 1
shell 1
paper 1
knife 1
Dorian 1
smiled 1
and 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
so 1
Lady 1
Henry 1
I 1
never 1
talk 1
during 1
music 1
at 1
least 1
during 1
good 1
music 1
If 1
one 1
hears 1
bad 1
music 1
it 1
is 1
one 1
s 1
duty 1
to 1
drown 1
it 1
in 1
conversation 1
Ah 1
that 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
Harry 1
s 1
views 1
isn 1
t 1
it 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
I 1
always 1
hear 1
Harry 1
s 1
views 1
from 1
his 1
friends 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
way 1
I 1
get 1
to 1
know 1
of 1
them 1
But 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
think 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
good 1
music 1
I 1
adore 1
it 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
of 1
it 1
It 1
makes 1
me 1
too 1
romantic 1
I 1
have 1
simply 1
worshipped 1
pianists 1
two 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
sometimes 1
Harry 1
tells 1
me 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
about 1
them 1
Perhaps 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
foreigners 1
They 1
all 1
are 1
ain 1
t 1
they 1
Even 1
those 1
that 1
are 1
born 1
in 1
England 1
become 1
foreigners 1
after 1
a 1
time 1
don 1
t 1
they 1
It 1
is 1
so 1
clever 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
such 1
a 1
compliment 1
to 1
art 1
Makes 1
it 1
quite 1
cosmopolitan 1
doesn 1
t 1
it 1
You 1
have 1
never 1
been 1
to 1
any 1
of 1
my 1
parties 1
have 1
you 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
You 1
must 1
come 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
afford 1
orchids 1
but 1
I 1
spare 1
no 1
expense 1
in 1
foreigners 1
They 1
make 1
one 1
s 1
rooms 1
look 1
so 1
picturesque 1
But 1
here 1
is 1
Harry 2
I 1
came 1
in 1
to 1
look 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
something 1
I 1
forget 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
and 1
I 1
found 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
here 1
We 1
have 1
had 1
such 1
a 1
pleasant 1
chat 1
about 1
music 1
We 1
have 1
quite 1
the 1
same 1
ideas 1
No 1
I 1
think 1
our 1
ideas 1
are 1
quite 1
different 1
But 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
most 1
pleasant 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
glad 1
I 1
ve 1
seen 1
him 1
I 1
am 1
charmed 1
my 1
love 1
quite 1
charmed 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
elevating 1
his 1
dark 1
crescent 1
shaped 1
eyebrows 1
and 1
looking 1
at 1
them 1
both 1
with 1
an 1
amused 1
smile 1
So 1
sorry 1
I 1
am 1
late 1
Dorian 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
look 1
after 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
old 1
brocade 1
in 1
Wardour 1
Street 1
and 1
had 1
to 1
bargain 1
for 1
hours 1
for 1
it 1
Nowadays 1
people 1
know 1
the 1
price 1
of 1
everything 1
and 1
the 1
value 1
of 1
nothing 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
I 1
must 1
be 1
going 1
exclaimed 1
Lady 1
Henry 1
breaking 1
an 1
awkward 1
silence 1
with 1
her 1
silly 1
sudden 1
laugh 1
I 1
have 1
promised 1
to 1
drive 1
with 1
the 1
duchess 1
Good 1
bye 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
Good 1
bye 1
Harry 1
You 1
are 1
dining 1
out 1
I 1
suppose 1
So 1
am 1
I 1
Perhaps 1
I 1
shall 1
see 1
you 1
at 1
Lady 1
Thornbury 1
s 1
I 1
dare 1
say 1
my 1
dear 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
shutting 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
her 1
as 1
looking 1
like 1
a 1
bird 1
of 1
paradise 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
out 1
all 1
night 1
in 1
the 1
rain 1
she 1
flitted 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
leaving 1
a 1
faint 1
odour 1
of 1
frangipanni 1
Then 1
he 1
lit 1
a 1
cigarette 1
and 1
flung 1
himself 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
sofa 1
Never 1
marry 1
a 1
woman 1
with 1
straw 1
coloured 1
hair 1
Dorian 1
he 1
said 1
after 1
a 1
few 1
puffs 1
Why 1
Harry 1
Because 1
they 1
are 1
so 1
sentimental 1
But 1
I 1
like 1
sentimental 1
people 1
Never 1
marry 1
at 1
all 1
Dorian 1
Men 1
marry 1
because 1
they 1
are 1
tired 1
women 1
because 1
they 1
are 1
curious 1
both 1
are 1
disappointed 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
I 1
am 1
likely 1
to 1
marry 1
Harry 1
I 1
am 1
too 1
much 1
in 1
love 1
That 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
your 1
aphorisms 1
I 1
am 1
putting 1
it 1
into 1
practice 1
as 1
I 1
do 1
everything 1
that 1
you 1
say 1
Who 1
are 1
you 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
asked 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
after 1
a 1
pause 1
With 1
an 1
actress 1
said 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
blushing 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
That 1
is 1
a 1
rather 1
commonplace 1
debut 1
You 1
would 1
not 1
say 1
so 1
if 1
you 1
saw 1
her 1
Harry 1
Who 1
is 1
she 1
Her 1
name 1
is 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
Never 1
heard 1
of 1
her 1
No 1
one 1
has 1
People 1
will 1
some 1
day 1
however 1
She 1
is 1
a 1
genius 1
My 1
dear 1
boy 1
no 1
woman 1
is 1
a 1
genius 1
Women 1
are 1
a 1
decorative 1
sex 1
They 1
never 1
have 1
anything 1
to 1
say 1
but 1
they 1
say 1
it 1
charmingly 1
Women 1
represent 1
the 1
triumph 1
of 1
matter 1
over 1
mind 1
just 1
as 1
men 1
represent 1
the 1
triumph 1
of 1
mind 1
over 1
morals 1
Harry 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
My 1
dear 1
Dorian 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
true 1
I 1
am 1
analysing 1
women 1
at 1
present 1
so 1
I 1
ought 1
to 1
know 1
The 1
subject 1
is 1
not 1
so 1
abstruse 1
as 1
I 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
I 1
find 1
that 1
ultimately 1
there 1
are 1
only 1
two 1
kinds 1
of 1
women 1
the 1
plain 1
and 1
the 1
coloured 1
The 1
plain 1
women 1
are 1
very 1
useful 1
If 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
gain 1
a 1
reputation 1
for 1
respectability 1
you 1
have 1
merely 1
to 1
take 1
them 1
down 1
to 1
supper 1
The 1
other 1
women 1
are 1
very 1
charming 1
They 1
commit 1
one 1
mistake 1
however 1
They 1
paint 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
look 1
young 1
Our 1
grandmothers 1
painted 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
talk 1
brilliantly 1
Rouge 1
and 1
esprit 1
used 1
to 1
go 1
together 1
That 1
is 1
all 1
over 1
now 1
As 1
long 1
as 1
a 1
woman 1
can 1
look 1
ten 1
years 1
younger 1
than 1
her 1
own 1
daughter 1
she 1
is 1
perfectly 1
satisfied 1
As 1
for 1
conversation 1
there 1
are 1
only 1
five 1
women 1
in 1
London 1
worth 1
talking 1
to 1
and 1
two 1
of 1
these 1
can 1
t 1
be 1
admitted 1
into 1
decent 1
society 1
However 1
tell 1
me 1
about 1
your 1
genius 1
How 1
long 1
have 1
you 1
known 1
her 1
Ah 1
Harry 1
your 1
views 1
terrify 1
me 1
Never 1
mind 1
that 1
How 1
long 1
have 1
you 1
known 1
her 1
About 1
three 1
weeks 1
And 1
where 1
did 1
you 1
come 1
across 1
her 1
I 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
Harry 1
but 1
you 1
mustn 1
t 1
be 1
unsympathetic 1
about 1
it 1
After 1
all 1
it 1
never 1
would 1
have 1
happened 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
met 1
you 1
You 1
filled 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
wild 1
desire 1
to 1
know 1
everything 1
about 1
life 1
For 1
days 1
after 1
I 1
met 1
you 1
something 1
seemed 1
to 1
throb 1
in 1
my 1
veins 1
As 1
I 1
lounged 1
in 1
the 1
park 1
or 1
strolled 1
down 1
Piccadilly 1
I 1
used 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
every 1
one 1
who 1
passed 1
me 1
and 1
wonder 1
with 1
a 1
mad 1
curiosity 1
what 1
sort 1
of 1
lives 1
they 1
led 1
Some 1
of 1
them 1
fascinated 1
me 1
Others 1
filled 1
me 1
with 1
terror 1
There 1
was 1
an 1
exquisite 1
poison 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
passion 1
for 1
sensations 1
Well 1
one 1
evening 1
about 1
seven 1
o 1
clock 1
I 1
determined 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
some 1
adventure 1
I 1
felt 1
that 1
this 1
grey 1
monstrous 1
London 1
of 1
ours 1
with 1
its 1
myriads 1
of 1
people 1
its 1
sordid 1
sinners 1
and 1
its 1
splendid 1
sins 1
as 1
you 1
once 1
phrased 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
something 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
me 1
I 1
fancied 1
a 1
thousand 1
things 1
The 1
mere 1
danger 1
gave 1
me 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
delight 1
I 1
remembered 1
what 1
you 1
had 1
said 1
to 1
me 1
on 1
that 1
wonderful 1
evening 1
when 1
we 1
first 1
dined 1
together 1
about 1
the 1
search 1
for 1
beauty 1
being 1
the 1
real 1
secret 1
of 1
life 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
expected 1
but 1
I 1
went 1
out 1
and 1
wandered 1
eastward 1
soon 1
losing 1
my 1
way 1
in 1
a 1
labyrinth 1
of 1
grimy 1
streets 1
and 1
black 1
grassless 1
squares 1
About 1
half 1
past 1
eight 1
I 1
passed 1
by 1
an 1
absurd 1
little 1
theatre 1
with 1
great 1
flaring 1
gas 1
jets 1
and 1
gaudy 1
play 1
bills 1
A 1
hideous 1
Jew 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
amazing 1
waistcoat 1
I 1
ever 1
beheld 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
was 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
entrance 1
smoking 1
a 1
vile 1
cigar 1
He 1
had 1
greasy 1
ringlets 1
and 1
an 1
enormous 1
diamond 1
blazed 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
a 1
soiled 1
shirt 1
Have 1
a 1
box 1
my 1
Lord 1
he 1
said 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
me 1
and 1
he 1
took 1
off 1
his 1
hat 1
with 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
gorgeous 1
servility 1
There 1
was 1
something 1
about 1
him 1
Harry 1
that 1
amused 1
me 1
He 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
monster 1
You 1
will 1
laugh 1
at 1
me 1
I 1
know 1
but 1
I 1
really 1
went 1
in 1
and 1
paid 1
a 1
whole 1
guinea 1
for 1
the 1
stage 1
box 1
To 1
the 1
present 1
day 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
make 1
out 1
why 1
I 1
did 1
so 1
and 1
yet 1
if 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
my 1
dear 1
Harry 1
if 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
missed 1
the 1
greatest 1
romance 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
I 1
see 1
you 1
are 1
laughing 1
It 1
is 1
horrid 1
of 1
you 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
laughing 1
Dorian 1
at 1
least 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
laughing 1
at 1
you 1
But 1
you 1
should 1
not 1
say 1
the 1
greatest 1
romance 1
of 1
your 1
life 1
You 1
should 1
say 1
the 1
first 1
romance 1
of 1
your 1
life 1
You 1
will 1
always 1
be 1
loved 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
always 1
be 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
love 1
A 1
grande 1
passion 1
is 1
the 1
privilege 1
of 1
people 1
who 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
one 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
idle 1
classes 1
of 1
a 1
country 1
Don 1
t 1
be 1
afraid 1
There 1
are 1
exquisite 1
things 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
you 1
This 1
is 1
merely 1
the 1
beginning 1
Do 1
you 1
think 1
my 1
nature 1
so 1
shallow 1
cried 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
angrily 1
No 1
I 1
think 1
your 1
nature 1
so 1
deep 1
How 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
My 1
dear 1
boy 1
the 1
people 1
who 1
love 1
only 1
once 1
in 1
their 1
lives 1
are 1
really 1
the 1
shallow 1
people 1
What 1
they 1
call 1
their 1
loyalty 1
and 1
their 1
fidelity 1
I 1
call 1
either 1
the 1
lethargy 1
of 1
custom 1
or 1
their 1
lack 1
of 1
imagination 1
Faithfulness 1
is 1
to 1
the 1
emotional 1
life 1
what 1
consistency 1
is 1
to 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
the 1
intellect 1
simply 1
a 1
confession 1
of 1
failure 1
Faithfulness 1
I 1
must 1
analyse 1
it 1
some 1
day 1
The 1
passion 1
for 1
property 1
is 1
in 1
it 1
There 1
are 1
many 1
things 1
that 1
we 1
would 1
throw 1
away 1
if 1
we 1
were 1
not 1
afraid 1
that 1
others 1
might 1
pick 1
them 1
up 1
But 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
interrupt 1
you 1
Go 1
on 1
with 1
your 1
story 1
Well 1
I 1
found 1
myself 1
seated 1
in 1
a 1
horrid 1
little 1
private 1
box 1
with 1
a 1
vulgar 1
drop 1
scene 1
staring 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
I 1
looked 1
out 1
from 1
behind 1
the 1
curtain 1
and 1
surveyed 1
the 1
house 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
tawdry 1
affair 1
all 1
Cupids 1
and 1
cornucopias 1
like 1
a 1
third 1
rate 1
wedding 1
cake 1
The 1
gallery 1
and 1
pit 1
were 1
fairly 1
full 1
but 1
the 1
two 1
rows 1
of 1
dingy 1
stalls 1
were 1
quite 1
empty 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
hardly 1
a 1
person 1
in 1
what 1
I 1
suppose 1
they 1
called 1
the 1
dress 1
circle 1
Women 1
went 1
about 1
with 1
oranges 1
and 1
ginger 1
beer 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
terrible 1
consumption 1
of 1
nuts 1
going 1
on 1
It 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
just 1
like 1
the 1
palmy 1
days 1
of 1
the 1
British 1
drama 1
Just 1
like 1
I 1
should 1
fancy 1
and 1
very 1
depressing 1
I 1
began 1
to 1
wonder 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
I 1
should 1
do 1
when 1
I 1
caught 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
play 1
bill 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
the 1
play 1
was 1
Harry 1
I 1
should 1
think 1
The 1
Idiot 1
Boy 1
or 1
Dumb 1
but 1
Innocent 1
Our 1
fathers 1
used 1
to 1
like 1
that 1
sort 1
of 1
piece 1
I 1
believe 1
The 1
longer 1
I 1
live 1
Dorian 1
the 1
more 1
keenly 1
I 1
feel 1
that 1
whatever 1
was 1
good 1
enough 1
for 1
our 1
fathers 1
is 1
not 1
good 1
enough 1
for 1
us 1
In 1
art 1
as 1
in 1
politics 1
les 1
grandperes 1
ont 1
toujours 1
tort 1
This 1
play 1
was 1
good 1
enough 1
for 1
us 1
Harry 1
It 1
was 1
Romeo 1
and 1
Juliet 1
I 1
must 1
admit 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
rather 1
annoyed 1
at 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
seeing 1
Shakespeare 1
done 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
wretched 1
hole 1
of 1
a 1
place 1
Still 1
I 1
felt 1
interested 1
in 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
way 1
At 1
any 1
rate 1
I 1
determined 1
to 1
wait 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
act 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
dreadful 1
orchestra 1
presided 1
over 1
by 1
a 1
young 1
Hebrew 1
who 1
sat 1
at 1
a 1
cracked 1
piano 1
that 1
nearly 1
drove 1
me 1
away 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
drop 1
scene 1
was 1
drawn 1
up 1
and 1
the 1
play 1
began 1
Romeo 1
was 1
a 1
stout 1
elderly 1
gentleman 1
with 1
corked 1
eyebrows 1
a 1
husky 1
tragedy 1
voice 1
and 1
a 1
figure 1
like 1
a 1
beer 1
barrel 1
Mercutio 1
was 1
almost 1
as 1
bad 1
He 1
was 1
played 1
by 1
the 1
low 1
comedian 1
who 1
had 1
introduced 1
gags 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
and 1
was 1
on 1
most 1
friendly 1
terms 1
with 1
the 1
pit 1
They 1
were 1
both 1
as 1
grotesque 1
as 1
the 1
scenery 1
and 1
that 1
looked 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
come 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
country 1
booth 1
But 1
Juliet 1
Harry 1
imagine 1
a 1
girl 1
hardly 1
seventeen 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
flowerlike 1
face 1
a 1
small 1
Greek 1
head 1
with 1
plaited 1
coils 1
of 1
dark 1
brown 1
hair 1
eyes 1
that 1
were 1
violet 1
wells 1
of 1
passion 1
lips 1
that 1
were 1
like 1
the 1
petals 1
of 1
a 1
rose 1
She 1
was 1
the 1
loveliest 1
thing 1
I 1
had 1
ever 1
seen 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
You 1
said 1
to 1
me 1
once 1
that 1
pathos 1
left 1
you 1
unmoved 1
but 1
that 1
beauty 1
mere 1
beauty 1
could 1
fill 1
your 1
eyes 1
with 1
tears 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
Harry 1
I 1
could 1
hardly 1
see 1
this 1
girl 1
for 1
the 1
mist 1
of 1
tears 1
that 1
came 1
across 1
me 1
And 1
her 1
voice 1
I 1
never 1
heard 1
such 1
a 1
voice 1
It 1
was 1
very 1
low 1
at 1
first 1
with 1
deep 1
mellow 1
notes 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
fall 1
singly 1
upon 1
one 1
s 1
ear 1
Then 1
it 1
became 1
a 1
little 1
louder 1
and 1
sounded 1
like 1
a 1
flute 1
or 1
a 1
distant 1
hautboy 1
In 1
the 1
garden 1
scene 1
it 1
had 1
all 1
the 1
tremulous 1
ecstasy 1
that 1
one 1
hears 1
just 1
before 1
dawn 1
when 1
nightingales 1
are 1
singing 1
There 1
were 1
moments 1
later 1
on 1
when 1
it 1
had 1
the 1
wild 1
passion 1
of 1
violins 1
You 1
know 1
how 1
a 1
voice 1
can 1
stir 1
one 1
Your 1
voice 1
and 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
are 1
two 1
things 1
that 1
I 1
shall 1
never 1
forget 1
When 1
I 1
close 1
my 1
eyes 1
I 1
hear 1
them 1
and 1
each 1
of 1
them 1
says 1
something 1
different 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
which 1
to 1
follow 1
Why 1
should 1
I 1
not 1
love 1
her 1
Harry 1
I 1
do 1
love 1
her 1
She 1
is 1
everything 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
life 1
Night 1
after 1
night 1
I 1
go 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
play 1
One 1
evening 1
she 1
is 1
Rosalind 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
evening 1
she 1
is 1
Imogen 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
her 1
die 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
of 1
an 1
Italian 1
tomb 1
sucking 1
the 1
poison 1
from 1
her 1
lover 1
s 1
lips 1
I 1
have 1
watched 1
her 1
wandering 1
through 1
the 1
forest 1
of 1
Arden 1
disguised 1
as 1
a 1
pretty 1
boy 1
in 1
hose 1
and 1
doublet 1
and 1
dainty 1
cap 1
She 1
has 1
been 1
mad 1
and 1
has 1
come 1
into 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
a 1
guilty 1
king 1
and 1
given 1
him 1
rue 1
to 1
wear 1
and 1
bitter 1
herbs 1
to 1
taste 1
of 1
She 1
has 1
been 1
innocent 1
and 1
the 1
black 1
hands 1
of 1
jealousy 1
have 1
crushed 1
her 1
reedlike 1
throat 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
her 1
in 1
every 1
age 1
and 1
in 1
every 1
costume 1
Ordinary 1
women 1
never 1
appeal 1
to 1
one 1
s 1
imagination 1
They 1
are 1
limited 1
to 1
their 1
century 1
No 1
glamour 1
ever 1
transfigures 1
them 1
One 1
knows 1
their 1
minds 1
as 1
easily 1
as 1
one 1
knows 1
their 1
bonnets 1
One 1
can 1
always 1
find 1
them 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
mystery 1
in 1
any 1
of 1
them 1
They 1
ride 1
in 1
the 1
park 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
chatter 1
at 1
tea 1
parties 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
They 1
have 1
their 1
stereotyped 1
smile 1
and 1
their 1
fashionable 1
manner 1
They 1
are 1
quite 1
obvious 1
But 1
an 1
actress 1
How 1
different 1
an 1
actress 1
is 1
Harry 1
why 1
didn 1
t 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
worth 1
loving 1
is 1
an 1
actress 1
Because 1
I 1
have 1
loved 1
so 1
many 1
of 1
them 1
Dorian 1
Oh 1
yes 1
horrid 1
people 1
with 1
dyed 1
hair 1
and 1
painted 1
faces 1
Don 1
t 1
run 1
down 1
dyed 1
hair 1
and 1
painted 1
faces 1
There 1
is 1
an 1
extraordinary 1
charm 1
in 1
them 1
sometimes 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
I 1
wish 1
now 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
told 1
you 1
about 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
You 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
helped 1
telling 1
me 1
Dorian 1
All 1
through 1
your 1
life 1
you 1
will 1
tell 1
me 1
everything 1
you 1
do 1
Yes 1
Harry 1
I 1
believe 1
that 1
is 1
true 1
I 1
cannot 1
help 1
telling 1
you 1
things 1
You 1
have 1
a 1
curious 1
influence 1
over 1
me 1
If 1
I 1
ever 1
did 1
a 1
crime 1
I 1
would 1
come 1
and 1
confess 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
You 1
would 1
understand 1
me 1
People 1
like 1
you 1
the 1
wilful 1
sunbeams 1
of 1
life 1
don 1
t 1
commit 1
crimes 1
Dorian 1
But 1
I 1
am 1
much 1
obliged 1
for 1
the 1
compliment 1
all 1
the 1
same 1
And 1
now 1
tell 1
me 1
reach 1
me 1
the 1
matches 1
like 1
a 1
good 1
boy 1
thanks 1
what 1
are 1
your 1
actual 1
relations 1
with 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
leaped 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
with 1
flushed 1
cheeks 1
and 1
burning 1
eyes 1
Harry 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
is 1
sacred 1
It 1
is 1
only 1
the 1
sacred 1
things 1
that 1
are 1
worth 1
touching 1
Dorian 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
with 1
a 1
strange 1
touch 1
of 1
pathos 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
But 1
why 1
should 1
you 1
be 1
annoyed 1
I 1
suppose 1
she 1
will 1
belong 1
to 1
you 1
some 1
day 1
When 1
one 1
is 1
in 1
love 1
one 1
always 1
begins 1
by 1
deceiving 1
one 1
s 1
self 1
and 1
one 1
always 1
ends 1
by 1
deceiving 1
others 1
That 1
is 1
what 1
the 1
world 1
calls 1
a 1
romance 1
You 1
know 1
her 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
I 1
suppose 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
know 1
her 1
On 1
the 1
first 1
night 1
I 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
theatre 1
the 1
horrid 1
old 1
Jew 1
came 1
round 1
to 1
the 1
box 1
after 1
the 1
performance 1
was 1
over 1
and 1
offered 1
to 1
take 1
me 1
behind 1
the 1
scenes 1
and 1
introduce 1
me 1
to 1
her 1
I 1
was 1
furious 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
Juliet 1
had 1
been 1
dead 1
for 1
hundreds 1
of 1
years 1
and 1
that 1
her 1
body 1
was 1
lying 1
in 1
a 1
marble 1
tomb 1
in 1
Verona 1
I 1
think 1
from 1
his 1
blank 1
look 1
of 1
amazement 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
under 1
the 1
impression 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
taken 1
too 1
much 1
champagne 1
or 1
something 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
surprised 1
Then 1
he 1
asked 1
me 1
if 1
I 1
wrote 1
for 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
newspapers 1
I 1
told 1
him 1
I 1
never 1
even 1
read 1
them 1
He 1
seemed 1
terribly 1
disappointed 1
at 1
that 1
and 1
confided 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
dramatic 1
critics 1
were 1
in 1
a 1
conspiracy 1
against 1
him 1
and 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
every 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
to 1
be 1
bought 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
wonder 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
quite 1
right 1
there 1
But 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
judging 1
from 1
their 1
appearance 1
most 1
of 1
them 1
cannot 1
be 1
at 1
all 1
expensive 1
Well 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
think 1
they 1
were 1
beyond 1
his 1
means 1
laughed 1
Dorian 1
By 1
this 1
time 1
however 1
the 1
lights 1
were 1
being 1
put 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
theatre 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
go 1
He 1
wanted 1
me 1
to 1
try 1
some 1
cigars 1
that 1
he 1
strongly 1
recommended 1
I 1
declined 1
The 1
next 1
night 1
of 1
course 1
I 1
arrived 1
at 1
the 1
place 1
again 1
When 1
he 1
saw 1
me 1
he 1
made 1
me 1
a 1
low 1
bow 1
and 1
assured 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
munificent 1
patron 1
of 1
art 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
most 1
offensive 1
brute 1
though 1
he 1
had 1
an 1
extraordinary 1
passion 1
for 1
Shakespeare 1
He 1
told 1
me 1
once 1
with 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
pride 1
that 1
his 1
five 1
bankruptcies 1
were 1
entirely 1
due 1
to 1
The 1
Bard 1
as 1
he 1
insisted 1
on 1
calling 1
him 1
He 1
seemed 1
to 1
think 1
it 1
a 1
distinction 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
distinction 1
my 1
dear 1
Dorian 1
a 1
great 1
distinction 1
Most 1
people 1
become 1
bankrupt 1
through 1
having 1
invested 1
too 1
heavily 1
in 1
the 1
prose 1
of 1
life 1
To 1
have 1
ruined 1
one 1
s 1
self 1
over 1
poetry 1
is 1
an 1
honour 1
But 1
when 1
did 1
you 1
first 1
speak 1
to 1
Miss 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
The 1
third 1
night 1
She 1
had 1
been 1
playing 1
Rosalind 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
going 1
round 1
I 1
had 1
thrown 1
her 1
some 1
flowers 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
looked 1
at 1
me 1
at 1
least 1
I 1
fancied 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
The 1
old 1
Jew 1
was 1
persistent 1
He 1
seemed 1
determined 1
to 1
take 1
me 1
behind 1
so 1
I 1
consented 1
It 1
was 1
curious 1
my 1
not 1
wanting 1
to 1
know 1
her 1
wasn 1
t 1
it 1
No 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
so 1
My 1
dear 1
Harry 1
why 1
I 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
some 1
other 1
time 1
Now 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
know 1
about 1
the 1
girl 1
Sibyl 1
Oh 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
shy 1
and 1
so 1
gentle 1
There 1
is 1
something 1
of 1
a 1
child 1
about 1
her 1
Her 1
eyes 1
opened 1
wide 1
in 1
exquisite 1
wonder 1
when 1
I 1
told 1
her 1
what 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
her 1
performance 1
and 1
she 1
seemed 1
quite 1
unconscious 1
of 1
her 1
power 1
I 1
think 1
we 1
were 1
both 1
rather 1
nervous 1
The 1
old 1
Jew 1
stood 1
grinning 1
at 1
the 1
doorway 1
of 1
the 1
dusty 1
greenroom 1
making 1
elaborate 1
speeches 1
about 1
us 1
both 1
while 1
we 1
stood 1
looking 1
at 1
each 1
other 1
like 1
children 1
He 1
would 1
insist 1
on 1
calling 1
me 1
My 1
Lord 1
so 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
assure 1
Sibyl 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
She 1
said 1
quite 1
simply 1
to 1
me 1
You 1
look 1
more 1
like 1
a 1
prince 1
I 1
must 1
call 1
you 1
Prince 1
Charming 1
Upon 1
my 1
word 1
Dorian 1
Miss 1
Sibyl 1
knows 1
how 1
to 1
pay 1
compliments 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
understand 1
her 1
Harry 1
She 1
regarded 1
me 1
merely 1
as 1
a 1
person 1
in 1
a 1
play 1
She 1
knows 1
nothing 1
of 1
life 1
She 1
lives 1
with 1
her 1
mother 1
a 1
faded 1
tired 1
woman 1
who 1
played 1
Lady 1
Capulet 1
in 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
magenta 1
dressing 1
wrapper 1
on 1
the 1
first 1
night 1
and 1
looks 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
seen 1
better 1
days 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
look 1
It 1
depresses 1
me 1
murmured 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
examining 1
his 1
rings 1
The 1
Jew 1
wanted 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
her 1
history 1
but 1
I 1
said 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
interest 1
me 1
You 1
were 1
quite 1
right 1
There 1
is 1
always 1
something 1
infinitely 1
mean 1
about 1
other 1
people 1
s 1
tragedies 1
Sibyl 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
I 1
care 1
about 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
to 1
me 1
where 1
she 1
came 1
from 1
From 1
her 1
little 1
head 1
to 1
her 1
little 1
feet 1
she 1
is 1
absolutely 1
and 1
entirely 1
divine 1
Every 1
night 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
I 1
go 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
act 1
and 1
every 1
night 1
she 1
is 1
more 1
marvellous 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
reason 1
I 1
suppose 1
that 1
you 1
never 1
dine 1
with 1
me 1
now 1
I 1
thought 1
you 1
must 1
have 1
some 1
curious 1
romance 1
on 1
hand 1
You 1
have 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
quite 1
what 1
I 1
expected 1
My 1
dear 1
Harry 1
we 1
either 1
lunch 1
or 1
sup 1
together 1
every 1
day 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
to 1
the 1
opera 1
with 1
you 1
several 1
times 1
said 1
Dorian 1
opening 1
his 1
blue 1
eyes 1
in 1
wonder 1
You 1
always 1
come 1
dreadfully 1
late 1
Well 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
help 1
going 1
to 1
see 1
Sibyl 1
play 1
he 1
cried 1
even 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
for 1
a 1
single 1
act 1
I 1
get 1
hungry 1
for 1
her 1
presence 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
wonderful 1
soul 1
that 1
is 1
hidden 1
away 1
in 1
that 1
little 1
ivory 1
body 1
I 1
am 1
filled 1
with 1
awe 1
You 1
can 1
dine 1
with 1
me 1
to 1
night 1
Dorian 1
can 1
t 1
you 1
He 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
To 1
night 1
she 1
is 1
Imogen 1
he 1
answered 1
and 1
to 1
morrow 1
night 1
she 1
will 1
be 1
Juliet 1
When 1
is 1
she 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
Never 1
I 1
congratulate 1
you 1
How 1
horrid 1
you 1
are 1
She 1
is 1
all 1
the 1
great 1
heroines 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
in 1
one 1
She 1
is 1
more 1
than 1
an 1
individual 1
You 1
laugh 1
but 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
she 1
has 1
genius 1
I 1
love 1
her 1
and 1
I 1
must 1
make 1
her 1
love 1
me 1
You 1
who 1
know 1
all 1
the 1
secrets 1
of 1
life 1
tell 1
me 1
how 1
to 1
charm 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
to 1
love 1
me 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
make 1
Romeo 1
jealous 1
I 1
want 1
the 1
dead 1
lovers 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
hear 1
our 1
laughter 1
and 1
grow 1
sad 1
I 1
want 1
a 1
breath 1
of 1
our 1
passion 1
to 1
stir 1
their 1
dust 1
into 1
consciousness 1
to 1
wake 1
their 1
ashes 1
into 1
pain 1
My 1
God 1
Harry 1
how 1
I 1
worship 1
her 1
He 1
was 1
walking 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
Hectic 1
spots 1
of 1
red 1
burned 1
on 1
his 1
cheeks 1
He 1
was 1
terribly 1
excited 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
watched 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
subtle 1
sense 1
of 1
pleasure 1
How 1
different 1
he 1
was 1
now 1
from 1
the 1
shy 1
frightened 1
boy 1
he 1
had 1
met 1
in 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
s 1
studio 1
His 1
nature 1
had 1
developed 1
like 1
a 1
flower 1
had 1
borne 1
blossoms 1
of 1
scarlet 1
flame 1
Out 1
of 1
its 1
secret 1
hiding 1
place 1
had 1
crept 1
his 1
soul 1
and 1
desire 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
meet 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
And 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
propose 1
to 1
do 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
at 1
last 1
I 1
want 1
you 1
and 1
Basil 1
to 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
some 1
night 1
and 1
see 1
her 1
act 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
the 1
slightest 1
fear 1
of 1
the 1
result 1
You 1
are 1
certain 1
to 1
acknowledge 1
her 1
genius 1
Then 1
we 1
must 1
get 1
her 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
Jew 1
s 1
hands 1
She 1
is 1
bound 1
to 1
him 1
for 1
three 1
years 1
at 1
least 1
for 1
two 1
years 1
and 1
eight 1
months 1
from 1
the 1
present 1
time 1
I 1
shall 1
have 1
to 1
pay 1
him 1
something 1
of 1
course 1
When 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
settled 1
I 1
shall 1
take 1
a 1
West 1
End 1
theatre 1
and 1
bring 1
her 1
out 1
properly 1
She 1
will 1
make 1
the 1
world 1
as 1
mad 1
as 1
she 1
has 1
made 1
me 1
That 1
would 1
be 1
impossible 1
my 1
dear 1
boy 1
Yes 1
she 1
will 1
She 1
has 1
not 1
merely 1
art 1
consummate 1
art 1
instinct 1
in 1
her 1
but 1
she 1
has 1
personality 1
also 1
and 1
you 1
have 1
often 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
personalities 1
not 1
principles 1
that 1
move 1
the 1
age 1
Well 1
what 1
night 1
shall 1
we 1
go 1
Let 1
me 1
see 1
To 1
day 1
is 1
Tuesday 1
Let 1
us 1
fix 1
to 1
morrow 1
She 1
plays 1
Juliet 1
to 1
morrow 1
All 1
right 1
The 1
Bristol 1
at 1
eight 1
o 1
clock 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
get 1
Basil 1
Not 1
eight 1
Harry 1
please 1
Half 1
past 1
six 1
We 1
must 1
be 1
there 1
before 1
the 1
curtain 1
rises 1
You 1
must 1
see 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
act 1
where 1
she 1
meets 1
Romeo 1
Half 1
past 1
six 1
What 1
an 1
hour 1
It 1
will 1
be 1
like 1
having 1
a 1
meat 1
tea 1
or 1
reading 1
an 1
English 1
novel 1
It 1
must 1
be 1
seven 1
No 1
gentleman 1
dines 1
before 1
seven 1
Shall 1
you 1
see 1
Basil 1
between 1
this 1
and 1
then 1
Or 1
shall 1
I 1
write 1
to 1
him 1
Dear 1
Basil 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
laid 1
eyes 1
on 1
him 1
for 1
a 1
week 1
It 1
is 1
rather 1
horrid 1
of 1
me 1
as 1
he 1
has 1
sent 1
me 1
my 1
portrait 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
wonderful 1
frame 1
specially 1
designed 1
by 1
himself 1
and 1
though 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
little 1
jealous 1
of 1
the 1
picture 1
for 1
being 1
a 1
whole 1
month 1
younger 1
than 1
I 1
am 1
I 1
must 1
admit 1
that 1
I 1
delight 1
in 1
it 1
Perhaps 1
you 1
had 1
better 1
write 1
to 1
him 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
alone 1
He 1
says 1
things 1
that 1
annoy 1
me 1
He 1
gives 1
me 1
good 1
advice 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
smiled 1
People 1
are 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
giving 1
away 1
what 1
they 1
need 1
most 1
themselves 1
It 1
is 1
what 1
I 1
call 1
the 1
depth 1
of 1
generosity 1
Oh 1
Basil 1
is 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
fellows 1
but 1
he 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
just 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
a 1
Philistine 1
Since 1
I 1
have 1
known 1
you 1
Harry 1
I 1
have 1
discovered 1
that 1
Basil 1
my 1
dear 1
boy 1
puts 1
everything 1
that 1
is 1
charming 1
in 1
him 1
into 1
his 1
work 1
The 1
consequence 1
is 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
nothing 1
left 1
for 1
life 1
but 1
his 1
prejudices 1
his 1
principles 1
and 1
his 1
common 1
sense 1
The 1
only 1
artists 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
known 1
who 1
are 1
personally 1
delightful 1
are 1
bad 1
artists 1
Good 1
artists 1
exist 1
simply 1
in 1
what 1
they 1
make 1
and 1
consequently 1
are 1
perfectly 1
uninteresting 1
in 1
what 1
they 1
are 1
A 1
great 1
poet 1
a 1
really 1
great 1
poet 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
unpoetical 1
of 1
all 1
creatures 1
But 1
inferior 1
poets 1
are 1
absolutely 1
fascinating 1
The 1
worse 1
their 1
rhymes 1
are 1
the 1
more 1
picturesque 1
they 1
look 1
The 1
mere 1
fact 1
of 1
having 1
published 1
a 1
book 1
of 1
second 1
rate 1
sonnets 1
makes 1
a 1
man 1
quite 1
irresistible 1
He 1
lives 1
the 1
poetry 1
that 1
he 1
cannot 1
write 1
The 1
others 1
write 1
the 1
poetry 1
that 1
they 1
dare 1
not 1
realize 1
I 1
wonder 1
is 1
that 1
really 1
so 1
Harry 1
said 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
putting 1
some 1
perfume 1
on 1
his 1
handkerchief 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
large 1
gold 1
topped 1
bottle 1
that 1
stood 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
It 1
must 1
be 1
if 1
you 1
say 1
it 1
And 1
now 1
I 1
am 1
off 1
Imogen 1
is 1
waiting 1
for 1
me 1
Don 1
t 1
forget 1
about 1
to 1
morrow 1
Good 1
bye 1
As 1
he 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
s 1
heavy 1
eyelids 1
drooped 1
and 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
Certainly 1
few 1
people 1
had 1
ever 1
interested 1
him 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
and 1
yet 1
the 1
lad 1
s 1
mad 1
adoration 1
of 1
some 1
one 1
else 1
caused 1
him 1
not 1
the 1
slightest 1
pang 1
of 1
annoyance 1
or 1
jealousy 1
He 1
was 1
pleased 1
by 1
it 1
It 1
made 1
him 1
a 1
more 1
interesting 1
study 1
He 1
had 1
been 1
always 1
enthralled 1
by 1
the 1
methods 1
of 1
natural 1
science 1
but 1
the 1
ordinary 1
subject 1
matter 1
of 1
that 1
science 1
had 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
trivial 1
and 1
of 1
no 1
import 1
And 1
so 1
he 1
had 1
begun 1
by 1
vivisecting 1
himself 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
ended 1
by 1
vivisecting 1
others 1
Human 1
life 1
that 1
appeared 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
one 1
thing 1
worth 1
investigating 1
Compared 1
to 1
it 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
else 1
of 1
any 1
value 1
It 1
was 1
true 1
that 1
as 1
one 1
watched 1
life 1
in 1
its 1
curious 1
crucible 1
of 1
pain 1
and 1
pleasure 1
one 1
could 1
not 1
wear 1
over 1
one 1
s 1
face 1
a 1
mask 1
of 1
glass 1
nor 1
keep 1
the 1
sulphurous 1
fumes 1
from 1
troubling 1
the 1
brain 1
and 1
making 1
the 1
imagination 1
turbid 1
with 1
monstrous 1
fancies 1
and 1
misshapen 1
dreams 1
There 1
were 1
poisons 1
so 1
subtle 1
that 1
to 1
know 1
their 1
properties 1
one 1
had 1
to 1
sicken 1
of 1
them 1
There 1
were 1
maladies 1
so 1
strange 1
that 1
one 1
had 1
to 1
pass 1
through 1
them 1
if 1
one 1
sought 1
to 1
understand 1
their 1
nature 1
And 1
yet 1
what 1
a 1
great 1
reward 1
one 1
received 1
How 1
wonderful 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
became 1
to 1
one 1
To 1
note 1
the 1
curious 1
hard 1
logic 1
of 1
passion 1
and 1
the 1
emotional 1
coloured 1
life 1
of 1
the 1
intellect 1
to 1
observe 1
where 1
they 1
met 1
and 1
where 1
they 1
separated 1
at 1
what 1
point 1
they 1
were 1
in 1
unison 1
and 1
at 1
what 1
point 1
they 1
were 1
at 1
discord 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
delight 1
in 1
that 1
What 1
matter 1
what 1
the 1
cost 1
was 1
One 1
could 1
never 1
pay 1
too 1
high 1
a 1
price 1
for 1
any 1
sensation 1
He 1
was 1
conscious 1
and 1
the 1
thought 1
brought 1
a 1
gleam 1
of 1
pleasure 1
into 1
his 1
brown 1
agate 1
eyes 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
through 1
certain 1
words 1
of 1
his 1
musical 1
words 1
said 1
with 1
musical 1
utterance 1
that 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
s 1
soul 1
had 1
turned 1
to 1
this 1
white 1
girl 1
and 1
bowed 1
in 1
worship 1
before 1
her 1
To 1
a 1
large 1
extent 1
the 1
lad 1
was 1
his 1
own 1
creation 1
He 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
premature 1
That 1
was 1
something 1
Ordinary 1
people 1
waited 1
till 1
life 1
disclosed 1
to 1
them 1
its 1
secrets 1
but 1
to 1
the 1
few 1
to 1
the 1
elect 1
the 1
mysteries 1
of 1
life 1
were 1
revealed 1
before 1
the 1
veil 1
was 1
drawn 1
away 1
Sometimes 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
effect 1
of 1
art 1
and 1
chiefly 1
of 1
the 1
art 1
of 1
literature 1
which 1
dealt 1
immediately 1
with 1
the 1
passions 1
and 1
the 1
intellect 1
But 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
complex 1
personality 1
took 1
the 1
place 1
and 1
assumed 1
the 1
office 1
of 1
art 1
was 1
indeed 1
in 1
its 1
way 1
a 1
real 1
work 1
of 1
art 1
life 1
having 1
its 1
elaborate 1
masterpieces 1
just 1
as 1
poetry 1
has 1
or 1
sculpture 1
or 1
painting 1
Yes 1
the 1
lad 1
was 1
premature 1
He 1
was 1
gathering 1
his 1
harvest 1
while 1
it 1
was 1
yet 1
spring 1
The 1
pulse 1
and 1
passion 1
of 1
youth 1
were 1
in 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
becoming 1
self 1
conscious 1
It 1
was 1
delightful 1
to 1
watch 1
him 1
With 1
his 1
beautiful 1
face 1
and 1
his 1
beautiful 1
soul 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
thing 1
to 1
wonder 1
at 1
It 1
was 1
no 1
matter 1
how 1
it 1
all 1
ended 1
or 1
was 1
destined 1
to 1
end 1
He 1
was 1
like 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
gracious 1
figures 1
in 1
a 1
pageant 1
or 1
a 1
play 1
whose 1
joys 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
remote 1
from 1
one 1
but 1
whose 1
sorrows 1
stir 1
one 1
s 1
sense 1
of 1
beauty 1
and 1
whose 1
wounds 1
are 1
like 1
red 1
roses 1
Soul 1
and 1
body 2
and 1
soul 1
how 1
mysterious 1
they 1
were 1
There 1
was 1
animalism 1
in 1
the 1
soul 1
and 1
the 1
body 1
had 1
its 1
moments 1
of 1
spirituality 1
The 1
senses 1
could 1
refine 1
and 1
the 1
intellect 1
could 1
degrade 1
Who 1
could 1
say 1
where 1
the 1
fleshly 1
impulse 1
ceased 1
or 1
the 1
psychical 1
impulse 1
began 1
How 1
shallow 1
were 1
the 1
arbitrary 1
definitions 1
of 1
ordinary 1
psychologists 1
And 1
yet 1
how 1
difficult 1
to 1
decide 1
between 1
the 1
claims 1
of 1
the 1
various 1
schools 1
Was 1
the 1
soul 1
a 1
shadow 1
seated 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
sin 1
Or 1
was 1
the 1
body 1
really 1
in 1
the 1
soul 1
as 1
Giordano 1
Bruno 1
thought 1
The 1
separation 1
of 1
spirit 1
from 1
matter 1
was 1
a 1
mystery 1
and 1
the 1
union 1
of 1
spirit 1
with 1
matter 1
was 1
a 1
mystery 1
also 1
He 1
began 1
to 1
wonder 1
whether 1
we 1
could 1
ever 1
make 1
psychology 1
so 1
absolute 1
a 1
science 1
that 1
each 1
little 1
spring 1
of 1
life 1
would 1
be 1
revealed 1
to 1
us 1
As 1
it 1
was 1
we 1
always 1
misunderstood 1
ourselves 1
and 1
rarely 1
understood 1
others 1
Experience 1
was 1
of 1
no 1
ethical 1
value 1
It 1
was 1
merely 1
the 1
name 1
men 1
gave 1
to 1
their 1
mistakes 1
Moralists 1
had 1
as 1
a 1
rule 1
regarded 1
it 1
as 1
a 1
mode 1
of 1
warning 1
had 1
claimed 1
for 1
it 1
a 1
certain 1
ethical 1
efficacy 1
in 1
the 1
formation 1
of 1
character 1
had 1
praised 1
it 1
as 1
something 1
that 1
taught 1
us 1
what 1
to 1
follow 1
and 1
showed 1
us 1
what 1
to 1
avoid 1
But 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
motive 1
power 1
in 1
experience 1
It 1
was 1
as 1
little 1
of 1
an 1
active 1
cause 1
as 1
conscience 1
itself 1
All 1
that 1
it 1
really 1
demonstrated 1
was 1
that 1
our 1
future 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
our 1
past 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
sin 1
we 1
had 1
done 1
once 1
and 1
with 1
loathing 1
we 1
would 1
do 1
many 1
times 1
and 1
with 1
joy 1
It 1
was 1
clear 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
experimental 1
method 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
method 1
by 1
which 1
one 1
could 1
arrive 1
at 1
any 1
scientific 1
analysis 1
of 1
the 1
passions 1
and 1
certainly 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
was 1
a 1
subject 1
made 1
to 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
seemed 1
to 1
promise 1
rich 1
and 1
fruitful 1
results 1
His 1
sudden 1
mad 1
love 1
for 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
was 1
a 1
psychological 1
phenomenon 1
of 1
no 1
small 1
interest 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
curiosity 1
had 1
much 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
curiosity 1
and 1
the 1
desire 1
for 1
new 1
experiences 1
yet 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
simple 1
but 1
rather 1
a 1
very 1
complex 1
passion 1
What 1
there 1
was 1
in 1
it 1
of 1
the 1
purely 1
sensuous 1
instinct 1
of 1
boyhood 1
had 1
been 1
transformed 1
by 1
the 1
workings 1
of 1
the 1
imagination 1
changed 1
into 1
something 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
the 1
lad 1
himself 1
to 1
be 1
remote 1
from 1
sense 1
and 1
was 1
for 1
that 1
very 1
reason 1
all 1
the 1
more 1
dangerous 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
passions 1
about 1
whose 1
origin 1
we 1
deceived 1
ourselves 1
that 1
tyrannized 1
most 1
strongly 1
over 1
us 1
Our 1
weakest 1
motives 1
were 1
those 1
of 1
whose 1
nature 1
we 1
were 1
conscious 1
It 1
often 1
happened 1
that 1
when 1
we 1
thought 1
we 1
were 1
experimenting 1
on 1
others 1
we 1
were 1
really 1
experimenting 1
on 1
ourselves 1
While 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
sat 1
dreaming 1
on 1
these 1
things 1
a 1
knock 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
his 1
valet 1
entered 1
and 1
reminded 1
him 1
it 1
was 1
time 1
to 1
dress 1
for 1
dinner 1
He 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
looked 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
street 1
The 1
sunset 1
had 1
smitten 1
into 1
scarlet 1
gold 1
the 1
upper 1
windows 1
of 1
the 1
houses 1
opposite 1
The 1
panes 1
glowed 1
like 1
plates 1
of 1
heated 1
metal 1
The 1
sky 1
above 1
was 1
like 1
a 1
faded 1
rose 1
He 1
thought 1
of 1
his 1
friend 1
s 1
young 1
fiery 1
coloured 1
life 1
and 1
wondered 1
how 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
going 1
to 1
end 1
When 1
he 1
arrived 1
home 1
about 1
half 1
past 1
twelve 1
o 1
clock 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
telegram 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
hall 1
table 1
He 1
opened 1
it 1
and 1
found 1
it 1
was 1
from 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
It 1
was 1
to 1
tell 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
engaged 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
to 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
CHAPTER 1
Mother 2
I 1
am 1
so 1
happy 1
whispered 1
the 1
girl 1
burying 1
her 1
face 1
in 1
the 1
lap 1
of 1
the 1
faded 1
tired 1
looking 1
woman 1
who 1
with 1
back 1
turned 1
to 1
the 1
shrill 1
intrusive 1
light 1
was 1
sitting 1
in 1
the 1
one 1
arm 1
chair 1
that 1
their 1
dingy 1
sitting 1
room 1
contained 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
happy 1
she 1
repeated 1
and 1
you 1
must 1
be 1
happy 1
too 1
Mrs 1
Vane 1
winced 1
and 1
put 1
her 1
thin 1
bismuth 1
whitened 1
hands 1
on 1
her 1
daughter 1
s 1
head 1
Happy 1
she 1
echoed 1
I 1
am 1
only 1
happy 1
Sibyl 1
when 1
I 1
see 1
you 1
act 1
You 1
must 1
not 1
think 1
of 1
anything 1
but 1
your 1
acting 1
Mr 1
Isaacs 1
has 1
been 1
very 1
good 1
to 1
us 1
and 1
we 1
owe 1
him 1
money 1
The 1
girl 1
looked 1
up 1
and 1
pouted 1
Money 1
Mother 1
she 1
cried 1
what 1
does 1
money 1
matter 1
Love 1
is 1
more 1
than 1
money 1
Mr 1
Isaacs 1
has 1
advanced 1
us 1
fifty 1
pounds 1
to 1
pay 1
off 1
our 1
debts 1
and 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
proper 1
outfit 1
for 1
James 1
You 1
must 1
not 1
forget 1
that 1
Sibyl 1
Fifty 1
pounds 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
large 1
sum 1
Mr 1
Isaacs 1
has 1
been 1
most 1
considerate 1
He 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
gentleman 1
Mother 1
and 1
I 1
hate 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
talks 1
to 1
me 1
said 1
the 1
girl 1
rising 1
to 1
her 1
feet 1
and 1
going 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
how 1
we 1
could 1
manage 1
without 1
him 1
answered 1
the 1
elder 1
woman 1
querulously 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
tossed 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
laughed 1
We 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
him 1
any 1
more 1
Mother 1
Prince 1
Charming 1
rules 1
life 1
for 1
us 1
now 1
Then 1
she 1
paused 1
A 1
rose 1
shook 1
in 1
her 1
blood 1
and 1
shadowed 1
her 1
cheeks 1
Quick 1
breath 1
parted 1
the 1
petals 1
of 1
her 1
lips 1
They 1
trembled 1
Some 1
southern 1
wind 1
of 1
passion 1
swept 1
over 1
her 1
and 1
stirred 1
the 1
dainty 1
folds 1
of 1
her 1
dress 1
I 1
love 1
him 1
she 1
said 1
simply 1
Foolish 1
child 1
foolish 1
child 1
was 1
the 1
parrot 1
phrase 1
flung 1
in 1
answer 1
The 1
waving 1
of 1
crooked 1
false 1
jewelled 1
fingers 1
gave 1
grotesqueness 1
to 1
the 1
words 1
The 1
girl 1
laughed 1
again 1
The 1
joy 1
of 1
a 1
caged 1
bird 1
was 1
in 1
her 1
voice 1
Her 1
eyes 1
caught 1
the 1
melody 1
and 1
echoed 1
it 1
in 1
radiance 1
then 1
closed 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
as 1
though 1
to 1
hide 1
their 1
secret 1
When 1
they 1
opened 1
the 1
mist 1
of 1
a 1
dream 1
had 1
passed 1
across 1
them 1
Thin 1
lipped 1
wisdom 1
spoke 1
at 1
her 1
from 1
the 1
worn 1
chair 1
hinted 1
at 1
prudence 1
quoted 1
from 1
that 1
book 1
of 1
cowardice 1
whose 1
author 1
apes 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
common 1
sense 1
She 1
did 1
not 1
listen 1
She 1
was 1
free 1
in 1
her 1
prison 1
of 1
passion 1
Her 1
prince 1
Prince 1
Charming 1
was 1
with 1
her 1
She 1
had 1
called 1
on 1
memory 1
to 1
remake 1
him 1
She 1
had 1
sent 1
her 1
soul 1
to 1
search 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
it 1
had 1
brought 1
him 1
back 1
His 1
kiss 1
burned 1
again 1
upon 1
her 1
mouth 1
Her 1
eyelids 1
were 1
warm 1
with 1
his 1
breath 1
Then 1
wisdom 1
altered 1
its 1
method 1
and 1
spoke 1
of 1
espial 1
and 1
discovery 1
This 1
young 1
man 1
might 1
be 1
rich 1
If 1
so 1
marriage 1
should 1
be 1
thought 1
of 1
Against 1
the 1
shell 1
of 1
her 1
ear 1
broke 1
the 1
waves 1
of 1
worldly 1
cunning 1
The 1
arrows 1
of 1
craft 1
shot 1
by 1
her 1
She 1
saw 1
the 1
thin 1
lips 1
moving 1
and 1
smiled 1
Suddenly 1
she 1
felt 1
the 1
need 1
to 1
speak 1
The 1
wordy 1
silence 1
troubled 1
her 1
Mother 2
she 1
cried 1
why 1
does 1
he 1
love 1
me 1
so 1
much 1
I 1
know 1
why 1
I 1
love 1
him 1
I 1
love 1
him 1
because 1
he 1
is 1
like 1
what 1
love 1
himself 1
should 1
be 1
But 1
what 1
does 1
he 1
see 1
in 1
me 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
worthy 1
of 1
him 1
And 1
yet 1
why 1
I 1
cannot 1
tell 1
though 1
I 1
feel 1
so 1
much 1
beneath 1
him 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
feel 1
humble 1
I 1
feel 1
proud 1
terribly 1
proud 1
Mother 1
did 1
you 1
love 1
my 1
father 1
as 1
I 1
love 1
Prince 1
Charming 1
The 1
elder 1
woman 1
grew 1
pale 1
beneath 1
the 1
coarse 1
powder 1
that 1
daubed 1
her 1
cheeks 1
and 1
her 1
dry 1
lips 1
twitched 1
with 1
a 1
spasm 1
of 1
pain 1
Sybil 1
rushed 1
to 1
her 1
flung 1
her 1
arms 1
round 1
her 1
neck 1
and 1
kissed 1
her 1
Forgive 1
me 1
Mother 1
I 1
know 1
it 1
pains 1
you 1
to 1
talk 1
about 1
our 1
father 1
But 1
it 1
only 1
pains 1
you 1
because 1
you 1
loved 1
him 1
so 1
much 1
Don 1
t 1
look 1
so 1
sad 1
I 1
am 1
as 1
happy 1
to 1
day 1
as 1
you 1
were 1
twenty 1
years 1
ago 1
Ah 1
let 1
me 1
be 1
happy 1
for 1
ever 1
My 1
child 1
you 1
are 1
far 1
too 1
young 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
falling 1
in 1
love 1
Besides 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
of 1
this 1
young 1
man 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
even 1
know 1
his 1
name 1
The 1
whole 1
thing 1
is 1
most 1
inconvenient 1
and 1
really 1
when 1
James 1
is 1
going 1
away 1
to 1
Australia 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
so 1
much 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
I 1
must 1
say 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
shown 1
more 1
consideration 1
However 1
as 1
I 1
said 1
before 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
rich 1
Ah 1
Mother 2
let 1
me 1
be 1
happy 1
Mrs 1
Vane 1
glanced 1
at 1
her 1
and 1
with 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
false 1
theatrical 1
gestures 1
that 1
so 1
often 1
become 1
a 1
mode 1
of 1
second 1
nature 1
to 1
a 1
stage 1
player 1
clasped 1
her 1
in 1
her 1
arms 1
At 1
this 1
moment 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
a 1
young 1
lad 1
with 1
rough 1
brown 1
hair 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
He 1
was 1
thick 1
set 1
of 1
figure 1
and 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
feet 1
were 1
large 1
and 1
somewhat 1
clumsy 1
in 1
movement 1
He 1
was 1
not 1
so 1
finely 1
bred 1
as 1
his 1
sister 1
One 1
would 1
hardly 1
have 1
guessed 1
the 1
close 1
relationship 1
that 1
existed 1
between 1
them 1
Mrs 1
Vane 1
fixed 1
her 1
eyes 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
intensified 1
her 1
smile 1
She 1
mentally 1
elevated 1
her 1
son 1
to 1
the 1
dignity 1
of 1
an 1
audience 1
She 1
felt 1
sure 1
that 1
the 1
tableau 1
was 1
interesting 1
You 1
might 1
keep 1
some 1
of 1
your 1
kisses 1
for 1
me 1
Sibyl 1
I 1
think 1
said 1
the 1
lad 1
with 1
a 1
good 1
natured 1
grumble 1
Ah 1
but 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
being 1
kissed 1
Jim 1
she 1
cried 1
You 1
are 1
a 1
dreadful 1
old 1
bear 1
And 1
she 1
ran 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
hugged 1
him 1
James 1
Vane 1
looked 1
into 1
his 1
sister 1
s 1
face 1
with 1
tenderness 1
I 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
come 1
out 1
with 1
me 1
for 1
a 1
walk 1
Sibyl 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
suppose 1
I 1
shall 1
ever 1
see 1
this 1
horrid 1
London 1
again 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
My 1
son 1
don 1
t 1
say 1
such 1
dreadful 1
things 1
murmured 1
Mrs 1
Vane 1
taking 1
up 1
a 1
tawdry 1
theatrical 1
dress 1
with 1
a 1
sigh 1
and 1
beginning 1
to 1
patch 1
it 1
She 1
felt 1
a 1
little 1
disappointed 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
joined 1
the 1
group 1
It 1
would 1
have 1
increased 1
the 1
theatrical 1
picturesqueness 1
of 1
the 1
situation 1
Why 1
not 1
Mother 1
I 1
mean 1
it 1
You 1
pain 1
me 1
my 1
son 1
I 1
trust 1
you 1
will 1
return 1
from 1
Australia 1
in 1
a 1
position 1
of 1
affluence 1
I 1
believe 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
society 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
in 1
the 1
Colonies 1
nothing 1
that 1
I 1
would 1
call 1
society 1
so 1
when 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
your 1
fortune 1
you 1
must 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
assert 1
yourself 1
in 1
London 1
Society 1
muttered 1
the 1
lad 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
know 1
anything 1
about 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
make 1
some 1
money 1
to 1
take 1
you 1
and 1
Sibyl 1
off 1
the 1
stage 1
I 1
hate 1
it 1
Oh 1
Jim 1
said 1
Sibyl 1
laughing 1
how 1
unkind 1
of 1
you 1
But 1
are 1
you 1
really 1
going 1
for 1
a 1
walk 1
with 1
me 1
That 1
will 1
be 1
nice 1
I 1
was 1
afraid 1
you 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
say 1
good 1
bye 1
to 1
some 1
of 1
your 1
friends 1
to 1
Tom 1
Hardy 1
who 1
gave 1
you 1
that 1
hideous 1
pipe 1
or 1
Ned 1
Langton 1
who 1
makes 1
fun 1
of 1
you 1
for 1
smoking 1
it 1
It 1
is 1
very 1
sweet 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
your 1
last 1
afternoon 1
Where 1
shall 1
we 1
go 1
Let 1
us 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
park 1
I 1
am 1
too 1
shabby 1
he 1
answered 1
frowning 1
Only 1
swell 1
people 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
park 1
Nonsense 1
Jim 1
she 1
whispered 1
stroking 1
the 1
sleeve 1
of 1
his 1
coat 1
He 1
hesitated 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
Very 1
well 1
he 1
said 1
at 1
last 1
but 1
don 1
t 1
be 1
too 1
long 1
dressing 1
She 1
danced 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
One 1
could 1
hear 1
her 1
singing 1
as 1
she 1
ran 1
upstairs 1
Her 1
little 1
feet 1
pattered 1
overhead 1
He 1
walked 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
times 1
Then 1
he 1
turned 1
to 1
the 1
still 1
figure 1
in 1
the 1
chair 1
Mother 1
are 1
my 1
things 1
ready 1
he 1
asked 1
Quite 1
ready 1
James 1
she 1
answered 1
keeping 1
her 1
eyes 1
on 1
her 1
work 1
For 1
some 1
months 1
past 1
she 1
had 1
felt 1
ill 1
at 1
ease 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
alone 1
with 1
this 1
rough 1
stern 1
son 1
of 1
hers 1
Her 1
shallow 1
secret 1
nature 1
was 1
troubled 1
when 1
their 1
eyes 1
met 1
She 1
used 1
to 1
wonder 1
if 1
he 1
suspected 1
anything 1
The 1
silence 1
for 1
he 1
made 1
no 1
other 1
observation 1
became 1
intolerable 1
to 1
her 1
She 1
began 1
to 1
complain 1
Women 1
defend 1
themselves 1
by 1
attacking 1
just 1
as 1
they 1
attack 1
by 1
sudden 1
and 1
strange 1
surrenders 1
I 1
hope 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
contented 1
James 1
with 1
your 1
sea 1
faring 1
life 1
she 1
said 1
You 1
must 1
remember 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
your 1
own 1
choice 1
You 1
might 1
have 1
entered 1
a 1
solicitor 1
s 1
office 1
Solicitors 1
are 1
a 1
very 1
respectable 1
class 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
often 1
dine 1
with 1
the 1
best 1
families 1
I 1
hate 1
offices 1
and 1
I 1
hate 1
clerks 1
he 1
replied 1
But 1
you 1
are 1
quite 1
right 1
I 1
have 1
chosen 1
my 1
own 1
life 1
All 1
I 1
say 1
is 1
watch 1
over 1
Sibyl 1
Don 1
t 1
let 1
her 1
come 1
to 1
any 1
harm 1
Mother 1
you 1
must 1
watch 1
over 1
her 1
James 1
you 1
really 1
talk 1
very 1
strangely 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
watch 1
over 1
Sibyl 1
I 1
hear 1
a 1
gentleman 1
comes 1
every 1
night 1
to 1
the 1
theatre 1
and 1
goes 1
behind 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
her 1
Is 1
that 1
right 1
What 1
about 1
that 1
You 1
are 1
speaking 1
about 1
things 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
understand 1
James 1
In 1
the 1
profession 1
we 1
are 1
accustomed 1
to 1
receive 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
most 1
gratifying 1
attention 1
I 1
myself 1
used 1
to 1
receive 1
many 1
bouquets 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
That 1
was 1
when 1
acting 1
was 1
really 1
understood 1
As 1
for 1
Sibyl 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
at 1
present 1
whether 1
her 1
attachment 1
is 1
serious 1
or 1
not 1
But 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
in 1
question 1
is 1
a 1
perfect 1
gentleman 1
He 1
is 1
always 1
most 1
polite 1
to 1
me 1
Besides 1
he 1
has 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
being 1
rich 1
and 1
the 1
flowers 1
he 1
sends 1
are 1
lovely 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
his 1
name 1
though 1
said 1
the 1
lad 1
harshly 1
No 1
answered 1
his 1
mother 1
with 1
a 1
placid 1
expression 1
in 1
her 1
face 1
He 1
has 1
not 1
yet 1
revealed 1
his 1
real 1
name 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
romantic 1
of 1
him 1
He 1
is 1
probably 1
a 1
member 1
of 1
the 1
aristocracy 1
James 1
Vane 1
bit 1
his 1
lip 1
Watch 1
over 1
Sibyl 1
Mother 1
he 1
cried 1
watch 1
over 1
her 1
My 1
son 1
you 1
distress 1
me 1
very 1
much 1
Sibyl 1
is 1
always 1
under 1
my 1
special 1
care 1
Of 1
course 1
if 1
this 1
gentleman 1
is 1
wealthy 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
reason 1
why 1
she 1
should 1
not 1
contract 1
an 1
alliance 1
with 1
him 1
I 1
trust 1
he 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
aristocracy 1
He 1
has 1
all 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
it 1
I 1
must 1
say 1
It 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
most 1
brilliant 1
marriage 1
for 1
Sibyl 1
They 1
would 1
make 1
a 1
charming 1
couple 1
His 1
good 1
looks 1
are 1
really 1
quite 1
remarkable 1
everybody 1
notices 1
them 1
The 1
lad 1
muttered 1
something 1
to 1
himself 1
and 1
drummed 1
on 1
the 1
window 1
pane 1
with 1
his 1
coarse 1
fingers 1
He 1
had 1
just 1
turned 1
round 1
to 1
say 1
something 1
when 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
Sibyl 1
ran 1
in 1
How 1
serious 1
you 1
both 1
are 1
she 1
cried 1
What 1
is 1
the 1
matter 1
Nothing 1
he 1
answered 1
I 1
suppose 1
one 1
must 1
be 1
serious 1
sometimes 1
Good 1
bye 1
Mother 1
I 1
will 1
have 1
my 1
dinner 1
at 1
five 1
o 1
clock 1
Everything 1
is 1
packed 1
except 1
my 1
shirts 1
so 1
you 1
need 1
not 1
trouble 1
Good 1
bye 1
my 1
son 1
she 1
answered 1
with 1
a 1
bow 1
of 1
strained 1
stateliness 1
She 1
was 1
extremely 1
annoyed 1
at 1
the 1
tone 1
he 1
had 1
adopted 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
his 1
look 1
that 1
had 1
made 1
her 1
feel 1
afraid 1
Kiss 1
me 1
Mother 1
said 1
the 1
girl 1
Her 1
flowerlike 1
lips 1
touched 1
the 1
withered 1
cheek 1
and 1
warmed 1
its 1
frost 1
My 1
child 1
my 1
child 1
cried 1
Mrs 1
Vane 1
looking 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
ceiling 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
an 1
imaginary 1
gallery 1
Come 1
Sibyl 1
said 1
her 1
brother 1
impatiently 1
He 1
hated 1
his 1
mother 1
s 1
affectations 1
They 1
went 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
flickering 1
wind 1
blown 1
sunlight 1
and 1
strolled 1
down 1
the 1
dreary 1
Euston 1
Road 1
The 1
passersby 1
glanced 1
in 1
wonder 1
at 1
the 1
sullen 1
heavy 1
youth 1
who 1
in 1
coarse 1
ill 1
fitting 1
clothes 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
graceful 1
refined 1
looking 1
girl 1
He 1
was 1
like 1
a 1
common 1
gardener 1
walking 1
with 1
a 1
rose 1
Jim 1
frowned 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
when 1
he 1
caught 1
the 1
inquisitive 1
glance 1
of 1
some 1
stranger 1
He 1
had 1
that 1
dislike 1
of 1
being 1
stared 1
at 1
which 1
comes 1
on 1
geniuses 1
late 1
in 1
life 1
and 1
never 1
leaves 1
the 1
commonplace 1
Sibyl 1
however 1
was 1
quite 1
unconscious 1
of 1
the 1
effect 1
she 1
was 1
producing 1
Her 1
love 1
was 1
trembling 1
in 1
laughter 1
on 1
her 1
lips 1
She 1
was 1
thinking 1
of 1
Prince 1
Charming 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
think 1
of 1
him 1
all 1
the 1
more 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
talk 1
of 1
him 1
but 1
prattled 1
on 1
about 1
the 1
ship 1
in 1
which 1
Jim 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
sail 1
about 1
the 1
gold 1
he 1
was 1
certain 1
to 1
find 1
about 1
the 1
wonderful 1
heiress 1
whose 1
life 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
save 1
from 1
the 1
wicked 1
red 1
shirted 1
bushrangers 1
For 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
remain 1
a 1
sailor 1
or 1
a 1
supercargo 1
or 1
whatever 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
Oh 1
no 1
A 1
sailor 1
s 1
existence 1
was 1
dreadful 1
Fancy 1
being 1
cooped 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
horrid 1
ship 1
with 1
the 1
hoarse 1
hump 1
backed 1
waves 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
in 1
and 1
a 1
black 1
wind 1
blowing 1
the 1
masts 1
down 1
and 1
tearing 1
the 1
sails 1
into 1
long 1
screaming 1
ribands 1
He 1
was 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
vessel 1
at 1
Melbourne 1
bid 1
a 1
polite 1
good 1
bye 1
to 1
the 1
captain 1
and 1
go 1
off 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
the 1
gold 1
fields 1
Before 1
a 1
week 1
was 1
over 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
come 1
across 1
a 1
large 1
nugget 1
of 1
pure 1
gold 1
the 1
largest 1
nugget 1
that 1
had 1
ever 1
been 1
discovered 1
and 1
bring 1
it 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
coast 1
in 1
a 1
waggon 1
guarded 1
by 1
six 1
mounted 1
policemen 1
The 1
bushrangers 1
were 1
to 1
attack 1
them 1
three 1
times 1
and 1
be 1
defeated 1
with 1
immense 1
slaughter 1
Or 1
no 1
He 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
gold 1
fields 1
at 1
all 1
They 1
were 1
horrid 1
places 1
where 1
men 1
got 1
intoxicated 1
and 1
shot 1
each 1
other 1
in 1
bar 1
rooms 1
and 1
used 1
bad 1
language 1
He 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
nice 1
sheep 1
farmer 1
and 1
one 1
evening 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
riding 1
home 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
beautiful 1
heiress 1
being 1
carried 1
off 1
by 1
a 1
robber 1
on 1
a 1
black 1
horse 1
and 1
give 1
chase 1
and 1
rescue 1
her 1
Of 1
course 1
she 1
would 1
fall 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
they 1
would 1
get 1
married 1
and 1
come 1
home 1
and 1
live 1
in 1
an 1
immense 1
house 1
in 1
London 1
Yes 1
there 1
were 1
delightful 1
things 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
him 1
But 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
very 1
good 1
and 1
not 1
lose 1
his 1
temper 1
or 1
spend 1
his 1
money 1
foolishly 1
She 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
year 1
older 1
than 1
he 1
was 1
but 1
she 1
knew 1
so 1
much 1
more 1
of 1
life 1
He 1
must 1
be 1
sure 1
also 1
to 1
write 1
to 1
her 1
by 1
every 1
mail 1
and 1
to 1
say 1
his 1
prayers 1
each 1
night 1
before 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
sleep 1
God 1
was 1
very 1
good 1
and 1
would 1
watch 1
over 1
him 1
She 1
would 1
pray 1
for 1
him 1
too 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
years 1
he 1
would 1
come 1
back 1
quite 1
rich 1
and 1
happy 1
The 1
lad 1
listened 1
sulkily 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
made 1
no 1
answer 1
He 1
was 1
heart 1
sick 1
at 1
leaving 1
home 1
Yet 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
this 1
alone 1
that 1
made 1
him 1
gloomy 1
and 1
morose 1
Inexperienced 1
though 1
he 1
was 1
he 1
had 1
still 1
a 1
strong 1
sense 1
of 1
the 1
danger 1
of 1
Sibyl 1
s 1
position 1
This 1
young 1
dandy 1
who 1
was 1
making 1
love 1
to 1
her 1
could 1
mean 1
her 1
no 1
good 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
gentleman 1
and 1
he 1
hated 1
him 1
for 1
that 1
hated 1
him 1
through 1
some 1
curious 1
race 1
instinct 1
for 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
account 1
and 1
which 1
for 1
that 1
reason 1
was 1
all 1
the 1
more 1
dominant 1
within 1
him 1
He 1
was 1
conscious 1
also 1
of 1
the 1
shallowness 1
and 1
vanity 1
of 1
his 1
mother 1
s 1
nature 1
and 1
in 1
that 1
saw 1
infinite 1
peril 1
for 1
Sibyl 1
and 1
Sibyl 1
s 1
happiness 1
Children 1
begin 1
by 1
loving 1
their 1
parents 1
as 1
they 1
grow 1
older 1
they 1
judge 1
them 1
sometimes 1
they 1
forgive 1
them 1
His 1
mother 1
He 1
had 1
something 1
on 1
his 1
mind 1
to 1
ask 1
of 1
her 1
something 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
brooded 1
on 1
for 1
many 1
months 1
of 1
silence 1
A 1
chance 1
phrase 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
at 1
the 1
theatre 1
a 1
whispered 1
sneer 1
that 1
had 1
reached 1
his 1
ears 1
one 1
night 1
as 1
he 1
waited 1
at 1
the 1
stage 1
door 1
had 1
set 1
loose 1
a 1
train 1
of 1
horrible 1
thoughts 1
He 1
remembered 1
it 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
lash 1
of 1
a 1
hunting 1
crop 1
across 1
his 1
face 1
His 1
brows 1
knit 1
together 1
into 1
a 1
wedge 1
like 1
furrow 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
twitch 1
of 1
pain 1
he 1
bit 1
his 1
underlip 1
You 1
are 1
not 1
listening 1
to 1
a 1
word 1
I 1
am 1
saying 1
Jim 1
cried 1
Sibyl 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
making 1
the 1
most 1
delightful 1
plans 1
for 1
your 1
future 1
Do 1
say 1
something 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
me 1
to 1
say 1
Oh 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
good 1
boy 1
and 1
not 1
forget 1
us 1
she 1
answered 1
smiling 1
at 1
him 1
He 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
You 1
are 1
more 1
likely 1
to 1
forget 1
me 1
than 1
I 1
am 1
to 1
forget 1
you 1
Sibyl 1
She 1
flushed 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
Jim 1
she 1
asked 1
You 1
have 1
a 1
new 1
friend 1
I 1
hear 1
Who 1
is 1
he 1
Why 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
told 1
me 1
about 1
him 1
He 1
means 1
you 1
no 1
good 1
Stop 1
Jim 1
she 1
exclaimed 1
You 1
must 1
not 1
say 1
anything 1
against 1
him 1
I 1
love 1
him 1
Why 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
even 1
know 1
his 1
name 1
answered 1
the 1
lad 1
Who 1
is 1
he 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
know 1
He 1
is 1
called 1
Prince 1
Charming 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
like 1
the 1
name 1
Oh 1
you 1
silly 1
boy 1
you 1
should 1
never 1
forget 1
it 1
If 1
you 1
only 1
saw 1
him 1
you 1
would 1
think 1
him 1
the 1
most 1
wonderful 1
person 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
Some 1
day 1
you 1
will 1
meet 1
him 1
when 1
you 1
come 1
back 1
from 1
Australia 1
You 1
will 1
like 1
him 1
so 1
much 1
Everybody 1
likes 1
him 1
and 1
I 1
love 1
him 1
I 1
wish 1
you 1
could 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
theatre 1
to 1
night 1
He 1
is 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
there 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
to 1
play 1
Juliet 1
Oh 1
how 1
I 1
shall 1
play 1
it 1
Fancy 1
Jim 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
love 1
and 1
play 1
Juliet 1
To 1
have 1
him 1
sitting 1
there 1
To 1
play 1
for 1
his 1
delight 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
I 1
may 1
frighten 1
the 1
company 1
frighten 1
or 1
enthrall 1
them 1
To 1
be 1
in 1
love 1
is 1
to 1
surpass 1
one 1
s 1
self 1
Poor 1
dreadful 1
Mr 1
Isaacs 1
will 1
be 1
shouting 1
genius 1
to 1
his 1
loafers 1
at 1
the 1
bar 1
He 1
has 1
preached 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
dogma 1
to 1
night 1
he 1
will 1
announce 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
revelation 1
I 1
feel 1
it 1
And 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
his 2
only 1
Prince 1
Charming 1
my 1
wonderful 1
lover 1
my 1
god 1
of 1
graces 1
But 1
I 1
am 1
poor 1
beside 1
him 1
Poor 1
What 1
does 1
that 1
matter 1
When 1
poverty 1
creeps 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
love 1
flies 1
in 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
Our 1
proverbs 1
want 1
rewriting 1
They 1
were 1
made 1
in 1
winter 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
summer 1
now 1
spring 1
time 1
for 1
me 1
I 1
think 1
a 1
very 1
dance 1
of 1
blossoms 1
in 1
blue 1
skies 1
He 1
is 1
a 1
gentleman 1
said 1
the 1
lad 1
sullenly 1
A 1
prince 1
she 1
cried 1
musically 1
What 1
more 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
He 1
wants 1
to 1
enslave 1
you 1
I 1
shudder 1
at 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
being 1
free 1
I 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
beware 1
of 1
him 1
To 1
see 1
him 1
is 1
to 1
worship 1
him 1
to 1
know 1
him 1
is 1
to 1
trust 1
him 1
Sibyl 1
you 1
are 1
mad 1
about 1
him 1
She 1
laughed 1
and 1
took 1
his 1
arm 1
You 1
dear 1
old 1
Jim 1
you 1
talk 1
as 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
a 1
hundred 1
Some 1
day 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
in 1
love 1
yourself 1
Then 1
you 1
will 1
know 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
Don 1
t 1
look 1
so 1
sulky 1
Surely 1
you 1
should 1
be 1
glad 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
though 1
you 1
are 1
going 1
away 1
you 1
leave 1
me 1
happier 1
than 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
been 1
before 1
Life 1
has 1
been 1
hard 1
for 1
us 1
both 1
terribly 1
hard 1
and 1
difficult 1
But 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
different 1
now 1
You 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
a 1
new 1
world 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
found 1
one 1
Here 1
are 1
two 1
chairs 1
let 1
us 1
sit 1
down 1
and 1
see 1
the 1
smart 1
people 1
go 1
by 1
They 1
took 1
their 1
seats 1
amidst 1
a 1
crowd 1
of 1
watchers 1
The 1
tulip 1
beds 1
across 1
the 1
road 1
flamed 1
like 1
throbbing 1
rings 1
of 1
fire 1
A 1
white 1
dust 1
tremulous 1
cloud 1
of 1
orris 1
root 1
it 1
seemed 1
hung 1
in 1
the 1
panting 1
air 1
The 1
brightly 1
coloured 1
parasols 1
danced 1
and 1
dipped 1
like 1
monstrous 1
butterflies 1
She 1
made 1
her 1
brother 1
talk 1
of 1
himself 1
his 1
hopes 1
his 1
prospects 1
He 1
spoke 1
slowly 1
and 1
with 1
effort 1
They 1
passed 1
words 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
as 1
players 1
at 1
a 1
game 1
pass 1
counters 1
Sibyl 1
felt 1
oppressed 1
She 1
could 1
not 1
communicate 1
her 1
joy 1
A 1
faint 1
smile 1
curving 1
that 1
sullen 1
mouth 1
was 1
all 1
the 1
echo 1
she 1
could 1
win 1
After 1
some 1
time 1
she 1
became 1
silent 1
Suddenly 1
she 1
caught 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
golden 1
hair 1
and 1
laughing 1
lips 1
and 1
in 1
an 1
open 1
carriage 1
with 1
two 1
ladies 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
drove 1
past 1
She 1
started 1
to 1
her 1
feet 1
There 1
he 1
is 1
she 1
cried 1
Who 1
said 1
Jim 1
Vane 1
Prince 1
Charming 1
she 1
answered 1
looking 1
after 1
the 1
victoria 1
He 1
jumped 1
up 1
and 1
seized 1
her 1
roughly 1
by 1
the 1
arm 1
Show 1
him 1
to 1
me 1
Which 1
is 1
he 1
Point 1
him 1
out 1
I 1
must 1
see 1
him 1
he 1
exclaimed 1
but 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
the 1
Duke 1
of 1
Berwick 1
s 1
four 1
in 1
hand 1
came 1
between 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
had 1
left 1
the 1
space 1
clear 1
the 1
carriage 1
had 1
swept 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
park 1
He 1
is 1
gone 1
murmured 1
Sibyl 1
sadly 1
I 1
wish 1
you 1
had 1
seen 1
him 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
had 1
for 1
as 1
sure 1
as 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
God 1
in 1
heaven 1
if 1
he 1
ever 1
does 1
you 1
any 1
wrong 1
I 1
shall 1
kill 1
him 1
She 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
in 1
horror 1
He 1
repeated 1
his 1
words 1
They 1
cut 1
the 1
air 1
like 1
a 1
dagger 1
The 1
people 1
round 1
began 1
to 1
gape 1
A 1
lady 1
standing 1
close 1
to 1
her 1
tittered 1
Come 1
away 1
Jim 1
come 1
away 1
she 1
whispered 1
He 1
followed 1
her 1
doggedly 1
as 1
she 1
passed 1
through 1
the 1
crowd 1
He 1
felt 1
glad 1
at 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
said 1
When 1
they 1
reached 1
the 1
Achilles 1
Statue 1
she 1
turned 1
round 1
There 1
was 1
pity 1
in 1
her 1
eyes 1
that 1
became 1
laughter 1
on 1
her 1
lips 1
She 1
shook 1
her 1
head 1
at 1
him 1
You 1
are 1
foolish 1
Jim 1
utterly 1
foolish 1
a 1
bad 1
tempered 1
boy 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
How 1
can 1
you 1
say 1
such 1
horrible 1
things 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
you 1
are 1
talking 1
about 1
You 1
are 1
simply 1
jealous 1
and 1
unkind 1
Ah 1
I 1
wish 1
you 1
would 1
fall 1
in 1
love 1
Love 1
makes 1
people 1
good 1
and 1
what 1
you 1
said 1
was 1
wicked 1
I 1
am 1
sixteen 1
he 1
answered 1
and 1
I 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
am 1
about 1
Mother 1
is 1
no 1
help 1
to 1
you 1
She 1
doesn 1
t 1
understand 1
how 1
to 1
look 1
after 1
you 1
I 1
wish 1
now 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
Australia 1
at 1
all 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
great 1
mind 1
to 1
chuck 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
up 1
I 1
would 1
if 1
my 1
articles 1
hadn 1
t 1
been 1
signed 1
Oh 1
don 1
t 1
be 1
so 1
serious 1
Jim 1
You 1
are 1
like 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
heroes 1
of 1
those 1
silly 1
melodramas 1
Mother 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
fond 1
of 1
acting 1
in 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
quarrel 1
with 1
you 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
him 1
and 1
oh 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
is 1
perfect 1
happiness 1
We 1
won 1
t 1
quarrel 1
I 1
know 1
you 1
would 1
never 1
harm 1
any 1
one 1
I 1
love 1
would 1
you 1
Not 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
you 1
love 1
him 1
I 1
suppose 1
was 1
the 1
sullen 1
answer 1
I 1
shall 1
love 1
him 1
for 1
ever 1
she 1
cried 1
And 1
he 1
For 1
ever 1
too 1
He 1
had 1
better 1
She 1
shrank 1
from 1
him 1
Then 1
she 1
laughed 1
and 1
put 1
her 1
hand 1
on 1
his 1
arm 1
He 1
was 1
merely 1
a 1
boy 1
At 1
the 1
Marble 1
Arch 1
they 1
hailed 1
an 1
omnibus 1
which 1
left 1
them 1
close 1
to 1
their 1
shabby 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
Euston 1
Road 1
It 1
was 1
after 1
five 1
o 1
clock 1
and 1
Sibyl 1
had 1
to 1
lie 1
down 1
for 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
hours 1
before 1
acting 1
Jim 1
insisted 1
that 1
she 1
should 1
do 1
so 1
He 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
sooner 1
part 1
with 1
her 1
when 1
their 1
mother 1
was 1
not 1
present 1
She 1
would 1
be 1
sure 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
scene 1
and 1
he 1
detested 1
scenes 1
of 1
every 1
kind 1
In 1
Sybil 1
s 1
own 1
room 1
they 1
parted 1
There 1
was 1
jealousy 1
in 1
the 1
lad 1
s 1
heart 1
and 1
a 1
fierce 1
murderous 1
hatred 1
of 1
the 1
stranger 1
who 1
as 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
had 1
come 1
between 1
them 1
Yet 1
when 1
her 1
arms 1
were 1
flung 1
round 1
his 1
neck 1
and 1
her 1
fingers 1
strayed 1
through 1
his 1
hair 1
he 1
softened 1
and 1
kissed 1
her 1
with 1
real 1
affection 1
There 1
were 1
tears 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
downstairs 1
His 1
mother 1
was 1
waiting 1
for 1
him 1
below 1
She 1
grumbled 1
at 1
his 1
unpunctuality 1
as 1
he 1
entered 1
He 1
made 1
no 1
answer 1
but 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
his 1
meagre 1
meal 1
The 1
flies 1
buzzed 1
round 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
crawled 1
over 1
the 1
stained 1
cloth 1
Through 1
the 1
rumble 1
of 1
omnibuses 1
and 1
the 1
clatter 1
of 1
street 1
cabs 1
he 1
could 1
hear 1
the 1
droning 1
voice 1
devouring 1
each 1
minute 1
that 1
was 1
left 1
to 1
him 1
After 1
some 1
time 1
he 1
thrust 1
away 1
his 1
plate 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
head 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
He 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
know 1
It 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
told 1
to 1
him 1
before 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
he 1
suspected 1
Leaden 1
with 1
fear 1
his 1
mother 1
watched 1
him 1
Words 1
dropped 1
mechanically 1
from 1
her 1
lips 1
A 1
tattered 1
lace 1
handkerchief 1
twitched 1
in 1
her 1
fingers 1
When 1
the 1
clock 1
struck 1
six 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
Then 1
he 1
turned 1
back 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
her 1
Their 1
eyes 1
met 1
In 1
hers 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
wild 1
appeal 1
for 1
mercy 1
It 1
enraged 1
him 1
Mother 1
I 1
have 1
something 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
he 1
said 1
Her 1
eyes 1
wandered 1
vaguely 1
about 1
the 1
room 1
She 1
made 1
no 1
answer 1
Tell 1
me 1
the 1
truth 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
know 1
Were 1
you 1
married 1
to 1
my 1
father 1
She 1
heaved 1
a 1
deep 1
sigh 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
sigh 1
of 1
relief 1
The 1
terrible 1
moment 1
the 1
moment 1
that 1
night 1
and 1
day 1
for 1
weeks 1
and 1
months 1
she 1
had 1
dreaded 1
had 1
come 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
yet 1
she 1
felt 1
no 1
terror 1
Indeed 1
in 1
some 1
measure 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
disappointment 1
to 1
her 1
The 1
vulgar 1
directness 1
of 1
the 1
question 1
called 1
for 1
a 1
direct 1
answer 1
The 1
situation 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
gradually 1
led 1
up 1
to 1
It 1
was 1
crude 1
It 1
reminded 1
her 1
of 1
a 1
bad 1
rehearsal 1
No 1
she 1
answered 1
wondering 1
at 1
the 1
harsh 1
simplicity 1
of 1
life 1
My 1
father 1
was 1
a 1
scoundrel 1
then 1
cried 1
the 1
lad 1
clenching 1
his 1
fists 1
She 1
shook 1
her 1
head 1
I 1
knew 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
free 1
We 1
loved 1
each 1
other 1
very 1
much 1
If 1
he 1
had 1
lived 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
made 1
provision 1
for 1
us 1
Don 1
t 1
speak 1
against 1
him 1
my 1
son 1
He 1
was 1
your 1
father 1
and 1
a 1
gentleman 1
Indeed 1
he 1
was 1
highly 1
connected 1
An 1
oath 1
broke 1
from 1
his 1
lips 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
for 1
myself 1
he 1
exclaimed 1
but 1
don 1
t 1
let 1
Sibyl 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
gentleman 1
isn 1
t 1
it 1
who 1
is 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
her 1
or 1
says 1
he 1
is 1
Highly 1
connected 1
too 1
I 1
suppose 1
For 1
a 1
moment 1
a 1
hideous 1
sense 1
of 1
humiliation 1
came 1
over 1
the 1
woman 1
Her 1
head 1
drooped 1
She 1
wiped 1
her 1
eyes 1
with 1
shaking 1
hands 1
Sibyl 1
has 1
a 1
mother 1
she 1
murmured 1
I 1
had 1
none 1
The 1
lad 1
was 1
touched 1
He 1
went 1
towards 1
her 1
and 1
stooping 1
down 1
he 1
kissed 1
her 1
I 1
am 1
sorry 1
if 1
I 1
have 1
pained 1
you 1
by 1
asking 1
about 1
my 1
father 1
he 1
said 1
but 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
it 1
I 1
must 1
go 1
now 1
Good 1
bye 1
Don 1
t 1
forget 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
only 1
one 1
child 1
now 1
to 1
look 1
after 1
and 1
believe 1
me 1
that 1
if 1
this 1
man 1
wrongs 1
my 1
sister 1
I 1
will 1
find 1
out 1
who 1
he 1
is 1
track 1
him 1
down 1
and 1
kill 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
dog 1
I 1
swear 1
it 1
The 1
exaggerated 1
folly 1
of 1
the 1
threat 1
the 1
passionate 1
gesture 1
that 1
accompanied 1
it 1
the 1
mad 1
melodramatic 1
words 1
made 1
life 1
seem 1
more 1
vivid 1
to 1
her 1
She 1
was 1
familiar 1
with 1
the 1
atmosphere 1
She 1
breathed 1
more 1
freely 1
and 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
for 1
many 1
months 1
she 1
really 1
admired 1
her 1
son 1
She 1
would 1
have 1
liked 1
to 1
have 1
continued 1
the 1
scene 1
on 1
the 1
same 1
emotional 1
scale 1
but 1
he 1
cut 1
her 1
short 1
Trunks 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
carried 1
down 1
and 1
mufflers 1
looked 1
for 1
The 1
lodging 1
house 1
drudge 1
bustled 1
in 1
and 1
out 1
There 1
was 1
the 1
bargaining 1
with 1
the 1
cabman 1
The 1
moment 1
was 1
lost 1
in 1
vulgar 1
details 1
It 1
was 1
with 1
a 1
renewed 1
feeling 1
of 1
disappointment 1
that 1
she 1
waved 1
the 1
tattered 1
lace 1
handkerchief 1
from 1
the 1
window 1
as 1
her 1
son 1
drove 1
away 1
She 1
was 1
conscious 1
that 1
a 1
great 1
opportunity 1
had 1
been 1
wasted 1
She 1
consoled 1
herself 1
by 1
telling 1
Sibyl 1
how 1
desolate 1
she 1
felt 1
her 1
life 1
would 1
be 1
now 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
only 1
one 1
child 1
to 1
look 1
after 1
She 1
remembered 1
the 1
phrase 1
It 1
had 1
pleased 1
her 1
Of 1
the 1
threat 1
she 1
said 1
nothing 1
It 1
was 1
vividly 1
and 1
dramatically 1
expressed 1
She 1
felt 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
all 1
laugh 1
at 1
it 1
some 1
day 1
CHAPTER 1
I 1
suppose 1
you 1
have 1
heard 1
the 1
news 1
Basil 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
that 1
evening 1
as 1
Hallward 1
was 1
shown 1
into 1
a 1
little 1
private 1
room 1
at 1
the 1
Bristol 1
where 1
dinner 1
had 1
been 1
laid 1
for 1
three 1
No 1
Harry 1
answered 1
the 1
artist 1
giving 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
coat 1
to 1
the 1
bowing 1
waiter 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
Nothing 1
about 1
politics 1
I 1
hope 1
They 1
don 1
t 1
interest 1
me 1
There 1
is 1
hardly 1
a 1
single 1
person 1
in 1
the 1
House 1
of 1
Commons 1
worth 1
painting 1
though 1
many 1
of 1
them 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
better 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
whitewashing 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
is 1
engaged 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
watching 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
Hallward 1
started 1
and 1
then 1
frowned 1
Dorian 1
engaged 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
he 1
cried 1
Impossible 1
It 1
is 1
perfectly 1
true 1
To 1
whom 1
To 1
some 1
little 1
actress 1
or 1
other 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
believe 1
it 1
Dorian 1
is 1
far 1
too 1
sensible 1
Dorian 1
is 1
far 1
too 1
wise 1
not 1
to 1
do 1
foolish 1
things 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
my 1
dear 1
Basil 1
Marriage 1
is 1
hardly 1
a 1
thing 1
that 1
one 1
can 1
do 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
Harry 1
Except 1
in 1
America 1
rejoined 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
languidly 1
But 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
say 1
he 1
was 1
married 1
I 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
engaged 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
difference 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
distinct 1
remembrance 1
of 1
being 1
married 1
but 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
recollection 1
at 1
all 1
of 1
being 1
engaged 1
I 1
am 1
inclined 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
never 1
was 1
engaged 1
But 1
think 1
of 1
Dorian 1
s 1
birth 1
and 1
position 1
and 1
wealth 1
It 1
would 1
be 1
absurd 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
marry 1
so 1
much 1
beneath 1
him 1
If 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
make 1
him 1
marry 1
this 1
girl 1
tell 1
him 1
that 1
Basil 1
He 1
is 1
sure 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
then 1
Whenever 1
a 1
man 1
does 1
a 1
thoroughly 1
stupid 1
thing 1
it 1
is 1
always 1
from 1
the 1
noblest 1
motives 1
I 1
hope 1
the 1
girl 1
is 1
good 1
Harry 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
Dorian 1
tied 1
to 1
some 1
vile 1
creature 1
who 1
might 1
degrade 1
his 1
nature 1
and 1
ruin 1
his 1
intellect 1
Oh 1
she 1
is 1
better 1
than 1
good 1
she 1
is 1
beautiful 1
murmured 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
sipping 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
vermouth 1
and 1
orange 1
bitters 1
Dorian 1
says 1
she 1
is 1
beautiful 1
and 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
often 1
wrong 1
about 1
things 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
Your 1
portrait 1
of 1
him 1
has 1
quickened 1
his 1
appreciation 1
of 1
the 1
personal 1
appearance 1
of 1
other 1
people 1
It 1
has 1
had 1
that 1
excellent 1
effect 1
amongst 1
others 1
We 1
are 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
to 1
night 1
if 1
that 1
boy 1
doesn 1
t 1
forget 1
his 1
appointment 1
Are 1
you 1
serious 1
Quite 1
serious 1
Basil 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
miserable 1
if 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
should 1
ever 1
be 1
more 1
serious 1
than 1
I 1
am 1
at 1
the 1
present 1
moment 1
But 1
do 1
you 1
approve 1
of 1
it 1
Harry 1
asked 1
the 1
painter 1
walking 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
biting 1
his 1
lip 1
You 1
can 1
t 1
approve 1
of 1
it 1
possibly 1
It 1
is 1
some 1
silly 1
infatuation 1
I 1
never 1
approve 1
or 1
disapprove 1
of 1
anything 1
now 1
It 1
is 1
an 1
absurd 1
attitude 1
to 1
take 1
towards 1
life 1
We 1
are 1
not 1
sent 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
air 1
our 1
moral 1
prejudices 1
I 1
never 1
take 1
any 1
notice 1
of 1
what 1
common 1
people 1
say 1
and 1
I 1
never 1
interfere 1
with 1
what 1
charming 1
people 1
do 1
If 1
a 1
personality 1
fascinates 1
me 1
whatever 1
mode 1
of 1
expression 1
that 1
personality 1
selects 1
is 1
absolutely 1
delightful 1
to 1
me 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
falls 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
a 1
beautiful 1
girl 1
who 1
acts 1
Juliet 1
and 1
proposes 1
to 1
marry 1
her 1
Why 1
not 1
If 1
he 1
wedded 1
Messalina 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
none 1
the 1
less 1
interesting 1
You 1
know 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
a 1
champion 1
of 1
marriage 1
The 1
real 1
drawback 1
to 1
marriage 1
is 1
that 1
it 1
makes 1
one 1
unselfish 1
And 1
unselfish 1
people 1
are 1
colourless 1
They 1
lack 1
individuality 1
Still 1
there 1
are 1
certain 1
temperaments 1
that 1
marriage 1
makes 1
more 1
complex 1
They 1
retain 1
their 1
egotism 1
and 1
add 1
to 1
it 1
many 1
other 1
egos 1
They 1
are 1
forced 1
to 1
have 1
more 1
than 1
one 1
life 1
They 1
become 1
more 1
highly 1
organized 1
and 1
to 1
be 1
highly 1
organized 1
is 1
I 1
should 1
fancy 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
man 1
s 1
existence 1
Besides 1
every 1
experience 1
is 1
of 1
value 1
and 1
whatever 1
one 1
may 1
say 1
against 1
marriage 1
it 1
is 1
certainly 1
an 1
experience 1
I 1
hope 1
that 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
will 1
make 1
this 1
girl 1
his 1
wife 1
passionately 1
adore 1
her 1
for 1
six 1
months 1
and 1
then 1
suddenly 1
become 1
fascinated 1
by 1
some 1
one 1
else 1
He 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
wonderful 1
study 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
mean 1
a 1
single 1
word 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
Harry 1
you 1
know 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
If 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
s 1
life 1
were 1
spoiled 1
no 1
one 1
would 1
be 1
sorrier 1
than 1
yourself 1
You 1
are 1
much 1
better 1
than 1
you 1
pretend 1
to 1
be 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
laughed 1
The 1
reason 1
we 1
all 1
like 1
to 1
think 1
so 1
well 1
of 1
others 1
is 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
all 1
afraid 1
for 1
ourselves 1
The 1
basis 1
of 1
optimism 1
is 1
sheer 1
terror 1
We 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
generous 1
because 1
we 1
credit 1
our 1
neighbour 1
with 1
the 1
possession 1
of 1
those 1
virtues 1
that 1
are 1
likely 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
benefit 1
to 1
us 1
We 1
praise 1
the 1
banker 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
overdraw 1
our 1
account 1
and 1
find 1
good 1
qualities 1
in 1
the 1
highwayman 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
that 1
he 1
may 1
spare 1
our 1
pockets 1
I 1
mean 1
everything 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
said 1
I 1
have 1
the 1
greatest 1
contempt 1
for 1
optimism 1
As 1
for 1
a 1
spoiled 1
life 1
no 1
life 1
is 1
spoiled 1
but 1
one 1
whose 1
growth 1
is 1
arrested 1
If 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
mar 1
a 1
nature 1
you 1
have 1
merely 1
to 1
reform 1
it 1
As 1
for 1
marriage 1
of 1
course 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
silly 1
but 1
there 1
are 1
other 1
and 1
more 1
interesting 1
bonds 1
between 1
men 1
and 1
women 1
I 1
will 1
certainly 1
encourage 1
them 1
They 1
have 1
the 1
charm 1
of 1
being 1
fashionable 1
But 1
here 1
is 1
Dorian 1
himself 1
He 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
more 1
than 1
I 1
can 1
My 1
dear 1
Harry 1
my 1
dear 1
Basil 1
you 1
must 1
both 1
congratulate 1
me 1
said 1
the 1
lad 1
throwing 1
off 1
his 1
evening 1
cape 1
with 1
its 1
satin 1
lined 1
wings 1
and 1
shaking 1
each 1
of 1
his 1
friends 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
in 1
turn 1
I 1
have 1
never 1
been 1
so 1
happy 1
Of 1
course 1
it 1
is 1
sudden 1
all 1
really 1
delightful 1
things 1
are 1
And 1
yet 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
one 1
thing 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
looking 1
for 1
all 1
my 1
life 1
He 1
was 1
flushed 1
with 1
excitement 1
and 1
pleasure 1
and 1
looked 1
extraordinarily 1
handsome 1
I 1
hope 1
you 1
will 1
always 1
be 1
very 1
happy 1
Dorian 1
said 1
Hallward 1
but 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
quite 1
forgive 1
you 1
for 1
not 1
having 1
let 1
me 1
know 1
of 1
your 1
engagement 1
You 1
let 1
Harry 1
know 1
And 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
forgive 1
you 1
for 1
being 1
late 1
for 1
dinner 1
broke 1
in 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
putting 1
his 1
hand 1
on 1
the 1
lad 1
s 1
shoulder 1
and 1
smiling 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
Come 1
let 1
us 1
sit 1
down 1
and 1
try 1
what 1
the 1
new 1
chef 1
here 1
is 1
like 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
will 1
tell 1
us 1
how 1
it 1
all 1
came 1
about 1
There 1
is 1
really 1
not 1
much 1
to 1
tell 1
cried 1
Dorian 1
as 1
they 1
took 1
their 1
seats 1
at 1
the 1
small 1
round 1
table 1
What 1
happened 1
was 1
simply 1
this 1
After 1
I 1
left 1
you 1
yesterday 1
evening 1
Harry 1
I 1
dressed 1
had 1
some 1
dinner 1
at 1
that 1
little 1
Italian 1
restaurant 1
in 1
Rupert 1
Street 1
you 1
introduced 1
me 1
to 1
and 1
went 1
down 1
at 1
eight 1
o 1
clock 1
to 1
the 1
theatre 1
Sibyl 1
was 1
playing 1
Rosalind 1
Of 1
course 1
the 1
scenery 1
was 1
dreadful 1
and 1
the 1
Orlando 1
absurd 1
But 1
Sibyl 1
You 1
should 1
have 1
seen 1
her 1
When 1
she 1
came 1
on 1
in 1
her 1
boy 1
s 1
clothes 1
she 1
was 1
perfectly 1
wonderful 1
She 1
wore 1
a 1
moss 1
coloured 1
velvet 1
jerkin 1
with 1
cinnamon 1
sleeves 1
slim 1
brown 1
cross 1
gartered 1
hose 1
a 1
dainty 1
little 1
green 1
cap 1
with 1
a 1
hawk 1
s 1
feather 1
caught 1
in 1
a 1
jewel 1
and 1
a 1
hooded 1
cloak 1
lined 1
with 1
dull 1
red 1
She 1
had 1
never 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
more 1
exquisite 1
She 1
had 1
all 1
the 1
delicate 1
grace 1
of 1
that 1
Tanagra 1
figurine 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
in 1
your 1
studio 1
Basil 1
Her 1
hair 1
clustered 1
round 1
her 1
face 1
like 1
dark 1
leaves 1
round 1
a 1
pale 1
rose 1
As 1
for 1
her 1
acting 1
well 1
you 1
shall 1
see 1
her 1
to 1
night 1
She 1
is 1
simply 1
a 1
born 1
artist 1
I 1
sat 1
in 1
the 1
dingy 1
box 1
absolutely 1
enthralled 1
I 1
forgot 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
London 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
nineteenth 1
century 1
I 1
was 1
away 1
with 1
my 1
love 1
in 1
a 1
forest 1
that 1
no 1
man 1
had 1
ever 1
seen 1
After 1
the 1
performance 1
was 1
over 1
I 1
went 1
behind 1
and 1
spoke 1
to 1
her 1
As 1
we 1
were 1
sitting 1
together 1
suddenly 1
there 1
came 1
into 1
her 1
eyes 1
a 1
look 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
there 1
before 1
My 1
lips 1
moved 1
towards 1
hers 1
We 1
kissed 1
each 1
other 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
describe 1
to 1
you 1
what 1
I 1
felt 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
It 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
all 1
my 1
life 1
had 1
been 1
narrowed 1
to 1
one 1
perfect 1
point 1
of 1
rose 1
coloured 1
joy 1
She 1
trembled 1
all 1
over 1
and 1
shook 1
like 1
a 1
white 1
narcissus 1
Then 1
she 1
flung 1
herself 1
on 1
her 1
knees 1
and 1
kissed 1
my 1
hands 1
I 1
feel 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
tell 1
you 1
all 1
this 1
but 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
help 1
it 1
Of 1
course 1
our 1
engagement 1
is 1
a 1
dead 1
secret 1
She 1
has 1
not 1
even 1
told 1
her 1
own 1
mother 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
my 1
guardians 1
will 1
say 1
Lord 1
Radley 1
is 1
sure 1
to 1
be 1
furious 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
of 1
age 1
in 1
less 1
than 1
a 1
year 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
can 1
do 1
what 1
I 1
like 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
right 1
Basil 1
haven 1
t 1
I 1
to 1
take 1
my 1
love 1
out 1
of 1
poetry 1
and 1
to 1
find 1
my 1
wife 1
in 1
Shakespeare 1
s 1
plays 1
Lips 1
that 1
Shakespeare 1
taught 1
to 1
speak 1
have 1
whispered 1
their 1
secret 1
in 1
my 1
ear 1
I 1
have 1
had 1
the 1
arms 1
of 1
Rosalind 1
around 1
me 1
and 1
kissed 1
Juliet 1
on 1
the 1
mouth 1
Yes 1
Dorian 1
I 1
suppose 1
you 1
were 1
right 1
said 1
Hallward 1
slowly 1
Have 1
you 1
seen 1
her 1
to 1
day 1
asked 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
I 1
left 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
forest 1
of 1
Arden 1
I 1
shall 1
find 1
her 1
in 1
an 1
orchard 1
in 1
Verona 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
sipped 1
his 1
champagne 1
in 1
a 1
meditative 1
manner 1
At 1
what 1
particular 1
point 1
did 1
you 1
mention 1
the 1
word 1
marriage 1
Dorian 1
And 1
what 1
did 1
she 1
say 1
in 1
answer 1
Perhaps 1
you 1
forgot 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
My 1
dear 1
Harry 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
treat 1
it 1
as 1
a 1
business 1
transaction 1
and 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
make 1
any 1
formal 1
proposal 1
I 1
told 1
her 1
that 1
I 1
loved 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
worthy 1
to 1
be 1
my 1
wife 1
Not 1
worthy 1
Why 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
is 1
nothing 1
to 1
me 1
compared 1
with 1
her 1
Women 1
are 1
wonderfully 1
practical 1
murmured 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
much 1
more 1
practical 1
than 1
we 1
are 1
In 1
situations 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
we 1
often 1
forget 1
to 1
say 1
anything 1
about 1
marriage 1
and 1
they 1
always 1
remind 1
us 1
Hallward 1
laid 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
his 1
arm 1
Don 1
t 1
Harry 1
You 1
have 1
annoyed 1
Dorian 1
He 1
is 1
not 1
like 1
other 1
men 1
He 1
would 1
never 1
bring 1
misery 1
upon 1
any 1
one 1
His 1
nature 1
is 1
too 1
fine 1
for 1
that 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
looked 1
across 1
the 1
table 1
Dorian 1
is 1
never 1
annoyed 1
with 1
me 1
he 1
answered 1
I 1
asked 1
the 1
question 1
for 1
the 1
best 1
reason 1
possible 1
for 1
the 1
only 1
reason 1
indeed 1
that 1
excuses 1
one 1
for 1
asking 1
any 1
question 1
simple 1
curiosity 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
theory 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
always 1
the 1
women 1
who 1
propose 1
to 1
us 1
and 1
not 1
we 1
who 1
propose 1
to 1
the 1
women 1
Except 1
of 1
course 1
in 1
middle 1
class 1
life 1
But 1
then 1
the 1
middle 1
classes 1
are 1
not 1
modern 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
laughed 1
and 1
tossed 1
his 1
head 1
You 1
are 1
quite 1
incorrigible 1
Harry 1
but 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
mind 1
It 1
is 1
impossible 1
to 1
be 1
angry 1
with 1
you 1
When 1
you 1
see 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
you 1
will 1
feel 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
could 1
wrong 1
her 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
beast 1
a 1
beast 1
without 1
a 1
heart 1
I 1
cannot 1
understand 1
how 1
any 1
one 1
can 1
wish 1
to 1
shame 1
the 1
thing 1
he 1
loves 1
I 1
love 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
place 1
her 1
on 1
a 1
pedestal 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
world 1
worship 1

What 1
is 1
marriage 1
An 1
irrevocable 1
vow 1
You 1
mock 1
at 1
it 1
for 1
that 1
Ah 1
don 1
t 1
mock 1
It 1
is 1
an 1
irrevocable 1
vow 1
that 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
take 1
Her 1
trust 1
makes 1
me 1
faithful 1
her 1
belief 1
makes 1
me 1
good 1
When 1
I 1
am 1
with 1
her 1
I 1
regret 1
all 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
taught 1
me 1
I 1
become 1
different 1
from 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
known 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
I 1
am 1
changed 1
and 1
the 1
mere 1
touch 1
of 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
s 1
hand 1
makes 1
me 1
forget 1
you 1
and 1
all 1
your 1
wrong 1
fascinating 1
poisonous 1
delightful 1
theories 1
And 1
those 1
are 1
asked 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
helping 1
himself 1
to 1
some 1
salad 1
Oh 1
your 1
theories 1
about 1
life 1
your 1
theories 1
about 1
love 1
your 1
theories 1
about 1
pleasure 1
All 1
your 1
theories 1
in 1
fact 1
Harry 1
Pleasure 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
worth 1
having 1
a 1
theory 1
about 1
he 1
answered 1
in 1
his 1
slow 1
melodious 1
voice 1
But 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
I 1
cannot 1
claim 1
my 1
theory 1
as 1
my 1
own 1
It 1
belongs 1
to 1
Nature 1
not 1
to 1
me 1
Pleasure 1
is 1
Nature 1
s 1
test 1
her 1
sign 1
of 1
approval 1
When 1
we 1
are 1
happy 1
we 1
are 1
always 1
good 1
but 1
when 1
we 1
are 1
good 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
always 1
happy 1
Ah 1
but 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
by 1
good 1
cried 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
Yes 1
echoed 1
Dorian 1
leaning 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
looking 1
at 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
over 1
the 1
heavy 1
clusters 1
of 1
purple 1
lipped 1
irises 1
that 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
table 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
by 1
good 1
Harry 1
To 1
be 1
good 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
harmony 1
with 1
one 1
s 1
self 1
he 1
replied 1
touching 1
the 1
thin 1
stem 1
of 1
his 1
glass 1
with 1
his 1
pale 1
fine 1
pointed 1
fingers 1
Discord 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
forced 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
harmony 1
with 1
others 1
One 1
s 1
own 1
life 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
important 1
thing 1
As 1
for 1
the 1
lives 1
of 1
one 1
s 1
neighbours 1
if 1
one 1
wishes 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
prig 1
or 1
a 1
Puritan 1
one 1
can 1
flaunt 1
one 1
s 1
moral 1
views 1
about 1
them 1
but 1
they 1
are 1
not 1
one 1
s 1
concern 1
Besides 1
individualism 1
has 1
really 1
the 1
higher 1
aim 1
Modern 1
morality 1
consists 1
in 1
accepting 1
the 1
standard 1
of 1
one 1
s 1
age 1
I 1
consider 1
that 1
for 1
any 1
man 1
of 1
culture 1
to 1
accept 1
the 1
standard 1
of 1
his 1
age 1
is 1
a 1
form 1
of 1
the 1
grossest 1
immorality 1
But 1
surely 1
if 1
one 1
lives 1
merely 1
for 1
one 1
s 1
self 1
Harry 1
one 1
pays 1
a 1
terrible 1
price 1
for 1
doing 1
so 1
suggested 1
the 1
painter 1
Yes 1
we 1
are 1
overcharged 1
for 1
everything 1
nowadays 1
I 1
should 1
fancy 1
that 1
the 1
real 1
tragedy 1
of 1
the 1
poor 1
is 1
that 1
they 1
can 1
afford 1
nothing 1
but 1
self 1
denial 1
Beautiful 1
sins 1
like 1
beautiful 1
things 1
are 1
the 1
privilege 1
of 1
the 1
rich 1
One 1
has 1
to 1
pay 1
in 1
other 1
ways 1
but 1
money 1
What 1
sort 1
of 1
ways 1
Basil 1
Oh 1
I 1
should 1
fancy 1
in 1
remorse 1
in 1
suffering 1
in 1
well 1
in 1
the 1
consciousness 1
of 1
degradation 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
mediaeval 1
art 1
is 1
charming 1
but 1
mediaeval 1
emotions 1
are 1
out 1
of 1
date 1
One 1
can 1
use 1
them 1
in 1
fiction 1
of 1
course 1
But 1
then 1
the 1
only 1
things 1
that 1
one 1
can 1
use 1
in 1
fiction 1
are 1
the 1
things 1
that 1
one 1
has 1
ceased 1
to 1
use 1
in 1
fact 1
Believe 1
me 1
no 1
civilized 1
man 1
ever 1
regrets 1
a 1
pleasure 1
and 1
no 1
uncivilized 1
man 1
ever 1
knows 1
what 1
a 1
pleasure 1
is 1
I 1
know 1
what 1
pleasure 1
is 1
cried 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
It 1
is 1
to 1
adore 1
some 1
one 1
That 1
is 1
certainly 1
better 1
than 1
being 1
adored 1
he 1
answered 1
toying 1
with 1
some 1
fruits 1
Being 1
adored 1
is 1
a 1
nuisance 1
Women 1
treat 1
us 1
just 1
as 1
humanity 1
treats 1
its 1
gods 1
They 1
worship 1
us 1
and 1
are 1
always 1
bothering 1
us 1
to 1
do 1
something 1
for 1
them 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
said 1
that 1
whatever 1
they 1
ask 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
first 1
given 1
to 1
us 1
murmured 1
the 1
lad 1
gravely 1
They 1
create 1
love 1
in 1
our 1
natures 1
They 1
have 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
demand 1
it 1
back 1
That 1
is 1
quite 1
true 1
Dorian 1
cried 1
Hallward 1
Nothing 1
is 1
ever 1
quite 1
true 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
This 1
is 1
interrupted 1
Dorian 1
You 1
must 1
admit 1
Harry 1
that 1
women 1
give 1
to 1
men 1
the 1
very 1
gold 1
of 1
their 1
lives 1
Possibly 1
he 1
sighed 1
but 1
they 1
invariably 1
want 1
it 1
back 1
in 1
such 1
very 1
small 1
change 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
worry 1
Women 1
as 1
some 1
witty 1
Frenchman 1
once 1
put 1
it 1
inspire 1
us 1
with 1
the 1
desire 1
to 1
do 1
masterpieces 1
and 1
always 1
prevent 1
us 1
from 1
carrying 1
them 1
out 1
Harry 1
you 1
are 1
dreadful 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
why 1
I 1
like 1
you 1
so 1
much 1
You 1
will 1
always 1
like 1
me 1
Dorian 1
he 1
replied 1
Will 1
you 1
have 1
some 1
coffee 1
you 1
fellows 1
Waiter 1
bring 1
coffee 1
and 1
fine 1
champagne 1
and 1
some 1
cigarettes 1
No 1
don 1
t 1
mind 1
the 1
cigarettes 1
I 1
have 1
some 1
Basil 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
allow 1
you 1
to 1
smoke 1
cigars 1
You 1
must 1
have 1
a 1
cigarette 1
A 1
cigarette 1
is 1
the 1
perfect 1
type 1
of 1
a 1
perfect 1
pleasure 1
It 1
is 1
exquisite 1
and 1
it 1
leaves 1
one 1
unsatisfied 1
What 1
more 1
can 1
one 1
want 1
Yes 1
Dorian 1
you 1
will 1
always 1
be 1
fond 1
of 1
me 1
I 1
represent 1
to 1
you 1
all 1
the 1
sins 1
you 1
have 1
never 1
had 1
the 1
courage 1
to 1
commit 1
What 1
nonsense 1
you 1
talk 1
Harry 1
cried 1
the 1
lad 1
taking 1
a 1
light 1
from 1
a 1
fire 1
breathing 1
silver 1
dragon 1
that 1
the 1
waiter 1
had 1
placed 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
Let 1
us 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
theatre 1
When 1
Sibyl 1
comes 1
on 1
the 1
stage 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
a 1
new 1
ideal 1
of 1
life 1
She 1
will 1
represent 1
something 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
never 1
known 1
I 1
have 1
known 1
everything 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
with 1
a 1
tired 1
look 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
always 1
ready 1
for 1
a 1
new 1
emotion 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
however 1
that 1
for 1
me 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
such 1
thing 1
Still 1
your 1
wonderful 1
girl 1
may 1
thrill 1
me 1
I 1
love 1
acting 1
It 1
is 1
so 1
much 1
more 1
real 1
than 1
life 1
Let 1
us 1
go 1
Dorian 1
you 1
will 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
sorry 1
Basil 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
only 1
room 1
for 1
two 1
in 1
the 1
brougham 1
You 1
must 1
follow 1
us 1
in 1
a 1
hansom 1
They 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
put 1
on 1
their 1
coats 1
sipping 1
their 1
coffee 1
standing 1
The 1
painter 1
was 1
silent 1
and 1
preoccupied 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
gloom 1
over 1
him 1
He 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
this 1
marriage 1
and 1
yet 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
better 1
than 1
many 1
other 1
things 1
that 1
might 1
have 1
happened 1
After 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
they 1
all 1
passed 1
downstairs 1
He 1
drove 1
off 1
by 1
himself 1
as 1
had 1
been 1
arranged 1
and 1
watched 1
the 1
flashing 1
lights 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
brougham 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
A 1
strange 1
sense 1
of 1
loss 1
came 1
over 1
him 1
He 1
felt 1
that 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
would 1
never 1
again 1
be 1
to 1
him 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
past 1
Life 1
had 1
come 1
between 1
them 1
His 1
eyes 1
darkened 1
and 1
the 1
crowded 1
flaring 1
streets 1
became 1
blurred 1
to 1
his 1
eyes 1
When 1
the 1
cab 1
drew 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
theatre 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
grown 1
years 1
older 1
CHAPTER 1
For 1
some 1
reason 1
or 1
other 1
the 1
house 1
was 1
crowded 1
that 1
night 1
and 1
the 1
fat 1
Jew 1
manager 1
who 1
met 1
them 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
beaming 1
from 1
ear 1
to 1
ear 1
with 1
an 1
oily 1
tremulous 1
smile 1
He 1
escorted 1
them 1
to 1
their 1
box 1
with 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
pompous 1
humility 1
waving 1
his 1
fat 1
jewelled 1
hands 1
and 1
talking 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
his 1
voice 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
loathed 1
him 1
more 1
than 1
ever 1
He 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
look 1
for 1
Miranda 1
and 1
had 1
been 1
met 1
by 1
Caliban 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
upon 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
rather 1
liked 1
him 1
At 1
least 1
he 1
declared 1
he 1
did 1
and 1
insisted 1
on 1
shaking 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
assuring 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
proud 1
to 1
meet 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
discovered 1
a 1
real 1
genius 1
and 1
gone 1
bankrupt 1
over 1
a 1
poet 1
Hallward 1
amused 1
himself 1
with 1
watching 1
the 1
faces 1
in 1
the 1
pit 1
The 1
heat 1
was 1
terribly 1
oppressive 1
and 1
the 1
huge 1
sunlight 1
flamed 1
like 1
a 1
monstrous 1
dahlia 1
with 1
petals 1
of 1
yellow 1
fire 1
The 1
youths 1
in 1
the 1
gallery 1
had 1
taken 1
off 1
their 1
coats 1
and 1
waistcoats 1
and 1
hung 1
them 1
over 1
the 1
side 1
They 1
talked 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
across 1
the 1
theatre 1
and 1
shared 1
their 1
oranges 1
with 1
the 1
tawdry 1
girls 1
who 1
sat 1
beside 1
them 1
Some 1
women 1
were 1
laughing 1
in 1
the 1
pit 1
Their 1
voices 1
were 1
horribly 1
shrill 1
and 1
discordant 1
The 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
popping 1
of 1
corks 1
came 1
from 1
the 1
bar 1
What 1
a 1
place 1
to 1
find 1
one 1
s 1
divinity 1
in 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Yes 1
answered 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
It 1
was 1
here 1
I 1
found 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
is 1
divine 1
beyond 1
all 1
living 1
things 1
When 1
she 1
acts 1
you 1
will 1
forget 1
everything 1
These 1
common 1
rough 1
people 1
with 1
their 1
coarse 1
faces 1
and 1
brutal 1
gestures 1
become 1
quite 1
different 1
when 1
she 1
is 1
on 1
the 1
stage 1
They 1
sit 1
silently 1
and 1
watch 1
her 1
They 1
weep 1
and 1
laugh 1
as 1
she 1
wills 1
them 1
to 1
do 1
She 1
makes 1
them 1
as 1
responsive 1
as 1
a 1
violin 1
She 1
spiritualizes 1
them 1
and 1
one 1
feels 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
flesh 1
and 1
blood 1
as 1
one 1
s 1
self 1
The 1
same 1
flesh 1
and 1
blood 1
as 1
one 1
s 1
self 1
Oh 1
I 1
hope 1
not 1
exclaimed 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
who 1
was 1
scanning 1
the 1
occupants 1
of 1
the 1
gallery 1
through 1
his 1
opera 1
glass 1
Don 1
t 1
pay 1
any 1
attention 1
to 1
him 1
Dorian 1
said 1
the 1
painter 1
I 1
understand 1
what 1
you 1
mean 1
and 1
I 1
believe 1
in 1
this 1
girl 1
Any 1
one 1
you 1
love 1
must 1
be 1
marvellous 1
and 1
any 1
girl 1
who 1
has 1
the 1
effect 1
you 1
describe 1
must 1
be 1
fine 1
and 1
noble 1
To 1
spiritualize 1
one 1
s 1
age 1
that 1
is 1
something 1
worth 1
doing 1
If 1
this 1
girl 1
can 1
give 1
a 1
soul 1
to 1
those 1
who 1
have 1
lived 1
without 1
one 1
if 1
she 1
can 1
create 1
the 1
sense 1
of 1
beauty 1
in 1
people 1
whose 1
lives 1
have 1
been 1
sordid 1
and 1
ugly 1
if 1
she 1
can 1
strip 1
them 1
of 1
their 1
selfishness 1
and 1
lend 1
them 1
tears 1
for 1
sorrows 1
that 1
are 1
not 1
their 1
own 1
she 1
is 1
worthy 1
of 1
all 1
your 1
adoration 1
worthy 1
of 1
the 1
adoration 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
This 1
marriage 1
is 1
quite 1
right 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
think 1
so 1
at 1
first 1
but 1
I 1
admit 1
it 1
now 1
The 1
gods 1
made 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
for 1
you 1
Without 1
her 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
incomplete 1
Thanks 1
Basil 1
answered 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
pressing 1
his 1
hand 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
understand 1
me 1
Harry 1
is 1
so 1
cynical 1
he 1
terrifies 1
me 1
But 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
orchestra 1
It 1
is 1
quite 1
dreadful 1
but 1
it 1
only 1
lasts 1
for 1
about 1
five 1
minutes 1
Then 1
the 1
curtain 1
rises 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
the 1
girl 1
to 1
whom 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
give 1
all 1
my 1
life 1
to 1
whom 1
I 1
have 1
given 1
everything 1
that 1
is 1
good 1
in 1
me 1
A 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
afterwards 1
amidst 1
an 1
extraordinary 1
turmoil 1
of 1
applause 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
stepped 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
stage 1
Yes 1
she 1
was 1
certainly 1
lovely 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
loveliest 1
creatures 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
ever 1
seen 1
There 1
was 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
fawn 1
in 1
her 1
shy 1
grace 1
and 1
startled 1
eyes 1
A 1
faint 1
blush 1
like 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
a 1
rose 1
in 1
a 1
mirror 1
of 1
silver 1
came 1
to 1
her 1
cheeks 1
as 1
she 1
glanced 1
at 1
the 1
crowded 1
enthusiastic 1
house 1
She 1
stepped 1
back 1
a 1
few 1
paces 1
and 1
her 1
lips 1
seemed 1
to 1
tremble 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
leaped 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
applaud 1
Motionless 1
and 1
as 1
one 1
in 1
a 1
dream 1
sat 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
gazing 1
at 1
her 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
peered 1
through 1
his 1
glasses 1
murmuring 1
Charming 1
charming 1
The 1
scene 1
was 1
the 1
hall 1
of 1
Capulet 1
s 1
house 1
and 1
Romeo 1
in 1
his 1
pilgrim 1
s 1
dress 1
had 1
entered 1
with 1
Mercutio 1
and 1
his 1
other 1
friends 1
The 1
band 1
such 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
struck 1
up 1
a 1
few 1
bars 1
of 1
music 1
and 1
the 1
dance 1
began 1
Through 1
the 1
crowd 1
of 1
ungainly 1
shabbily 1
dressed 1
actors 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
moved 1
like 1
a 1
creature 1
from 1
a 1
finer 1
world 1
Her 1
body 1
swayed 1
while 1
she 1
danced 1
as 1
a 1
plant 1
sways 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
The 1
curves 1
of 1
her 1
throat 1
were 1
the 1
curves 1
of 1
a 1
white 1
lily 1
Her 1
hands 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
made 1
of 1
cool 1
ivory 1
Yet 1
she 1
was 1
curiously 1
listless 1
She 1
showed 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
joy 1
when 1
her 1
eyes 1
rested 1
on 1
Romeo 1
The 1
few 1
words 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
speak 1
Good 1
pilgrim 1
you 1
do 1
wrong 1
your 1
hand 1
too 1
much 1
Which 1
mannerly 1
devotion 1
shows 1
in 1
this 1
For 1
saints 1
have 1
hands 1
that 1
pilgrims 1
hands 1
do 1
touch 1
And 1
palm 1
to 1
palm 1
is 1
holy 1
palmers 1
kiss 1
with 1
the 1
brief 1
dialogue 1
that 1
follows 1
were 1
spoken 1
in 1
a 1
thoroughly 1
artificial 1
manner 1
The 1
voice 1
was 1
exquisite 1
but 1
from 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
of 1
tone 1
it 1
was 1
absolutely 1
false 1
It 1
was 1
wrong 1
in 1
colour 1
It 1
took 1
away 1
all 1
the 1
life 1
from 1
the 1
verse 1
It 1
made 1
the 1
passion 1
unreal 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
grew 1
pale 1
as 1
he 1
watched 1
her 1
He 1
was 1
puzzled 1
and 1
anxious 1
Neither 1
of 1
his 1
friends 1
dared 1
to 1
say 1
anything 1
to 1
him 1
She 1
seemed 1
to 1
them 1
to 1
be 1
absolutely 1
incompetent 1
They 1
were 1
horribly 1
disappointed 1
Yet 1
they 1
felt 1
that 1
the 1
true 1
test 1
of 1
any 1
Juliet 1
is 1
the 1
balcony 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
second 1
act 1
They 1
waited 1
for 1
that 1
If 1
she 1
failed 1
there 2
was 1
nothing 1
in 1
her 1
She 1
looked 1
charming 1
as 1
she 1
came 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
moonlight 1
That 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
denied 1
But 1
the 1
staginess 1
of 1
her 1
acting 1
was 1
unbearable 1
and 1
grew 1
worse 1
as 1
she 1
went 1
on 1
Her 1
gestures 1
became 1
absurdly 1
artificial 1
She 1
overemphasized 1
everything 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
say 1
The 1
beautiful 1
passage 1
Thou 1
knowest 1
the 1
mask 1
of 1
night 1
is 1
on 1
my 1
face 1
Else 1
would 1
a 1
maiden 1
blush 1
bepaint 1
my 1
cheek 1
For 1
that 1
which 1
thou 1
hast 1
heard 1
me 1
speak 1
to 1
night 1
was 1
declaimed 1
with 1
the 1
painful 1
precision 1
of 1
a 1
schoolgirl 1
who 1
has 1
been 1
taught 1
to 1
recite 1
by 1
some 1
second 1
rate 1
professor 1
of 1
elocution 1
When 1
she 1
leaned 1
over 1
the 1
balcony 1
and 1
came 1
to 1
those 1
wonderful 1
lines 1
Although 1
I 1
joy 1
in 1
thee 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
joy 1
of 1
this 1
contract 1
to 1
night 1
It 1
is 1
too 1
rash 1
too 1
unadvised 1
too 1
sudden 1
Too 1
like 1
the 1
lightning 1
which 1
doth 1
cease 1
to 1
be 1
Ere 1
one 1
can 1
say 1
It 1
lightens 1
Sweet 1
good 1
night 1
This 1
bud 1
of 1
love 1
by 1
summer 1
s 1
ripening 1
breath 1
May 1
prove 1
a 1
beauteous 1
flower 1
when 1
next 1
we 1
meet 1
she 1
spoke 1
the 1
words 1
as 1
though 1
they 1
conveyed 1
no 1
meaning 1
to 1
her 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
nervousness 1
Indeed 1
so 1
far 1
from 1
being 1
nervous 1
she 1
was 1
absolutely 1
self 1
contained 1
It 1
was 1
simply 1
bad 1
art 1
She 1
was 1
a 1
complete 1
failure 1
Even 1
the 1
common 1
uneducated 1
audience 1
of 1
the 1
pit 1
and 1
gallery 1
lost 1
their 1
interest 1
in 1
the 1
play 1
They 1
got 1
restless 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
talk 1
loudly 1
and 1
to 1
whistle 1
The 1
Jew 1
manager 1
who 1
was 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
dress 1
circle 1
stamped 1
and 1
swore 1
with 1
rage 1
The 1
only 1
person 1
unmoved 1
was 1
the 1
girl 1
herself 1
When 1
the 1
second 1
act 1
was 1
over 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
storm 1
of 1
hisses 1
and 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
got 1
up 1
from 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
put 1
on 1
his 1
coat 1
She 1
is 1
quite 1
beautiful 1
Dorian 1
he 1
said 1
but 1
she 1
can 1
t 1
act 1
Let 1
us 1
go 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
play 1
through 1
answered 1
the 1
lad 1
in 1
a 1
hard 1
bitter 1
voice 1
I 1
am 1
awfully 1
sorry 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
made 1
you 1
waste 1
an 1
evening 1
Harry 1
I 1
apologize 1
to 1
you 1
both 1
My 1
dear 1
Dorian 1
I 1
should 1
think 1
Miss 1
Vane 1
was 1
ill 1
interrupted 1
Hallward 1
We 1
will 1
come 1
some 1
other 1
night 1
I 1
wish 1
she 1
were 1
ill 1
he 1
rejoined 1
But 1
she 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
simply 1
callous 1
and 1
cold 1
She 1
has 1
entirely 1
altered 1
Last 1
night 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
artist 1
This 1
evening 1
she 1
is 1
merely 1
a 1
commonplace 1
mediocre 1
actress 1
Don 1
t 1
talk 1
like 1
that 1
about 1
any 1
one 1
you 1
love 1
Dorian 1
Love 1
is 1
a 1
more 1
wonderful 1
thing 1
than 1
art 1
They 1
are 1
both 1
simply 1
forms 1
of 1
imitation 1
remarked 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
But 1
do 1
let 1
us 1
go 1
Dorian 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
stay 1
here 1
any 1
longer 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
good 1
for 1
one 1
s 1
morals 1
to 1
see 1
bad 1
acting 1
Besides 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
suppose 1
you 1
will 1
want 1
your 1
wife 1
to 1
act 1
so 1
what 1
does 1
it 1
matter 1
if 1
she 1
plays 1
Juliet 1
like 1
a 1
wooden 1
doll 1
She 1
is 1
very 1
lovely 1
and 1
if 1
she 1
knows 1
as 1
little 1
about 1
life 1
as 1
she 1
does 1
about 1
acting 1
she 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
delightful 1
experience 1
There 1
are 1
only 1
two 1
kinds 1
of 1
people 1
who 1
are 1
really 1
fascinating 1
people 1
who 1
know 1
absolutely 1
everything 1
and 1
people 1
who 1
know 1
absolutely 1
nothing 1
Good 1
heavens 1
my 1
dear 1
boy 1
don 1
t 1
look 1
so 1
tragic 1
The 1
secret 1
of 1
remaining 1
young 1
is 1
never 1
to 1
have 1
an 1
emotion 1
that 1
is 1
unbecoming 1
Come 1
to 1
the 1
club 1
with 1
Basil 1
and 1
myself 1
We 1
will 1
smoke 1
cigarettes 1
and 1
drink 1
to 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
She 1
is 1
beautiful 1
What 1
more 1
can 1
you 1
want 1
Go 1
away 1
Harry 1
cried 1
the 1
lad 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
alone 1
Basil 1
you 1
must 1
go 1
Ah 1
can 1
t 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
my 1
heart 1
is 1
breaking 1
The 1
hot 1
tears 1
came 1
to 1
his 1
eyes 1
His 1
lips 1
trembled 1
and 1
rushing 1
to 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
box 1
he 1
leaned 1
up 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
hiding 1
his 1
face 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
Let 1
us 1
go 1
Basil 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
with 1
a 1
strange 1
tenderness 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
young 1
men 1
passed 1
out 1
together 1
A 1
few 1
moments 1
afterwards 1
the 1
footlights 1
flared 1
up 1
and 1
the 1
curtain 1
rose 1
on 1
the 1
third 1
act 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
seat 1
He 1
looked 1
pale 1
and 1
proud 1
and 1
indifferent 1
The 1
play 1
dragged 1
on 1
and 1
seemed 1
interminable 1
Half 1
of 1
the 1
audience 1
went 1
out 1
tramping 1
in 1
heavy 1
boots 1
and 1
laughing 1
The 1
whole 1
thing 1
was 1
a 1
fiasco 1
The 1
last 1
act 1
was 1
played 1
to 1
almost 1
empty 1
benches 1
The 1
curtain 1
went 1
down 1
on 1
a 1
titter 1
and 1
some 1
groans 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
over 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
rushed 1
behind 1
the 1
scenes 1
into 1
the 1
greenroom 1
The 1
girl 1
was 1
standing 1
there 1
alone 1
with 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
triumph 1
on 1
her 1
face 1
Her 1
eyes 1
were 1
lit 1
with 1
an 1
exquisite 1
fire 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
radiance 1
about 1
her 1
Her 1
parted 1
lips 1
were 1
smiling 1
over 1
some 1
secret 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
When 1
he 1
entered 1
she 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
infinite 1
joy 1
came 1
over 1
her 1
How 1
badly 1
I 1
acted 1
to 1
night 1
Dorian 1
she 1
cried 1
Horribly 1
he 1
answered 1
gazing 1
at 1
her 1
in 1
amazement 1
Horribly 1
It 1
was 1
dreadful 1
Are 1
you 1
ill 1
You 1
have 1
no 1
idea 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
You 1
have 1
no 1
idea 1
what 1
I 1
suffered 1
The 1
girl 1
smiled 1
Dorian 1
she 1
answered 1
lingering 1
over 1
his 1
name 1
with 1
long 1
drawn 1
music 1
in 1
her 1
voice 1
as 1
though 1
it 1
were 1
sweeter 1
than 1
honey 1
to 1
the 1
red 1
petals 1
of 1
her 1
mouth 1
Dorian 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
understood 1
But 1
you 1
understand 1
now 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
Understand 1
what 1
he 1
asked 1
angrily 1
Why 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
bad 1
to 1
night 1
Why 1
I 1
shall 1
always 1
be 1
bad 1
Why 1
I 1
shall 1
never 1
act 1
well 1
again 1
He 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
You 1
are 1
ill 1
I 1
suppose 1
When 1
you 1
are 1
ill 1
you 1
shouldn 1
t 1
act 1
You 1
make 1
yourself 1
ridiculous 1
My 1
friends 1
were 1
bored 1
I 1
was 1
bored 1
She 1
seemed 1
not 1
to 1
listen 1
to 1
him 1
She 1
was 1
transfigured 1
with 1
joy 1
An 1
ecstasy 1
of 1
happiness 1
dominated 1
her 1
Dorian 2
she 1
cried 1
before 1
I 1
knew 1
you 1
acting 1
was 1
the 1
one 1
reality 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
It 1
was 1
only 1
in 1
the 1
theatre 1
that 1
I 1
lived 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
true 1
I 1
was 1
Rosalind 1
one 1
night 1
and 1
Portia 1
the 1
other 1
The 1
joy 1
of 1
Beatrice 1
was 1
my 1
joy 1
and 1
the 1
sorrows 1
of 1
Cordelia 1
were 1
mine 1
also 1
I 1
believed 1
in 1
everything 1
The 1
common 1
people 1
who 1
acted 1
with 1
me 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
godlike 1
The 1
painted 1
scenes 1
were 1
my 1
world 1
I 1
knew 1
nothing 1
but 1
shadows 1
and 1
I 1
thought 1
them 1
real 1
You 1
came 1
oh 1
my 1
beautiful 1
love 1
and 1
you 1
freed 1
my 1
soul 1
from 1
prison 1
You 1
taught 1
me 1
what 1
reality 1
really 1
is 1
To 1
night 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
I 1
saw 1
through 1
the 1
hollowness 1
the 1
sham 1
the 1
silliness 1
of 1
the 1
empty 1
pageant 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
always 1
played 1
To 1
night 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
I 1
became 1
conscious 1
that 1
the 1
Romeo 1
was 1
hideous 1
and 1
old 1
and 1
painted 1
that 1
the 1
moonlight 1
in 1
the 1
orchard 1
was 1
false 1
that 1
the 1
scenery 1
was 1
vulgar 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
words 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
speak 1
were 1
unreal 1
were 1
not 1
my 1
words 1
were 1
not 1
what 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
say 1
You 1
had 1
brought 1
me 1
something 1
higher 1
something 1
of 1
which 1
all 1
art 1
is 1
but 1
a 1
reflection 1
You 1
had 1
made 1
me 1
understand 1
what 1
love 1
really 1
is 1
My 1
love 1
My 1
love 1
Prince 1
Charming 1
Prince 1
of 1
life 1
I 1
have 1
grown 1
sick 1
of 1
shadows 1
You 1
are 1
more 1
to 1
me 1
than 1
all 1
art 1
can 1
ever 1
be 1
What 1
have 1
I 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
the 1
puppets 1
of 1
a 1
play 1
When 1
I 1
came 1
on 1
to 1
night 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
understand 1
how 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
everything 1
had 1
gone 1
from 1
me 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
wonderful 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
do 1
nothing 1
Suddenly 1
it 1
dawned 1
on 1
my 1
soul 1
what 1
it 1
all 1
meant 1
The 1
knowledge 1
was 1
exquisite 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
heard 1
them 1
hissing 1
and 1
I 1
smiled 1
What 1
could 1
they 1
know 1
of 1
love 1
such 1
as 1
ours 1
Take 1
me 1
away 1
Dorian 1
take 1
me 1
away 1
with 1
you 1
where 1
we 1
can 1
be 1
quite 1
alone 1
I 1
hate 1
the 1
stage 1
I 1
might 1
mimic 1
a 1
passion 1
that 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
feel 1
but 1
I 1
cannot 1
mimic 1
one 1
that 1
burns 1
me 1
like 1
fire 1
Oh 1
Dorian 2
you 1
understand 1
now 1
what 1
it 1
signifies 1
Even 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
do 1
it 2
would 1
be 1
profanation 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
play 1
at 1
being 1
in 1
love 1
You 1
have 1
made 1
me 1
see 1
that 1
He 1
flung 1
himself 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
sofa 1
and 1
turned 1
away 1
his 1
face 1
You 1
have 1
killed 1
my 1
love 1
he 1
muttered 1
She 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
in 1
wonder 1
and 1
laughed 1
He 1
made 1
no 1
answer 1
She 1
came 1
across 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
with 1
her 1
little 1
fingers 1
stroked 1
his 1
hair 1
She 1
knelt 1
down 1
and 1
pressed 1
his 1
hands 1
to 1
her 1
lips 1
He 1
drew 1
them 1
away 1
and 1
a 1
shudder 1
ran 1
through 1
him 1
Then 1
he 1
leaped 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
Yes 1
he 1
cried 1
you 1
have 1
killed 1
my 1
love 1
You 1
used 1
to 1
stir 1
my 1
imagination 1
Now 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
even 1
stir 1
my 1
curiosity 1
You 1
simply 1
produce 1
no 1
effect 1
I 1
loved 1
you 1
because 1
you 1
were 1
marvellous 1
because 1
you 1
had 1
genius 1
and 1
intellect 1
because 1
you 1
realized 1
the 1
dreams 1
of 1
great 1
poets 1
and 1
gave 1
shape 1
and 1
substance 1
to 1
the 1
shadows 1
of 1
art 1
You 1
have 1
thrown 1
it 1
all 1
away 1
You 1
are 1
shallow 1
and 1
stupid 1
My 1
God 1
how 1
mad 1
I 1
was 1
to 1
love 1
you 1
What 1
a 1
fool 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
You 1
are 1
nothing 1
to 1
me 1
now 1
I 1
will 1
never 1
see 1
you 1
again 1
I 1
will 1
never 1
think 1
of 1
you 1
I 1
will 1
never 1
mention 1
your 1
name 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
you 1
were 1
to 1
me 1
once 1
Why 1
once 1
Oh 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
bear 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
had 1
never 1
laid 1
eyes 1
upon 1
you 1
You 1
have 1
spoiled 1
the 1
romance 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
How 1
little 1
you 1
can 1
know 1
of 1
love 1
if 1
you 1
say 1
it 1
mars 1
your 1
art 1
Without 1
your 1
art 1
you 1
are 1
nothing 1
I 1
would 1
have 1
made 1
you 1
famous 1
splendid 1
magnificent 1
The 1
world 1
would 1
have 1
worshipped 1
you 1
and 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
borne 1
my 1
name 1
What 1
are 1
you 1
now 1
A 1
third 1
rate 1
actress 1
with 1
a 1
pretty 1
face 1
The 1
girl 1
grew 1
white 1
and 1
trembled 1
She 1
clenched 1
her 1
hands 1
together 1
and 1
her 1
voice 1
seemed 1
to 1
catch 1
in 1
her 1
throat 1
You 1
are 1
not 1
serious 1
Dorian 1
she 1
murmured 1
You 1
are 1
acting 1
Acting 1
I 1
leave 1
that 1
to 1
you 1
You 1
do 1
it 1
so 1
well 1
he 1
answered 1
bitterly 1
She 1
rose 1
from 1
her 1
knees 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
piteous 1
expression 1
of 1
pain 1
in 1
her 1
face 1
came 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
to 1
him 1
She 1
put 1
her 1
hand 1
upon 1
his 1
arm 1
and 1
looked 1
into 1
his 1
eyes 1
He 1
thrust 1
her 1
back 1
Don 1
t 1
touch 1
me 1
he 1
cried 1
A 1
low 1
moan 1
broke 1
from 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
flung 1
herself 1
at 1
his 1
feet 1
and 1
lay 1
there 1
like 1
a 1
trampled 1
flower 1
Dorian 2
don 1
t 1
leave 1
me 1
she 1
whispered 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
sorry 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
act 1
well 1
I 1
was 1
thinking 1
of 1
you 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
But 1
I 1
will 1
try 1
indeed 1
I 1
will 1
try 1
It 1
came 1
so 1
suddenly 1
across 1
me 1
my 1
love 1
for 1
you 1
I 1
think 1
I 1
should 1
never 1
have 1
known 1
it 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
not 1
kissed 1
me 1
if 1
we 1
had 1
not 1
kissed 1
each 1
other 1
Kiss 1
me 1
again 1
my 1
love 1
Don 1
t 1
go 1
away 1
from 1
me 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
bear 1
it 1
Oh 1
don 1
t 1
go 1
away 1
from 1
me 1
My 1
brother 1
No 1
never 1
mind 1
He 1
didn 1
t 1
mean 1
it 1
He 1
was 1
in 1
jest 1
But 1
you 1
oh 1
can 1
t 1
you 1
forgive 1
me 1
for 1
to 1
night 1
I 1
will 1
work 1
so 1
hard 1
and 1
try 1
to 1
improve 1
Don 1
t 1
be 1
cruel 1
to 1
me 1
because 1
I 1
love 1
you 1
better 1
than 1
anything 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
After 1
all 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
once 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
pleased 1
you 1
But 1
you 1
are 1
quite 1
right 1
Dorian 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
shown 1
myself 1
more 1
of 1
an 1
artist 1
It 1
was 1
foolish 1
of 1
me 1
and 1
yet 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
help 1
it 1
Oh 1
don 1
t 1
leave 1
me 1
don 1
t 1
leave 1
me 1
A 1
fit 1
of 1
passionate 1
sobbing 1
choked 1
her 1
She 1
crouched 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
like 1
a 1
wounded 1
thing 1
and 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
with 1
his 1
beautiful 1
eyes 1
looked 1
down 1
at 1
her 1
and 1
his 1
chiselled 1
lips 1
curled 1
in 1
exquisite 1
disdain 1
There 1
is 1
always 1
something 1
ridiculous 1
about 1
the 1
emotions 1
of 1
people 1
whom 1
one 1
has 1
ceased 1
to 1
love 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
absurdly 1
melodramatic 1
Her 1
tears 1
and 1
sobs 1
annoyed 1
him 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
he 1
said 1
at 1
last 1
in 1
his 1
calm 1
clear 1
voice 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
unkind 1
but 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
see 1
you 1
again 1
You 1
have 1
disappointed 1
me 1
She 1
wept 1
silently 1
and 1
made 1
no 1
answer 1
but 1
crept 1
nearer 1
Her 1
little 1
hands 1
stretched 1
blindly 1
out 1
and 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
seeking 1
for 1
him 1
He 1
turned 1
on 1
his 1
heel 1
and 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
In 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
he 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
theatre 1
Where 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
he 1
hardly 1
knew 1
He 1
remembered 1
wandering 1
through 1
dimly 1
lit 1
streets 1
past 1
gaunt 1
black 1
shadowed 1
archways 1
and 1
evil 1
looking 1
houses 1
Women 1
with 1
hoarse 1
voices 1
and 1
harsh 1
laughter 1
had 1
called 1
after 1
him 1
Drunkards 1
had 1
reeled 1
by 1
cursing 1
and 1
chattering 1
to 1
themselves 1
like 1
monstrous 1
apes 1
He 1
had 1
seen 1
grotesque 1
children 1
huddled 1
upon 1
door 1
steps 1
and 1
heard 1
shrieks 1
and 1
oaths 1
from 1
gloomy 1
courts 1
As 1
the 1
dawn 1
was 1
just 1
breaking 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
close 1
to 1
Covent 1
Garden 1
The 1
darkness 1
lifted 1
and 1
flushed 1
with 1
faint 1
fires 1
the 1
sky 1
hollowed 1
itself 1
into 1
a 1
perfect 1
pearl 1
Huge 1
carts 1
filled 1
with 1
nodding 1
lilies 1
rumbled 1
slowly 1
down 1
the 1
polished 1
empty 1
street 1
The 1
air 1
was 1
heavy 1
with 1
the 1
perfume 1
of 1
the 1
flowers 1
and 1
their 1
beauty 1
seemed 1
to 1
bring 1
him 1
an 1
anodyne 1
for 1
his 1
pain 1
He 1
followed 1
into 1
the 1
market 1
and 1
watched 1
the 1
men 1
unloading 1
their 1
waggons 1
A 1
white 1
smocked 1
carter 1
offered 1
him 1
some 1
cherries 1
He 1
thanked 1
him 1
wondered 1
why 1
he 1
refused 1
to 1
accept 1
any 1
money 1
for 1
them 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
eat 1
them 1
listlessly 1
They 1
had 1
been 1
plucked 1
at 1
midnight 1
and 1
the 1
coldness 1
of 1
the 1
moon 1
had 1
entered 1
into 1
them 1
A 1
long 1
line 1
of 1
boys 1
carrying 1
crates 1
of 1
striped 1
tulips 1
and 1
of 1
yellow 1
and 1
red 1
roses 1
defiled 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
threading 1
their 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
huge 1
jade 1
green 1
piles 1
of 1
vegetables 1
Under 1
the 1
portico 1
with 1
its 1
grey 1
sun 1
bleached 1
pillars 1
loitered 1
a 1
troop 1
of 1
draggled 1
bareheaded 1
girls 1
waiting 1
for 1
the 1
auction 1
to 1
be 1
over 1
Others 1
crowded 1
round 1
the 1
swinging 1
doors 1
of 1
the 1
coffee 1
house 1
in 1
the 1
piazza 1
The 1
heavy 1
cart 1
horses 1
slipped 1
and 1
stamped 1
upon 1
the 1
rough 1
stones 1
shaking 1
their 1
bells 1
and 1
trappings 1
Some 1
of 1
the 1
drivers 1
were 1
lying 1
asleep 1
on 1
a 1
pile 1
of 1
sacks 1
Iris 1
necked 1
and 1
pink 1
footed 1
the 1
pigeons 1
ran 1
about 1
picking 1
up 1
seeds 1
After 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
he 1
hailed 1
a 1
hansom 1
and 1
drove 1
home 1
For 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
he 1
loitered 1
upon 1
the 1
doorstep 1
looking 1
round 1
at 1
the 1
silent 1
square 1
with 1
its 1
blank 1
close 1
shuttered 1
windows 1
and 1
its 1
staring 1
blinds 1
The 1
sky 1
was 1
pure 1
opal 1
now 1
and 1
the 1
roofs 1
of 1
the 1
houses 1
glistened 1
like 1
silver 1
against 1
it 1
From 1
some 1
chimney 1
opposite 1
a 1
thin 1
wreath 1
of 1
smoke 1
was 1
rising 1
It 1
curled 1
a 1
violet 1
riband 1
through 1
the 1
nacre 1
coloured 1
air 1
In 1
the 1
huge 1
gilt 1
Venetian 1
lantern 1
spoil 1
of 1
some 1
Doge 1
s 1
barge 1
that 1
hung 1
from 1
the 1
ceiling 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
oak 1
panelled 1
hall 1
of 1
entrance 1
lights 1
were 1
still 1
burning 1
from 1
three 1
flickering 1
jets 1
thin 1
blue 1
petals 1
of 1
flame 1
they 1
seemed 1
rimmed 1
with 1
white 1
fire 1
He 1
turned 1
them 1
out 1
and 1
having 1
thrown 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
cape 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
passed 1
through 1
the 1
library 1
towards 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
his 1
bedroom 1
a 1
large 1
octagonal 1
chamber 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
floor 1
that 1
in 1
his 1
new 1
born 1
feeling 1
for 1
luxury 1
he 1
had 1
just 1
had 1
decorated 1
for 1
himself 1
and 1
hung 1
with 1
some 1
curious 1
Renaissance 1
tapestries 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
discovered 1
stored 1
in 1
a 1
disused 1
attic 1
at 1
Selby 1
Royal 1
As 1
he 1
was 1
turning 1
the 1
handle 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
his 1
eye 1
fell 1
upon 1
the 1
portrait 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
had 1
painted 1
of 1
him 1
He 1
started 1
back 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
surprise 1
Then 1
he 1
went 1
on 1
into 1
his 1
own 1
room 1
looking 1
somewhat 1
puzzled 1
After 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
the 1
button 1
hole 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
coat 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
hesitate 1
Finally 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
went 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
picture 1
and 1
examined 1
it 1
In 1
the 1
dim 1
arrested 1
light 1
that 1
struggled 1
through 1
the 1
cream 1
coloured 1
silk 1
blinds 1
the 1
face 1
appeared 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
little 1
changed 1
The 1
expression 1
looked 1
different 1
One 1
would 1
have 1
said 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
touch 1
of 1
cruelty 1
in 1
the 1
mouth 1
It 1
was 1
certainly 1
strange 1
He 1
turned 1
round 1
and 1
walking 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
drew 1
up 1
the 1
blind 1
The 1
bright 1
dawn 1
flooded 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
swept 1
the 1
fantastic 1
shadows 1
into 1
dusky 1
corners 1
where 1
they 1
lay 1
shuddering 1
But 1
the 1
strange 1
expression 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
noticed 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
portrait 1
seemed 1
to 1
linger 1
there 1
to 1
be 1
more 1
intensified 1
even 1
The 1
quivering 1
ardent 1
sunlight 1
showed 1
him 1
the 1
lines 1
of 1
cruelty 1
round 1
the 1
mouth 1
as 1
clearly 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
looking 1
into 1
a 1
mirror 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
some 1
dreadful 1
thing 1
He 1
winced 1
and 1
taking 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
an 1
oval 1
glass 1
framed 1
in 1
ivory 1
Cupids 1
one 1
of 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
s 1
many 1
presents 1
to 1
him 1
glanced 1
hurriedly 1
into 1
its 1
polished 1
depths 1
No 1
line 1
like 1
that 1
warped 1
his 1
red 1
lips 1
What 1
did 1
it 1
mean 1
He 1
rubbed 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
came 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
picture 1
and 1
examined 1
it 1
again 1
There 1
were 1
no 1
signs 1
of 1
any 1
change 1
when 1
he 1
looked 1
into 1
the 1
actual 1
painting 1
and 1
yet 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
the 1
whole 1
expression 1
had 1
altered 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
mere 1
fancy 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
The 1
thing 1
was 1
horribly 1
apparent 1
He 1
threw 1
himself 1
into 1
a 1
chair 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
Suddenly 1
there 1
flashed 1
across 1
his 1
mind 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
said 1
in 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
s 1
studio 1
the 1
day 1
the 1
picture 1
had 1
been 1
finished 1
Yes 1
he 1
remembered 1
it 1
perfectly 1
He 1
had 1
uttered 1
a 1
mad 1
wish 1
that 1
he 1
himself 1
might 1
remain 1
young 1
and 1
the 1
portrait 1
grow 1
old 1
that 1
his 1
own 1
beauty 1
might 1
be 1
untarnished 1
and 1
the 1
face 1
on 1
the 1
canvas 1
bear 1
the 1
burden 1
of 1
his 1
passions 1
and 1
his 1
sins 1
that 1
the 1
painted 1
image 1
might 1
be 1
seared 1
with 1
the 1
lines 1
of 1
suffering 1
and 1
thought 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
keep 1
all 1
the 1
delicate 1
bloom 1
and 1
loveliness 1
of 1
his 1
then 1
just 1
conscious 1
boyhood 1
Surely 1
his 1
wish 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
fulfilled 1
Such 1
things 1
were 1
impossible 1
It 1
seemed 1
monstrous 1
even 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
them 1
And 1
yet 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
picture 1
before 1
him 1
with 1
the 1
touch 1
of 1
cruelty 1
in 1
the 1
mouth 1
Cruelty 1
Had 1
he 1
been 1
cruel 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
girl 1
s 1
fault 1
not 1
his 1
He 1
had 1
dreamed 1
of 1
her 1
as 1
a 1
great 1
artist 1
had 1
given 1
his 1
love 1
to 1
her 1
because 1
he 1
had 1
thought 1
her 1
great 1
Then 1
she 1
had 1
disappointed 1
him 1
She 1
had 1
been 1
shallow 1
and 1
unworthy 1
And 1
yet 1
a 1
feeling 1
of 1
infinite 1
regret 1
came 1
over 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
her 1
lying 1
at 1
his 1
feet 1
sobbing 1
like 1
a 1
little 1
child 1
He 1
remembered 1
with 1
what 1
callousness 1
he 1
had 1
watched 1
her 1
Why 1
had 1
he 1
been 1
made 1
like 1
that 1
Why 1
had 1
such 1
a 1
soul 1
been 1
given 1
to 1
him 1
But 1
he 1
had 1
suffered 1
also 1
During 1
the 1
three 1
terrible 1
hours 1
that 1
the 1
play 1
had 1
lasted 1
he 1
had 1
lived 1
centuries 1
of 1
pain 1
aeon 1
upon 1
aeon 1
of 1
torture 1
His 1
life 1
was 1
well 1
worth 1
hers 1
She 1
had 1
marred 1
him 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
wounded 1
her 1
for 1
an 1
age 1
Besides 1
women 1
were 1
better 1
suited 1
to 1
bear 1
sorrow 1
than 1
men 1
They 1
lived 1
on 1
their 1
emotions 1
They 1
only 1
thought 1
of 1
their 1
emotions 1
When 1
they 1
took 1
lovers 1
it 1
was 1
merely 1
to 1
have 1
some 1
one 1
with 1
whom 1
they 1
could 1
have 1
scenes 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
had 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
and 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
knew 1
what 1
women 1
were 1
Why 1
should 1
he 1
trouble 1
about 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
She 1
was 1
nothing 1
to 1
him 1
now 1
But 1
the 1
picture 1
What 1
was 1
he 1
to 1
say 1
of 1
that 1
It 1
held 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
and 1
told 1
his 1
story 1
It 1
had 1
taught 1
him 1
to 1
love 1
his 1
own 1
beauty 1
Would 1
it 1
teach 1
him 1
to 1
loathe 1
his 1
own 1
soul 1
Would 1
he 1
ever 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
again 1
No 1
it 1
was 1
merely 1
an 1
illusion 1
wrought 1
on 1
the 1
troubled 1
senses 1
The 1
horrible 1
night 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
passed 1
had 1
left 1
phantoms 1
behind 1
it 1
Suddenly 1
there 1
had 1
fallen 1
upon 1
his 1
brain 1
that 1
tiny 1
scarlet 1
speck 1
that 1
makes 1
men 1
mad 1
The 1
picture 1
had 1
not 1
changed 1
It 1
was 1
folly 1
to 1
think 1
so 1
Yet 1
it 1
was 1
watching 1
him 1
with 1
its 1
beautiful 1
marred 1
face 1
and 1
its 1
cruel 1
smile 1
Its 1
bright 1
hair 1
gleamed 1
in 1
the 1
early 1
sunlight 1
Its 1
blue 1
eyes 1
met 1
his 1
own 1
A 1
sense 1
of 1
infinite 1
pity 1
not 1
for 1
himself 1
but 1
for 1
the 1
painted 1
image 1
of 1
himself 1
came 1
over 1
him 1
It 1
had 1
altered 1
already 1
and 1
would 1
alter 1
more 1
Its 1
gold 1
would 1
wither 1
into 1
grey 1
Its 1
red 1
and 1
white 1
roses 1
would 1
die 1
For 1
every 1
sin 1
that 1
he 1
committed 1
a 1
stain 1
would 1
fleck 1
and 1
wreck 1
its 1
fairness 1
But 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
sin 1
The 1
picture 1
changed 1
or 1
unchanged 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
visible 1
emblem 1
of 1
conscience 1
He 1
would 1
resist 1
temptation 1
He 1
would 1
not 1
see 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
any 1
more 1
would 1
not 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
listen 1
to 1
those 1
subtle 1
poisonous 1
theories 1
that 1
in 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
s 1
garden 1
had 1
first 1
stirred 1
within 1
him 1
the 1
passion 1
for 1
impossible 1
things 1
He 1
would 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
make 1
her 1
amends 1
marry 1
her 1
try 1
to 1
love 1
her 1
again 1
Yes 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
duty 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
She 1
must 1
have 1
suffered 1
more 1
than 1
he 1
had 1
Poor 1
child 1
He 1
had 1
been 1
selfish 1
and 1
cruel 1
to 1
her 1
The 1
fascination 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
exercised 1
over 1
him 1
would 1
return 1
They 1
would 1
be 1
happy 1
together 1
His 1
life 1
with 1
her 1
would 1
be 1
beautiful 1
and 1
pure 1
He 1
got 1
up 1
from 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
drew 1
a 1
large 1
screen 1
right 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
portrait 1
shuddering 1
as 1
he 1
glanced 1
at 1
it 1
How 1
horrible 1
he 1
murmured 1
to 1
himself 1
and 1
he 1
walked 1
across 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
opened 1
it 1
When 1
he 1
stepped 1
out 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
grass 1
he 1
drew 1
a 1
deep 1
breath 1
The 1
fresh 1
morning 1
air 1
seemed 1
to 1
drive 1
away 1
all 1
his 1
sombre 1
passions 1
He 1
thought 1
only 1
of 1
Sibyl 1
A 1
faint 1
echo 1
of 1
his 1
love 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
him 1
He 1
repeated 1
her 1
name 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
again 1
The 1
birds 1
that 1
were 1
singing 1
in 1
the 1
dew 1
drenched 1
garden 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
telling 1
the 1
flowers 1
about 1
her 1
CHAPTER 1
It 1
was 1
long 1
past 1
noon 1
when 1
he 1
awoke 1
His 1
valet 1
had 1
crept 1
several 1
times 1
on 1
tiptoe 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
stirring 1
and 1
had 1
wondered 1
what 1
made 1
his 1
young 1
master 1
sleep 1
so 1
late 1
Finally 1
his 1
bell 1
sounded 1
and 1
Victor 1
came 1
in 1
softly 1
with 1
a 1
cup 1
of 1
tea 1
and 1
a 1
pile 1
of 1
letters 1
on 1
a 1
small 1
tray 1
of 1
old 1
Sevres 1
china 1
and 1
drew 1
back 1
the 1
olive 1
satin 1
curtains 1
with 1
their 1
shimmering 1
blue 1
lining 1
that 1
hung 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
three 1
tall 1
windows 1
Monsieur 1
has 1
well 1
slept 1
this 1
morning 1
he 1
said 1
smiling 1
What 1
o 1
clock 1
is 1
it 1
Victor 1
asked 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
drowsily 1
One 1
hour 1
and 1
a 1
quarter 1
Monsieur 1
How 1
late 1
it 1
was 1
He 1
sat 1
up 1
and 1
having 1
sipped 1
some 1
tea 1
turned 1
over 1
his 1
letters 1
One 1
of 1
them 1
was 1
from 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
and 1
had 1
been 1
brought 1
by 1
hand 1
that 1
morning 1
He 1
hesitated 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
then 1
put 1
it 1
aside 1
The 1
others 1
he 1
opened 1
listlessly 1
They 1
contained 1
the 1
usual 1
collection 1
of 1
cards 1
invitations 1
to 1
dinner 1
tickets 1
for 1
private 1
views 1
programmes 1
of 1
charity 1
concerts 1
and 1
the 1
like 1
that 1
are 1
showered 1
on 1
fashionable 1
young 1
men 1
every 1
morning 1
during 1
the 1
season 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
rather 1
heavy 1
bill 1
for 1
a 1
chased 1
silver 1
Louis 1
Quinze 1
toilet 1
set 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
had 1
the 1
courage 1
to 1
send 1
on 1
to 1
his 1
guardians 1
who 1
were 1
extremely 1
old 1
fashioned 1
people 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
realize 1
that 1
we 1
live 1
in 1
an 1
age 1
when 1
unnecessary 1
things 1
are 1
our 1
only 1
necessities 1
and 1
there 1
were 1
several 1
very 1
courteously 1
worded 1
communications 1
from 1
Jermyn 1
Street 1
money 1
lenders 1
offering 1
to 1
advance 1
any 1
sum 1
of 1
money 1
at 1
a 1
moment 1
s 1
notice 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
most 1
reasonable 1
rates 1
of 1
interest 1
After 1
about 1
ten 1
minutes 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
throwing 1
on 1
an 1
elaborate 1
dressing 1
gown 1
of 1
silk 1
embroidered 1
cashmere 1
wool 1
passed 1
into 1
the 1
onyx 1
paved 1
bathroom 1
The 1
cool 1
water 1
refreshed 1
him 1
after 1
his 1
long 1
sleep 1
He 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
forgotten 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
through 1
A 1
dim 1
sense 1
of 1
having 1
taken 1
part 1
in 1
some 1
strange 1
tragedy 1
came 1
to 1
him 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
unreality 1
of 1
a 1
dream 1
about 1
it 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
dressed 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
library 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
a 1
light 1
French 1
breakfast 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
laid 1
out 1
for 1
him 1
on 1
a 1
small 1
round 1
table 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
open 1
window 1
It 1
was 1
an 1
exquisite 1
day 1
The 1
warm 1
air 1
seemed 1
laden 1
with 1
spices 1
A 1
bee 1
flew 1
in 1
and 1
buzzed 1
round 1
the 1
blue 1
dragon 1
bowl 1
that 1
filled 1
with 1
sulphur 1
yellow 1
roses 1
stood 1
before 1
him 1
He 1
felt 1
perfectly 1
happy 1
Suddenly 1
his 1
eye 1
fell 1
on 1
the 1
screen 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
placed 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
portrait 1
and 1
he 1
started 1
Too 1
cold 1
for 1
Monsieur 1
asked 1
his 1
valet 1
putting 1
an 1
omelette 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
I 1
shut 1
the 1
window 1
Dorian 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
cold 1
he 1
murmured 1
Was 1
it 1
all 1
true 1
Had 1
the 1
portrait 1
really 1
changed 1
Or 1
had 1
it 1
been 1
simply 1
his 1
own 1
imagination 1
that 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
see 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
evil 1
where 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
joy 1
Surely 1
a 1
painted 1
canvas 1
could 1
not 1
alter 1
The 1
thing 1
was 1
absurd 1
It 1
would 1
serve 1
as 1
a 1
tale 1
to 1
tell 1
Basil 1
some 1
day 1
It 1
would 1
make 1
him 1
smile 1
And 1
yet 1
how 1
vivid 1
was 1
his 1
recollection 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
First 1
in 1
the 1
dim 1
twilight 1
and 1
then 1
in 1
the 1
bright 1
dawn 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
the 1
touch 1
of 1
cruelty 1
round 1
the 1
warped 1
lips 1
He 1
almost 1
dreaded 1
his 1
valet 1
leaving 1
the 1
room 1
He 1
knew 1
that 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
alone 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
examine 1
the 1
portrait 1
He 1
was 1
afraid 1
of 1
certainty 1
When 1
the 1
coffee 1
and 1
cigarettes 1
had 1
been 1
brought 1
and 1
the 1
man 1
turned 1
to 1
go 1
he 1
felt 1
a 1
wild 1
desire 1
to 1
tell 1
him 1
to 1
remain 1
As 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
closing 1
behind 1
him 1
he 1
called 1
him 1
back 1
The 1
man 1
stood 1
waiting 1
for 1
his 1
orders 1
Dorian 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
at 1
home 1
to 1
any 1
one 1
Victor 1
he 1
said 1
with 1
a 1
sigh 1
The 1
man 1
bowed 1
and 1
retired 1
Then 1
he 1
rose 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
lit 1
a 1
cigarette 1
and 1
flung 1
himself 1
down 1
on 1
a 1
luxuriously 1
cushioned 1
couch 1
that 1
stood 1
facing 1
the 1
screen 1
The 1
screen 1
was 1
an 1
old 1
one 1
of 1
gilt 1
Spanish 1
leather 1
stamped 1
and 1
wrought 1
with 1
a 1
rather 1
florid 1
Louis 1
Quatorze 1
pattern 1
He 1
scanned 1
it 1
curiously 1
wondering 1
if 1
ever 1
before 1
it 1
had 1
concealed 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
life 1
Should 1
he 1
move 1
it 1
aside 1
after 1
all 1
Why 1
not 1
let 1
it 1
stay 1
there 1
What 1
was 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
knowing 1
If 1
the 1
thing 1
was 1
true 1
it 1
was 1
terrible 1
If 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
true 1
why 1
trouble 1
about 1
it 1
But 1
what 1
if 1
by 1
some 1
fate 1
or 1
deadlier 1
chance 1
eyes 1
other 1
than 1
his 1
spied 1
behind 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
horrible 1
change 1
What 1
should 1
he 1
do 1
if 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
came 1
and 1
asked 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
his 1
own 1
picture 1
Basil 1
would 1
be 1
sure 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
No 1
the 1
thing 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
examined 1
and 1
at 1
once 1
Anything 1
would 1
be 1
better 1
than 1
this 1
dreadful 1
state 1
of 1
doubt 1
He 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
locked 1
both 1
doors 1
At 1
least 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
alone 1
when 1
he 1
looked 1
upon 1
the 1
mask 1
of 1
his 1
shame 1
Then 1
he 1
drew 1
the 1
screen 1
aside 1
and 1
saw 1
himself 1
face 1
to 1
face 1
It 1
was 1
perfectly 1
true 1
The 1
portrait 1
had 1
altered 1
As 1
he 1
often 1
remembered 1
afterwards 1
and 1
always 1
with 1
no 1
small 1
wonder 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
at 1
first 1
gazing 1
at 1
the 1
portrait 1
with 1
a 1
feeling 1
of 1
almost 1
scientific 1
interest 1
That 1
such 1
a 1
change 1
should 1
have 1
taken 1
place 1
was 1
incredible 1
to 1
him 1
And 1
yet 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
fact 1
Was 1
there 1
some 1
subtle 1
affinity 1
between 1
the 1
chemical 1
atoms 1
that 1
shaped 1
themselves 1
into 1
form 1
and 1
colour 1
on 1
the 1
canvas 1
and 1
the 1
soul 1
that 1
was 1
within 1
him 1
Could 1
it 1
be 1
that 1
what 1
that 1
soul 1
thought 1
they 1
realized 1
that 1
what 1
it 1
dreamed 1
they 1
made 1
true 1
Or 1
was 1
there 1
some 1
other 1
more 1
terrible 1
reason 1
He 1
shuddered 1
and 1
felt 1
afraid 1
and 1
going 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
couch 1
lay 1
there 1
gazing 1
at 1
the 1
picture 1
in 1
sickened 1
horror 1
One 1
thing 1
however 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
done 1
for 1
him 1
It 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
conscious 1
how 1
unjust 1
how 1
cruel 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
to 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
too 1
late 1
to 1
make 1
reparation 1
for 1
that 1
She 1
could 1
still 1
be 1
his 1
wife 1
His 1
unreal 1
and 1
selfish 1
love 1
would 1
yield 1
to 1
some 1
higher 1
influence 1
would 1
be 1
transformed 1
into 1
some 1
nobler 1
passion 1
and 1
the 1
portrait 1
that 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
had 1
painted 1
of 1
him 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
guide 1
to 1
him 1
through 1
life 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
him 1
what 1
holiness 1
is 1
to 1
some 1
and 1
conscience 1
to 1
others 1
and 1
the 1
fear 1
of 1
God 1
to 1
us 1
all 1
There 1
were 1
opiates 1
for 1
remorse 1
drugs 1
that 1
could 1
lull 1
the 1
moral 1
sense 1
to 1
sleep 1
But 1
here 1
was 1
a 1
visible 1
symbol 1
of 1
the 1
degradation 1
of 1
sin 1
Here 1
was 1
an 1
ever 1
present 1
sign 1
of 1
the 1
ruin 1
men 1
brought 1
upon 1
their 1
souls 1
Three 1
o 1
clock 1
struck 1
and 1
four 1
and 1
the 1
half 1
hour 1
rang 1
its 1
double 1
chime 1
but 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
did 1
not 1
stir 1
He 1
was 1
trying 1
to 1
gather 1
up 1
the 1
scarlet 1
threads 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
to 1
weave 1
them 1
into 1
a 1
pattern 1
to 1
find 1
his 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
sanguine 1
labyrinth 1
of 1
passion 1
through 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
wandering 1
He 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
or 1
what 1
to 1
think 1
Finally 1
he 1
went 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
wrote 1
a 1
passionate 1
letter 1
to 1
the 1
girl 1
he 1
had 1
loved 1
imploring 1
her 1
forgiveness 1
and 1
accusing 1
himself 1
of 1
madness 1
He 1
covered 1
page 1
after 1
page 1
with 1
wild 1
words 1
of 1
sorrow 1
and 1
wilder 1
words 1
of 1
pain 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
luxury 1
in 1
self 1
reproach 1
When 1
we 1
blame 1
ourselves 1
we 1
feel 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
has 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
blame 1
us 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
confession 1
not 1
the 1
priest 1
that 1
gives 1
us 1
absolution 1
When 1
Dorian 1
had 1
finished 1
the 1
letter 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
forgiven 1
Suddenly 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
knock 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
he 1
heard 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
s 1
voice 1
outside 1
My 1
dear 1
boy 1
I 1
must 1
see 1
you 1
Let 1
me 1
in 1
at 1
once 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
bear 1
your 1
shutting 1
yourself 1
up 1
like 1
this 1
He 1
made 1
no 1
answer 1
at 1
first 1
but 1
remained 1
quite 1
still 1
The 1
knocking 1
still 1
continued 1
and 1
grew 1
louder 1
Yes 1
it 1
was 1
better 1
to 1
let 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
in 1
and 1
to 1
explain 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
new 1
life 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
lead 1
to 1
quarrel 1
with 1
him 1
if 1
it 1
became 1
necessary 1
to 1
quarrel 1
to 1
part 1
if 1
parting 1
was 1
inevitable 1
He 1
jumped 1
up 1
drew 1
the 1
screen 1
hastily 1
across 1
the 1
picture 1
and 1
unlocked 1
the 1
door 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
sorry 1
for 1
it 1
all 1
Dorian 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
as 1
he 1
entered 1
But 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
think 1
too 1
much 1
about 1
it 1
Do 1
you 1
mean 1
about 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
asked 1
the 1
lad 1
Yes 1
of 1
course 1
answered 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
sinking 1
into 1
a 1
chair 1
and 1
slowly 1
pulling 1
off 1
his 1
yellow 1
gloves 1
It 1
is 1
dreadful 1
from 1
one 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
your 1
fault 1
Tell 1
me 1
did 1
you 1
go 1
behind 1
and 1
see 1
her 1
after 1
the 1
play 1
was 1
over 1
Yes 1
I 1
felt 1
sure 1
you 1
had 1
Did 1
you 1
make 1
a 1
scene 1
with 1
her 1
I 1
was 1
brutal 1
Harry 1
perfectly 1
brutal 1
But 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
right 1
now 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
sorry 1
for 1
anything 1
that 1
has 1
happened 1
It 1
has 1
taught 1
me 1
to 1
know 1
myself 1
better 1
Ah 1
Dorian 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
glad 1
you 1
take 1
it 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
I 1
was 1
afraid 1
I 1
would 1
find 1
you 1
plunged 1
in 1
remorse 1
and 1
tearing 1
that 1
nice 1
curly 1
hair 1
of 1
yours 1
I 1
have 1
got 1
through 1
all 1
that 1
said 1
Dorian 1
shaking 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
smiling 1
I 1
am 1
perfectly 1
happy 1
now 1
I 1
know 1
what 1
conscience 1
is 1
to 1
begin 1
with 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
what 1
you 1
told 1
me 1
it 1
was 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
divinest 1
thing 1
in 1
us 1
Don 1
t 1
sneer 1
at 1
it 1
Harry 1
any 1
more 1
at 1
least 1
not 1
before 1
me 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
good 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
bear 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
my 1
soul 1
being 1
hideous 1
A 1
very 1
charming 1
artistic 1
basis 1
for 1
ethics 1
Dorian 1
I 1
congratulate 1
you 1
on 1
it 1
But 1
how 1
are 1
you 1
going 1
to 1
begin 1
By 1
marrying 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
Marrying 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
cried 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
standing 1
up 1
and 1
looking 1
at 1
him 1
in 1
perplexed 1
amazement 1
But 1
my 1
dear 1
Dorian 1
Yes 1
Harry 1
I 1
know 1
what 1
you 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
say 1
Something 1
dreadful 1
about 1
marriage 1
Don 1
t 1
say 1
it 1
Don 1
t 1
ever 1
say 1
things 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
to 1
me 1
again 1
Two 1
days 1
ago 1
I 1
asked 1
Sibyl 1
to 1
marry 1
me 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
break 1
my 1
word 1
to 1
her 1
She 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
my 1
wife 1
Your 1
wife 1
Dorian 1
Didn 1
t 1
you 1
get 1
my 1
letter 1
I 1
wrote 1
to 1
you 1
this 1
morning 1
and 1
sent 1
the 1
note 1
down 1
by 1
my 1
own 1
man 1
Your 1
letter 1
Oh 1
yes 1
I 1
remember 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
read 1
it 1
yet 1
Harry 1
I 1
was 1
afraid 1
there 1
might 1
be 1
something 1
in 1
it 1
that 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
like 1
You 1
cut 1
life 1
to 1
pieces 1
with 1
your 1
epigrams 1
You 1
know 1
nothing 1
then 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
walked 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
sitting 1
down 1
by 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
took 1
both 1
his 1
hands 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
and 1
held 1
them 1
tightly 1
Dorian 1
he 1
said 1
my 1
letter 1
don 1
t 1
be 1
frightened 1
was 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
is 1
dead 1
A 1
cry 1
of 1
pain 1
broke 1
from 1
the 1
lad 1
s 1
lips 1
and 1
he 1
leaped 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
tearing 1
his 1
hands 1
away 1
from 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
s 1
grasp 1
Dead 1
Sibyl 1
dead 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
true 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
horrible 1
lie 1
How 1
dare 1
you 1
say 1
it 1
It 1
is 1
quite 1
true 1
Dorian 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
gravely 1
It 1
is 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
morning 1
papers 1
I 1
wrote 1
down 1
to 1
you 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
not 1
to 1
see 1
any 1
one 1
till 1
I 1
came 1
There 1
will 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
an 1
inquest 1
of 1
course 1
and 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
be 1
mixed 1
up 1
in 1
it 1
Things 1
like 1
that 1
make 1
a 1
man 1
fashionable 1
in 1
Paris 1
But 1
in 1
London 1
people 1
are 1
so 1
prejudiced 1
Here 1
one 1
should 1
never 1
make 1
one 1
s 1
debut 1
with 1
a 1
scandal 1
One 1
should 1
reserve 1
that 1
to 1
give 1
an 1
interest 1
to 1
one 1
s 1
old 1
age 1
I 1
suppose 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
your 1
name 1
at 1
the 1
theatre 1
If 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
right 1
Did 1
any 1
one 1
see 1
you 1
going 1
round 1
to 1
her 1
room 1
That 1
is 1
an 1
important 1
point 1
Dorian 1
did 1
not 1
answer 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
He 1
was 1
dazed 1
with 1
horror 1
Finally 1
he 1
stammered 1
in 1
a 1
stifled 1
voice 1
Harry 1
did 1
you 1
say 1
an 1
inquest 1
What 1
did 1
you 1
mean 1
by 1
that 1
Did 1
Sibyl 1
Oh 1
Harry 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
bear 1
it 1
But 1
be 1
quick 1
Tell 1
me 1
everything 1
at 1
once 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
an 1
accident 1
Dorian 1
though 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
put 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
public 1
It 1
seems 1
that 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
leaving 1
the 1
theatre 1
with 1
her 1
mother 1
about 1
half 1
past 1
twelve 1
or 1
so 1
she 1
said 1
she 1
had 1
forgotten 1
something 1
upstairs 1
They 1
waited 1
some 1
time 1
for 1
her 1
but 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
down 1
again 1
They 1
ultimately 1
found 1
her 1
lying 1
dead 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
of 1
her 1
dressing 1
room 1
She 1
had 1
swallowed 1
something 1
by 1
mistake 1
some 1
dreadful 1
thing 1
they 1
use 1
at 1
theatres 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
but 1
it 1
had 1
either 1
prussic 1
acid 1
or 1
white 1
lead 1
in 1
it 1
I 1
should 1
fancy 1
it 1
was 1
prussic 1
acid 1
as 1
she 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
died 1
instantaneously 1
Harry 2
it 1
is 1
terrible 1
cried 1
the 1
lad 1
Yes 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
tragic 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
get 1
yourself 1
mixed 1
up 1
in 1
it 1
I 1
see 1
by 1
The 1
Standard 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
seventeen 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
thought 1
she 1
was 1
almost 1
younger 1
than 1
that 1
She 1
looked 1
such 1
a 1
child 1
and 1
seemed 1
to 1
know 1
so 1
little 1
about 1
acting 1
Dorian 1
you 1
mustn 1
t 1
let 1
this 1
thing 1
get 1
on 1
your 1
nerves 1
You 1
must 1
come 1
and 1
dine 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
afterwards 1
we 1
will 1
look 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
opera 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
Patti 1
night 1
and 1
everybody 1
will 1
be 1
there 1
You 1
can 1
come 1
to 1
my 1
sister 1
s 1
box 1
She 1
has 1
got 1
some 1
smart 1
women 1
with 1
her 1
So 1
I 1
have 1
murdered 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
said 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
half 1
to 1
himself 1
murdered 1
her 1
as 1
surely 1
as 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
cut 1
her 1
little 1
throat 1
with 1
a 1
knife 1
Yet 1
the 1
roses 1
are 1
not 1
less 1
lovely 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
The 1
birds 1
sing 1
just 1
as 1
happily 1
in 1
my 1
garden 1
And 1
to 1
night 1
I 1
am 1
to 1
dine 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
then 1
go 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
opera 1
and 1
sup 1
somewhere 1
I 1
suppose 1
afterwards 1
How 1
extraordinarily 1
dramatic 1
life 1
is 1
If 1
I 1
had 1
read 1
all 1
this 1
in 1
a 1
book 1
Harry 1
I 1
think 1
I 1
would 1
have 1
wept 1
over 1
it 1
Somehow 1
now 1
that 1
it 1
has 1
happened 1
actually 1
and 1
to 1
me 1
it 1
seems 1
far 1
too 1
wonderful 1
for 1
tears 1
Here 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
passionate 1
love 1
letter 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
written 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
Strange 1
that 1
my 1
first 1
passionate 1
love 1
letter 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
addressed 1
to 1
a 1
dead 1
girl 1
Can 1
they 1
feel 1
I 1
wonder 1
those 1
white 1
silent 1
people 1
we 1
call 1
the 1
dead 1
Sibyl 1
Can 1
she 1
feel 1
or 1
know 1
or 1
listen 1
Oh 1
Harry 1
how 1
I 1
loved 1
her 1
once 1
It 1
seems 1
years 1
ago 1
to 1
me 1
now 1
She 1
was 1
everything 1
to 1
me 1
Then 1
came 1
that 1
dreadful 1
night 1
was 1
it 1
really 1
only 1
last 1
night 1
when 1
she 1
played 1
so 1
badly 1
and 1
my 1
heart 1
almost 1
broke 1
She 1
explained 1
it 1
all 1
to 1
me 1
It 1
was 1
terribly 1
pathetic 1
But 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
moved 1
a 1
bit 1
I 1
thought 1
her 1
shallow 1
Suddenly 1
something 1
happened 1
that 1
made 1
me 1
afraid 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
tell 1
you 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
terrible 1
I 1
said 1
I 1
would 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
her 1
I 1
felt 1
I 1
had 1
done 1
wrong 1
And 1
now 1
she 1
is 1
dead 1
My 1
God 1
My 1
God 1
Harry 1
what 1
shall 1
I 1
do 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
the 1
danger 1
I 1
am 1
in 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
to 1
keep 1
me 1
straight 1
She 1
would 1
have 1
done 1
that 1
for 1
me 1
She 1
had 1
no 1
right 1
to 1
kill 1
herself 1
It 1
was 1
selfish 1
of 1
her 1
My 1
dear 1
Dorian 1
answered 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
taking 1
a 1
cigarette 1
from 1
his 1
case 1
and 1
producing 1
a 1
gold 1
latten 1
matchbox 1
the 1
only 1
way 1
a 1
woman 1
can 1
ever 1
reform 1
a 1
man 1
is 1
by 1
boring 1
him 1
so 1
completely 1
that 1
he 1
loses 1
all 1
possible 1
interest 1
in 1
life 1
If 1
you 1
had 1
married 1
this 1
girl 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
wretched 1
Of 1
course 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
treated 1
her 1
kindly 1
One 1
can 1
always 1
be 1
kind 1
to 1
people 1
about 1
whom 1
one 1
cares 1
nothing 1
But 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
soon 1
found 1
out 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
absolutely 1
indifferent 1
to 1
her 1
And 1
when 1
a 1
woman 1
finds 1
that 1
out 1
about 1
her 1
husband 1
she 1
either 1
becomes 1
dreadfully 1
dowdy 1
or 1
wears 1
very 1
smart 1
bonnets 1
that 1
some 1
other 1
woman 1
s 1
husband 1
has 1
to 1
pay 1
for 1
I 1
say 1
nothing 1
about 1
the 1
social 1
mistake 1
which 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
abject 1
which 1
of 1
course 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
allowed 1
but 1
I 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
in 1
any 1
case 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
an 1
absolute 1
failure 1
I 1
suppose 1
it 1
would 1
muttered 1
the 1
lad 1
walking 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
looking 1
horribly 1
pale 1
But 1
I 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
my 1
duty 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
my 1
fault 1
that 1
this 1
terrible 1
tragedy 1
has 1
prevented 1
my 1
doing 1
what 1
was 1
right 1
I 1
remember 1
your 1
saying 1
once 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
fatality 1
about 1
good 1
resolutions 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
always 1
made 1
too 1
late 1
Mine 1
certainly 1
were 1
Good 1
resolutions 1
are 1
useless 1
attempts 1
to 1
interfere 1
with 1
scientific 1
laws 1
Their 1
origin 1
is 1
pure 1
vanity 1
Their 1
result 1
is 1
absolutely 1
nil 1
They 1
give 1
us 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
some 1
of 1
those 1
luxurious 1
sterile 1
emotions 1
that 1
have 1
a 1
certain 1
charm 1
for 1
the 1
weak 1
That 1
is 1
all 1
that 1
can 1
be 1
said 1
for 1
them 1
They 1
are 1
simply 1
cheques 1
that 1
men 1
draw 1
on 1
a 1
bank 1
where 1
they 1
have 1
no 1
account 1
Harry 1
cried 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
coming 1
over 1
and 1
sitting 1
down 1
beside 1
him 1
why 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
I 1
cannot 1
feel 1
this 1
tragedy 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
I 1
am 1
heartless 1
Do 1
you 1
You 1
have 1
done 1
too 1
many 1
foolish 1
things 1
during 1
the 1
last 1
fortnight 1
to 1
be 1
entitled 1
to 1
give 1
yourself 1
that 1
name 1
Dorian 1
answered 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
with 1
his 1
sweet 1
melancholy 1
smile 1
The 1
lad 1
frowned 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
that 1
explanation 1
Harry 1
he 1
rejoined 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
glad 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
I 1
am 1
heartless 1
I 1
am 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
I 1
know 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
And 1
yet 1
I 1
must 1
admit 1
that 1
this 1
thing 1
that 1
has 1
happened 1
does 1
not 1
affect 1
me 1
as 1
it 1
should 1
It 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
simply 1
like 1
a 1
wonderful 1
ending 1
to 1
a 1
wonderful 1
play 1
It 1
has 1
all 1
the 1
terrible 1
beauty 1
of 1
a 1
Greek 1
tragedy 1
a 1
tragedy 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
took 1
a 1
great 1
part 1
but 1
by 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
wounded 1
It 1
is 1
an 1
interesting 1
question 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
who 1
found 1
an 1
exquisite 1
pleasure 1
in 1
playing 1
on 1
the 1
lad 1
s 1
unconscious 1
egotism 1
an 1
extremely 1
interesting 1
question 1
I 1
fancy 1
that 1
the 1
true 1
explanation 1
is 1
this 1
It 1
often 1
happens 1
that 1
the 1
real 1
tragedies 1
of 1
life 1
occur 1
in 1
such 1
an 1
inartistic 1
manner 1
that 1
they 1
hurt 1
us 1
by 1
their 1
crude 1
violence 1
their 1
absolute 1
incoherence 1
their 1
absurd 1
want 1
of 1
meaning 1
their 1
entire 1
lack 1
of 1
style 1
They 1
affect 1
us 1
just 1
as 1
vulgarity 1
affects 1
us 1
They 1
give 1
us 1
an 1
impression 1
of 1
sheer 1
brute 1
force 1
and 1
we 1
revolt 1
against 1
that 1
Sometimes 1
however 1
a 1
tragedy 1
that 1
possesses 1
artistic 1
elements 1
of 1
beauty 1
crosses 1
our 1
lives 1
If 1
these 1
elements 1
of 1
beauty 1
are 1
real 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
simply 1
appeals 1
to 1
our 1
sense 1
of 1
dramatic 1
effect 1
Suddenly 1
we 1
find 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
no 1
longer 1
the 1
actors 1
but 1
the 1
spectators 1
of 1
the 1
play 1
Or 1
rather 1
we 1
are 1
both 1
We 1
watch 1
ourselves 1
and 1
the 1
mere 1
wonder 1
of 1
the 1
spectacle 1
enthralls 1
us 1
In 1
the 1
present 1
case 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
has 1
really 1
happened 1
Some 1
one 1
has 1
killed 1
herself 1
for 1
love 1
of 1
you 1
I 1
wish 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
ever 1
had 1
such 1
an 1
experience 1
It 1
would 1
have 1
made 1
me 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
love 1
for 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
The 1
people 1
who 1
have 1
adored 1
me 1
there 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
very 1
many 1
but 1
there 1
have 1
been 1
some 1
have 1
always 1
insisted 1
on 1
living 1
on 1
long 1
after 1
I 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
care 1
for 1
them 1
or 1
they 1
to 1
care 1
for 1
me 1
They 1
have 1
become 1
stout 1
and 1
tedious 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
meet 1
them 1
they 1
go 1
in 1
at 1
once 1
for 1
reminiscences 1
That 1
awful 1
memory 1
of 1
woman 1
What 1
a 1
fearful 1
thing 1
it 1
is 1
And 1
what 1
an 1
utter 1
intellectual 1
stagnation 1
it 1
reveals 1
One 1
should 1
absorb 1
the 1
colour 1
of 1
life 1
but 1
one 1
should 1
never 1
remember 1
its 1
details 1
Details 1
are 1
always 1
vulgar 1
I 1
must 1
sow 1
poppies 1
in 1
my 1
garden 1
sighed 1
Dorian 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
necessity 1
rejoined 1
his 1
companion 1
Life 1
has 1
always 1
poppies 1
in 1
her 1
hands 1
Of 1
course 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
things 1
linger 1
I 1
once 1
wore 1
nothing 1
but 1
violets 1
all 1
through 1
one 1
season 1
as 1
a 1
form 1
of 1
artistic 1
mourning 1
for 1
a 1
romance 1
that 1
would 1
not 1
die 1
Ultimately 1
however 1
it 1
did 1
die 1
I 1
forget 1
what 1
killed 1
it 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
was 1
her 1
proposing 1
to 1
sacrifice 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
for 1
me 1
That 1
is 1
always 1
a 1
dreadful 1
moment 1
It 1
fills 1
one 1
with 1
the 1
terror 1
of 1
eternity 1
Well 1
would 1
you 1
believe 1
it 1
a 1
week 1
ago 1
at 1
Lady 1
Hampshire 1
s 1
I 1
found 1
myself 1
seated 1
at 1
dinner 1
next 1
the 1
lady 1
in 1
question 1
and 1
she 1
insisted 1
on 1
going 1
over 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
again 1
and 1
digging 1
up 1
the 1
past 1
and 1
raking 1
up 1
the 1
future 1
I 1
had 1
buried 1
my 1
romance 1
in 1
a 1
bed 1
of 1
asphodel 1
She 1
dragged 1
it 1
out 1
again 1
and 1
assured 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
spoiled 1
her 1
life 1
I 1
am 1
bound 1
to 1
state 1
that 1
she 1
ate 1
an 1
enormous 1
dinner 1
so 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
feel 1
any 1
anxiety 1
But 1
what 1
a 1
lack 1
of 1
taste 1
she 1
showed 1
The 1
one 1
charm 1
of 1
the 1
past 1
is 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
past 1
But 1
women 1
never 1
know 1
when 1
the 1
curtain 1
has 1
fallen 1
They 1
always 1
want 1
a 1
sixth 1
act 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
interest 1
of 1
the 1
play 1
is 1
entirely 1
over 1
they 1
propose 1
to 1
continue 1
it 1
If 1
they 1
were 1
allowed 1
their 1
own 1
way 1
every 1
comedy 1
would 1
have 1
a 1
tragic 1
ending 1
and 1
every 1
tragedy 1
would 1
culminate 1
in 1
a 1
farce 1
They 1
are 1
charmingly 1
artificial 1
but 1
they 1
have 1
no 1
sense 1
of 1
art 1
You 1
are 1
more 1
fortunate 1
than 1
I 1
am 1
I 1
assure 1
you 1
Dorian 1
that 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
women 1
I 1
have 1
known 1
would 1
have 1
done 1
for 1
me 1
what 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
did 1
for 1
you 1
Ordinary 1
women 1
always 1
console 1
themselves 1
Some 1
of 1
them 1
do 1
it 1
by 1
going 1
in 1
for 1
sentimental 1
colours 1
Never 1
trust 1
a 1
woman 1
who 1
wears 1
mauve 1
whatever 1
her 1
age 1
may 1
be 1
or 1
a 1
woman 1
over 1
thirty 1
five 1
who 1
is 1
fond 1
of 1
pink 1
ribbons 1
It 1
always 1
means 1
that 1
they 1
have 1
a 1
history 1
Others 1
find 1
a 1
great 1
consolation 1
in 1
suddenly 1
discovering 1
the 1
good 1
qualities 1
of 1
their 1
husbands 1
They 1
flaunt 1
their 1
conjugal 1
felicity 1
in 1
one 1
s 1
face 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
the 1
most 1
fascinating 1
of 1
sins 1
Religion 1
consoles 1
some 1
Its 1
mysteries 1
have 1
all 1
the 1
charm 1
of 1
a 1
flirtation 1
a 1
woman 1
once 1
told 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
can 1
quite 1
understand 1
it 1
Besides 1
nothing 1
makes 1
one 1
so 1
vain 1
as 1
being 1
told 1
that 1
one 1
is 1
a 1
sinner 1
Conscience 1
makes 1
egotists 1
of 1
us 1
all 1
Yes 1
there 1
is 1
really 1
no 1
end 1
to 1
the 1
consolations 1
that 1
women 1
find 1
in 1
modern 1
life 1
Indeed 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
mentioned 1
the 1
most 1
important 1
one 1
What 1
is 1
that 1
Harry 1
said 1
the 1
lad 1
listlessly 1
Oh 1
the 1
obvious 1
consolation 1
Taking 1
some 1
one 1
else 1
s 1
admirer 1
when 1
one 1
loses 1
one 1
s 1
own 1
In 1
good 1
society 1
that 1
always 1
whitewashes 1
a 1
woman 1
But 1
really 1
Dorian 1
how 1
different 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
from 1
all 1
the 1
women 1
one 1
meets 1
There 1
is 1
something 1
to 1
me 1
quite 1
beautiful 1
about 1
her 1
death 1
I 1
am 1
glad 1
I 1
am 1
living 1
in 1
a 1
century 1
when 1
such 1
wonders 1
happen 1
They 1
make 1
one 1
believe 1
in 1
the 1
reality 1
of 1
the 1
things 1
we 1
all 1
play 1
with 1
such 1
as 1
romance 1
passion 1
and 1
love 1
I 1
was 1
terribly 1
cruel 1
to 1
her 1
You 1
forget 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
women 1
appreciate 1
cruelty 1
downright 1
cruelty 1
more 1
than 1
anything 1
else 1
They 1
have 1
wonderfully 1
primitive 1
instincts 1
We 1
have 1
emancipated 1
them 1
but 1
they 1
remain 1
slaves 1
looking 1
for 1
their 1
masters 1
all 1
the 1
same 1
They 1
love 1
being 1
dominated 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
you 1
were 1
splendid 1
I 1
have 1
never 1
seen 1
you 1
really 1
and 1
absolutely 1
angry 1
but 1
I 1
can 1
fancy 1
how 1
delightful 1
you 1
looked 1
And 1
after 1
all 1
you 1
said 1
something 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
yesterday 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
to 1
be 1
merely 1
fanciful 1
but 1
that 1
I 1
see 1
now 1
was 1
absolutely 1
true 1
and 1
it 1
holds 1
the 1
key 1
to 1
everything 1
What 1
was 1
that 1
Harry 1
You 1
said 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
represented 1
to 1
you 1
all 1
the 1
heroines 1
of 1
romance 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
Desdemona 1
one 1
night 1
and 1
Ophelia 1
the 1
other 1
that 1
if 1
she 1
died 1
as 1
Juliet 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
life 1
as 1
Imogen 1
She 1
will 1
never 1
come 1
to 1
life 1
again 1
now 1
muttered 1
the 1
lad 1
burying 1
his 1
face 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
No 1
she 1
will 1
never 1
come 1
to 1
life 1
She 1
has 1
played 1
her 1
last 1
part 1
But 1
you 1
must 1
think 1
of 1
that 1
lonely 1
death 1
in 1
the 1
tawdry 1
dressing 1
room 1
simply 1
as 1
a 1
strange 1
lurid 1
fragment 1
from 1
some 1
Jacobean 1
tragedy 1
as 1
a 1
wonderful 1
scene 1
from 1
Webster 1
or 1
Ford 1
or 1
Cyril 1
Tourneur 1
The 1
girl 1
never 1
really 1
lived 1
and 1
so 1
she 1
has 1
never 1
really 1
died 1
To 1
you 1
at 1
least 1
she 1
was 1
always 1
a 1
dream 1
a 1
phantom 1
that 1
flitted 1
through 1
Shakespeare 1
s 1
plays 1
and 1
left 1
them 1
lovelier 1
for 1
its 1
presence 1
a 1
reed 1
through 1
which 1
Shakespeare 1
s 1
music 1
sounded 1
richer 1
and 1
more 1
full 1
of 1
joy 1
The 1
moment 1
she 1
touched 1
actual 1
life 1
she 1
marred 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
marred 1
her 1
and 1
so 1
she 1
passed 1
away 1
Mourn 1
for 1
Ophelia 1
if 1
you 1
like 1
Put 1
ashes 1
on 1
your 1
head 1
because 1
Cordelia 1
was 1
strangled 1
Cry 1
out 1
against 1
Heaven 1
because 1
the 1
daughter 1
of 1
Brabantio 1
died 1
But 1
don 1
t 1
waste 1
your 1
tears 1
over 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
She 1
was 1
less 1
real 1
than 1
they 1
are 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
silence 1
The 1
evening 1
darkened 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
Noiselessly 1
and 1
with 1
silver 1
feet 1
the 1
shadows 1
crept 1
in 1
from 1
the 1
garden 1
The 1
colours 1
faded 1
wearily 1
out 1
of 1
things 1
After 1
some 1
time 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
looked 1
up 1
You 1
have 1
explained 1
me 1
to 1
myself 1
Harry 1
he 1
murmured 1
with 1
something 1
of 1
a 1
sigh 1
of 1
relief 1
I 1
felt 1
all 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
said 1
but 1
somehow 1
I 1
was 1
afraid 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
express 1
it 1
to 1
myself 1
How 1
well 1
you 1
know 1
me 1
But 1
we 1
will 1
not 1
talk 1
again 1
of 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
It 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
marvellous 1
experience 1
That 1
is 1
all 1
I 1
wonder 1
if 1
life 1
has 1
still 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
me 1
anything 1
as 1
marvellous 1
Life 1
has 1
everything 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
you 1
Dorian 1
There 1
is 1
nothing 1
that 1
you 1
with 1
your 1
extraordinary 1
good 1
looks 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
do 1
But 1
suppose 1
Harry 1
I 1
became 1
haggard 1
and 1
old 1
and 1
wrinkled 1
What 1
then 1
Ah 1
then 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
rising 1
to 1
go 1
then 1
my 1
dear 1
Dorian 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
fight 1
for 1
your 1
victories 1
As 1
it 1
is 1
they 1
are 1
brought 1
to 1
you 1
No 1
you 1
must 1
keep 1
your 1
good 1
looks 1
We 1
live 1
in 1
an 1
age 1
that 1
reads 1
too 1
much 1
to 1
be 1
wise 1
and 1
that 1
thinks 1
too 1
much 1
to 1
be 1
beautiful 1
We 1
cannot 1
spare 1
you 1
And 1
now 1
you 1
had 1
better 1
dress 1
and 1
drive 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
club 1
We 1
are 1
rather 1
late 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
I 1
think 1
I 1
shall 1
join 1
you 1
at 1
the 1
opera 1
Harry 1
I 1
feel 1
too 1
tired 1
to 1
eat 1
anything 1
What 1
is 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
your 1
sister 1
s 1
box 1
Twenty 1
seven 1
I 1
believe 1
It 1
is 1
on 1
the 1
grand 1
tier 1
You 1
will 1
see 1
her 1
name 1
on 1
the 1
door 1
But 1
I 1
am 1
sorry 1
you 1
won 1
t 1
come 1
and 1
dine 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
feel 1
up 1
to 1
it 1
said 1
Dorian 1
listlessly 1
But 1
I 1
am 1
awfully 1
obliged 1
to 1
you 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
said 1
to 1
me 1
You 1
are 1
certainly 1
my 1
best 1
friend 1
No 1
one 1
has 1
ever 1
understood 1
me 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
We 1
are 1
only 1
at 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
our 1
friendship 1
Dorian 1
answered 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
shaking 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
Good 1
bye 1
I 1
shall 1
see 1
you 1
before 1
nine 1
thirty 1
I 1
hope 1
Remember 1
Patti 1
is 1
singing 1
As 1
he 1
closed 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
him 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
touched 1
the 1
bell 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
Victor 1
appeared 1
with 1
the 1
lamps 1
and 1
drew 1
the 1
blinds 1
down 1
He 1
waited 1
impatiently 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
go 1
The 1
man 1
seemed 1
to 1
take 1
an 1
interminable 1
time 1
over 1
everything 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
he 1
rushed 1
to 1
the 1
screen 1
and 1
drew 1
it 1
back 1
No 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
further 1
change 1
in 1
the 1
picture 1
It 1
had 1
received 1
the 1
news 1
of 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
s 1
death 1
before 1
he 1
had 1
known 1
of 1
it 1
himself 1
It 1
was 1
conscious 1
of 1
the 1
events 1
of 1
life 1
as 1
they 1
occurred 1
The 1
vicious 1
cruelty 1
that 1
marred 1
the 1
fine 1
lines 1
of 1
the 1
mouth 1
had 1
no 1
doubt 1
appeared 1
at 1
the 1
very 1
moment 1
that 1
the 1
girl 1
had 1
drunk 1
the 1
poison 1
whatever 1
it 1
was 1
Or 1
was 1
it 1
indifferent 1
to 1
results 1
Did 1
it 1
merely 1
take 1
cognizance 1
of 1
what 1
passed 1
within 1
the 1
soul 1
He 1
wondered 1
and 1
hoped 1
that 1
some 1
day 1
he 1
would 1
see 1
the 1
change 1
taking 1
place 1
before 1
his 1
very 1
eyes 1
shuddering 1
as 1
he 1
hoped 1
it 1
Poor 1
Sibyl 1
What 1
a 1
romance 1
it 1
had 1
all 1
been 1
She 1
had 1
often 1
mimicked 1
death 1
on 1
the 1
stage 1
Then 1
Death 1
himself 1
had 1
touched 1
her 1
and 1
taken 1
her 1
with 1
him 1
How 1
had 1
she 1
played 1
that 1
dreadful 1
last 1
scene 1
Had 1
she 1
cursed 1
him 1
as 1
she 1
died 1
No 1
she 1
had 1
died 1
for 1
love 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
love 1
would 1
always 1
be 1
a 1
sacrament 1
to 1
him 1
now 1
She 1
had 1
atoned 1
for 1
everything 1
by 1
the 1
sacrifice 1
she 1
had 1
made 1
of 1
her 1
life 1
He 1
would 1
not 1
think 1
any 1
more 1
of 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
go 1
through 1
on 1
that 1
horrible 1
night 1
at 1
the 1
theatre 1
When 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
her 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
as 1
a 1
wonderful 1
tragic 1
figure 1
sent 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
world 1
s 1
stage 1
to 1
show 1
the 1
supreme 1
reality 1
of 1
love 1
A 1
wonderful 1
tragic 1
figure 1
Tears 1
came 1
to 1
his 1
eyes 1
as 1
he 1
remembered 1
her 1
childlike 1
look 1
and 1
winsome 1
fanciful 1
ways 1
and 1
shy 1
tremulous 1
grace 1
He 1
brushed 1
them 1
away 1
hastily 1
and 1
looked 1
again 1
at 1
the 1
picture 1
He 1
felt 1
that 1
the 1
time 1
had 1
really 1
come 1
for 1
making 1
his 1
choice 1
Or 1
had 1
his 1
choice 1
already 1
been 1
made 1
Yes 1
life 1
had 1
decided 1
that 1
for 1
him 1
life 1
and 1
his 1
own 1
infinite 1
curiosity 1
about 1
life 1
Eternal 1
youth 1
infinite 1
passion 1
pleasures 1
subtle 1
and 1
secret 1
wild 1
joys 1
and 1
wilder 1
sins 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
have 1
all 1
these 1
things 1
The 1
portrait 1
was 1
to 1
bear 1
the 1
burden 1
of 1
his 1
shame 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
A 1
feeling 1
of 1
pain 1
crept 1
over 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
desecration 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
the 1
fair 1
face 1
on 1
the 1
canvas 1
Once 1
in 1
boyish 1
mockery 1
of 1
Narcissus 1
he 1
had 1
kissed 1
or 1
feigned 1
to 1
kiss 1
those 1
painted 1
lips 1
that 1
now 1
smiled 1
so 1
cruelly 1
at 1
him 1
Morning 1
after 1
morning 1
he 1
had 1
sat 1
before 1
the 1
portrait 1
wondering 1
at 1
its 1
beauty 1
almost 1
enamoured 1
of 1
it 1
as 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
at 1
times 1
Was 1
it 1
to 1
alter 1
now 1
with 1
every 1
mood 1
to 1
which 1
he 1
yielded 1
Was 1
it 1
to 1
become 1
a 1
monstrous 1
and 1
loathsome 1
thing 1
to 1
be 1
hidden 1
away 1
in 1
a 1
locked 1
room 1
to 1
be 1
shut 1
out 1
from 1
the 1
sunlight 1
that 1
had 1
so 1
often 1
touched 1
to 1
brighter 1
gold 1
the 1
waving 1
wonder 1
of 1
its 1
hair 1
The 1
pity 1
of 1
it 1
the 1
pity 1
of 1
it 1
For 1
a 1
moment 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
praying 1
that 1
the 1
horrible 1
sympathy 1
that 1
existed 1
between 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
picture 1
might 1
cease 1
It 1
had 1
changed 1
in 1
answer 1
to 1
a 1
prayer 1
perhaps 1
in 1
answer 1
to 1
a 1
prayer 1
it 1
might 1
remain 1
unchanged 1
And 1
yet 1
who 1
that 1
knew 1
anything 1
about 1
life 1
would 1
surrender 1
the 1
chance 1
of 1
remaining 1
always 1
young 1
however 1
fantastic 1
that 1
chance 1
might 1
be 1
or 1
with 1
what 1
fateful 1
consequences 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
fraught 1
Besides 1
was 1
it 1
really 1
under 1
his 1
control 1
Had 1
it 1
indeed 1
been 1
prayer 1
that 1
had 1
produced 1
the 1
substitution 1
Might 1
there 1
not 1
be 1
some 1
curious 1
scientific 1
reason 1
for 1
it 1
all 1
If 1
thought 1
could 1
exercise 1
its 1
influence 1
upon 1
a 1
living 1
organism 1
might 1
not 1
thought 1
exercise 1
an 1
influence 1
upon 1
dead 1
and 1
inorganic 1
things 1
Nay 1
without 1
thought 1
or 1
conscious 1
desire 1
might 1
not 1
things 1
external 1
to 1
ourselves 1
vibrate 1
in 1
unison 1
with 1
our 1
moods 1
and 1
passions 1
atom 1
calling 1
to 1
atom 1
in 1
secret 1
love 1
or 1
strange 1
affinity 1
But 1
the 1
reason 1
was 1
of 1
no 1
importance 1
He 1
would 1
never 1
again 1
tempt 1
by 1
a 1
prayer 1
any 1
terrible 1
power 1
If 1
the 1
picture 1
was 1
to 1
alter 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
alter 1
That 1
was 1
all 1
Why 1
inquire 1
too 1
closely 1
into 1
it 1
For 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
real 1
pleasure 1
in 1
watching 1
it 1
He 1
would 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
follow 1
his 1
mind 1
into 1
its 1
secret 1
places 1
This 1
portrait 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
most 1
magical 1
of 1
mirrors 1
As 1
it 1
had 1
revealed 1
to 1
him 1
his 1
own 1
body 1
so 1
it 1
would 1
reveal 1
to 1
him 1
his 1
own 1
soul 1
And 1
when 1
winter 1
came 1
upon 1
it 1
he 1
would 1
still 1
be 1
standing 1
where 1
spring 1
trembles 1
on 1
the 1
verge 1
of 1
summer 1
When 1
the 1
blood 1
crept 1
from 1
its 1
face 1
and 1
left 1
behind 1
a 1
pallid 1
mask 1
of 1
chalk 1
with 1
leaden 1
eyes 1
he 1
would 1
keep 1
the 1
glamour 1
of 1
boyhood 1
Not 1
one 1
blossom 1
of 1
his 1
loveliness 1
would 1
ever 1
fade 1
Not 1
one 1
pulse 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
would 1
ever 1
weaken 1
Like 1
the 1
gods 1
of 1
the 1
Greeks 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
strong 1
and 1
fleet 1
and 1
joyous 1
What 1
did 1
it 1
matter 1
what 1
happened 1
to 1
the 1
coloured 1
image 1
on 1
the 1
canvas 1
He 1
would 1
be 1
safe 1
That 1
was 1
everything 1
He 1
drew 1
the 1
screen 1
back 1
into 1
its 1
former 1
place 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
picture 1
smiling 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
so 1
and 1
passed 1
into 1
his 1
bedroom 1
where 1
his 1
valet 1
was 1
already 1
waiting 1
for 1
him 1
An 1
hour 1
later 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
opera 1
and 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
was 1
leaning 1
over 1
his 1
chair 1
CHAPTER 1
As 1
he 1
was 1
sitting 1
at 1
breakfast 1
next 1
morning 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
was 1
shown 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
glad 1
I 1
have 1
found 1
you 1
Dorian 1
he 1
said 1
gravely 1
I 1
called 1
last 1
night 1
and 1
they 1
told 1
me 1
you 1
were 1
at 1
the 1
opera 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
was 1
impossible 1
But 1
I 1
wish 1
you 1
had 1
left 1
word 1
where 1
you 1
had 1
really 1
gone 1
to 1
I 1
passed 1
a 1
dreadful 1
evening 1
half 1
afraid 1
that 1
one 1
tragedy 1
might 1
be 1
followed 1
by 1
another 1
I 1
think 1
you 1
might 1
have 1
telegraphed 1
for 1
me 1
when 1
you 1
heard 1
of 1
it 1
first 1
I 1
read 1
of 1
it 1
quite 1
by 1
chance 1
in 1
a 1
late 1
edition 1
of 1
The 1
Globe 1
that 1
I 1
picked 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
club 1
I 1
came 1
here 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
was 1
miserable 1
at 1
not 1
finding 1
you 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
tell 1
you 1
how 1
heart 1
broken 1
I 1
am 1
about 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
I 1
know 1
what 1
you 1
must 1
suffer 1
But 1
where 1
were 1
you 1
Did 1
you 1
go 1
down 1
and 1
see 1
the 1
girl 1
s 1
mother 1
For 1
a 1
moment 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
following 1
you 1
there 1
They 1
gave 1
the 1
address 1
in 1
the 1
paper 1
Somewhere 1
in 1
the 1
Euston 1
Road 1
isn 1
t 1
it 1
But 1
I 1
was 1
afraid 1
of 1
intruding 1
upon 1
a 1
sorrow 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
lighten 1
Poor 1
woman 1
What 1
a 1
state 1
she 1
must 1
be 1
in 1
And 1
her 1
only 1
child 1
too 1
What 1
did 1
she 1
say 1
about 1
it 1
all 1
My 1
dear 1
Basil 1
how 1
do 1
I 1
know 1
murmured 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
sipping 1
some 1
pale 1
yellow 1
wine 1
from 1
a 1
delicate 1
gold 1
beaded 1
bubble 1
of 1
Venetian 1
glass 1
and 1
looking 1
dreadfully 1
bored 1
I 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
opera 1
You 1
should 1
have 1
come 1
on 1
there 1
I 1
met 1
Lady 1
Gwendolen 1
Harry 1
s 1
sister 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
We 1
were 1
in 1
her 1
box 1
She 1
is 1
perfectly 1
charming 1
and 1
Patti 1
sang 1
divinely 1
Don 1
t 1
talk 1
about 1
horrid 1
subjects 1
If 1
one 1
doesn 1
t 1
talk 1
about 1
a 1
thing 1
it 1
has 1
never 1
happened 1
It 1
is 1
simply 1
expression 1
as 1
Harry 1
says 1
that 1
gives 1
reality 1
to 1
things 1
I 1
may 1
mention 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
woman 1
s 1
only 1
child 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
son 1
a 1
charming 1
fellow 1
I 1
believe 1
But 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
on 1
the 1
stage 1
He 1
is 1
a 1
sailor 1
or 1
something 1
And 1
now 1
tell 1
me 1
about 1
yourself 1
and 1
what 1
you 1
are 1
painting 1
You 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
opera 1
said 1
Hallward 1
speaking 1
very 1
slowly 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
strained 1
touch 1
of 1
pain 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
You 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
opera 1
while 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
was 1
lying 1
dead 1
in 1
some 1
sordid 1
lodging 1
You 1
can 1
talk 1
to 1
me 1
of 1
other 1
women 1
being 1
charming 1
and 1
of 1
Patti 1
singing 1
divinely 1
before 1
the 1
girl 1
you 1
loved 1
has 1
even 1
the 1
quiet 1
of 1
a 1
grave 1
to 1
sleep 1
in 1
Why 1
man 1
there 1
are 1
horrors 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
that 1
little 1
white 1
body 1
of 1
hers 1
Stop 1
Basil 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
hear 1
it 1
cried 1
Dorian 1
leaping 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
You 1
must 1
not 1
tell 1
me 1
about 1
things 1
What 1
is 1
done 1
is 1
done 1
What 1
is 1
past 1
is 1
past 1
You 1
call 1
yesterday 1
the 1
past 1
What 1
has 1
the 1
actual 1
lapse 1
of 1
time 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
It 1
is 1
only 1
shallow 1
people 1
who 1
require 1
years 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
an 1
emotion 1
A 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
master 1
of 1
himself 1
can 1
end 1
a 1
sorrow 1
as 1
easily 1
as 1
he 1
can 1
invent 1
a 1
pleasure 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
the 1
mercy 1
of 1
my 1
emotions 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
use 1
them 1
to 1
enjoy 1
them 1
and 1
to 1
dominate 1
them 1
Dorian 1
this 1
is 1
horrible 1
Something 1
has 1
changed 1
you 1
completely 1
You 1
look 1
exactly 1
the 1
same 1
wonderful 1
boy 1
who 1
day 1
after 1
day 1
used 1
to 1
come 1
down 1
to 1
my 1
studio 1
to 1
sit 1
for 1
his 1
picture 1
But 1
you 1
were 1
simple 1
natural 1
and 1
affectionate 1
then 1
You 1
were 1
the 1
most 1
unspoiled 1
creature 1
in 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
Now 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
has 1
come 1
over 1
you 1
You 1
talk 1
as 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
no 1
heart 1
no 1
pity 1
in 1
you 1
It 1
is 1
all 1
Harry 1
s 1
influence 1
I 1
see 1
that 1
The 1
lad 1
flushed 1
up 1
and 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
looked 1
out 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
on 1
the 1
green 1
flickering 1
sun 1
lashed 1
garden 1
I 1
owe 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
to 1
Harry 1
Basil 1
he 1
said 1
at 1
last 1
more 1
than 1
I 1
owe 1
to 1
you 1
You 1
only 1
taught 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
vain 1
Well 1
I 1
am 1
punished 1
for 1
that 1
Dorian 1
or 1
shall 1
be 1
some 1
day 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
you 1
mean 1
Basil 1
he 1
exclaimed 1
turning 1
round 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
you 1
want 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
I 1
want 1
the 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
I 1
used 1
to 1
paint 1
said 1
the 1
artist 1
sadly 1
Basil 1
said 1
the 1
lad 1
going 1
over 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
putting 1
his 1
hand 1
on 1
his 1
shoulder 1
you 1
have 1
come 1
too 1
late 1
Yesterday 1
when 1
I 1
heard 1
that 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
had 1
killed 1
herself 1
Killed 1
herself 1
Good 1
heavens 1
is 1
there 1
no 1
doubt 1
about 1
that 1
cried 1
Hallward 1
looking 1
up 1
at 1
him 1
with 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
horror 1
My 1
dear 1
Basil 1
Surely 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
vulgar 1
accident 1
Of 1
course 1
she 1
killed 1
herself 1
The 1
elder 1
man 1
buried 1
his 1
face 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
How 1
fearful 1
he 1
muttered 1
and 1
a 1
shudder 1
ran 1
through 1
him 1
No 1
said 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
fearful 1
about 1
it 1
It 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
romantic 1
tragedies 1
of 1
the 1
age 1
As 1
a 1
rule 1
people 1
who 1
act 1
lead 1
the 1
most 1
commonplace 1
lives 1
They 1
are 1
good 1
husbands 1
or 1
faithful 1
wives 1
or 1
something 1
tedious 1
You 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
mean 1
middle 1
class 1
virtue 1
and 1
all 1
that 1
kind 1
of 1
thing 1
How 1
different 1
Sibyl 1
was 1
She 1
lived 1
her 1
finest 1
tragedy 1
She 1
was 1
always 1
a 1
heroine 1
The 1
last 1
night 1
she 1
played 1
the 1
night 1
you 1
saw 1
her 1
she 1
acted 1
badly 1
because 1
she 1
had 1
known 1
the 1
reality 1
of 1
love 1
When 1
she 1
knew 1
its 1
unreality 1
she 1
died 1
as 1
Juliet 1
might 1
have 1
died 1
She 1
passed 1
again 1
into 1
the 1
sphere 1
of 1
art 1
There 1
is 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
martyr 1
about 1
her 1
Her 1
death 1
has 1
all 1
the 1
pathetic 1
uselessness 1
of 1
martyrdom 1
all 1
its 1
wasted 1
beauty 1
But 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
saying 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
think 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
suffered 1
If 1
you 1
had 1
come 1
in 1
yesterday 1
at 1
a 1
particular 1
moment 1
about 1
half 1
past 1
five 1
perhaps 1
or 1
a 1
quarter 1
to 1
six 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
found 1
me 1
in 1
tears 1
Even 1
Harry 1
who 1
was 1
here 1
who 1
brought 1
me 1
the 1
news 1
in 1
fact 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
what 1
I 1
was 1
going 1
through 1
I 1
suffered 1
immensely 1
Then 1
it 1
passed 1
away 1
I 1
cannot 1
repeat 1
an 1
emotion 1
No 1
one 1
can 1
except 1
sentimentalists 1
And 1
you 1
are 1
awfully 1
unjust 1
Basil 1
You 1
come 1
down 1
here 1
to 1
console 1
me 1
That 1
is 1
charming 1
of 1
you 1
You 1
find 1
me 1
consoled 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
furious 1
How 1
like 1
a 1
sympathetic 1
person 1
You 1
remind 1
me 1
of 1
a 1
story 1
Harry 1
told 1
me 1
about 1
a 1
certain 1
philanthropist 1
who 1
spent 1
twenty 1
years 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
in 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
some 1
grievance 1
redressed 1
or 1
some 1
unjust 1
law 1
altered 1
I 1
forget 1
exactly 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
Finally 1
he 1
succeeded 1
and 1
nothing 1
could 1
exceed 1
his 1
disappointment 1
He 1
had 1
absolutely 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
almost 1
died 1
of 1
ennui 1
and 1
became 1
a 1
confirmed 1
misanthrope 1
And 1
besides 1
my 1
dear 1
old 1
Basil 1
if 1
you 1
really 1
want 1
to 1
console 1
me 1
teach 1
me 1
rather 1
to 1
forget 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
or 1
to 1
see 1
it 1
from 1
a 1
proper 1
artistic 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
Was 1
it 1
not 1
Gautier 1
who 1
used 1
to 1
write 1
about 1
la 1
consolation 1
des 1
arts 1
I 1
remember 1
picking 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
vellum 1
covered 1
book 1
in 1
your 1
studio 1
one 1
day 1
and 1
chancing 1
on 1
that 1
delightful 1
phrase 1
Well 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
like 1
that 1
young 1
man 1
you 1
told 1
me 1
of 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
down 1
at 1
Marlow 1
together 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
who 1
used 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
yellow 1
satin 1
could 1
console 1
one 1
for 1
all 1
the 1
miseries 1
of 1
life 1
I 1
love 1
beautiful 1
things 1
that 1
one 1
can 1
touch 1
and 1
handle 1
Old 1
brocades 1
green 1
bronzes 1
lacquer 1
work 1
carved 1
ivories 1
exquisite 1
surroundings 1
luxury 1
pomp 1
there 1
is 1
much 1
to 1
be 1
got 1
from 1
all 1
these 1
But 1
the 1
artistic 1
temperament 1
that 1
they 1
create 1
or 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
reveal 1
is 1
still 1
more 1
to 1
me 1
To 1
become 1
the 1
spectator 1
of 1
one 1
s 1
own 1
life 1
as 1
Harry 1
says 1
is 1
to 1
escape 1
the 1
suffering 1
of 1
life 1
I 1
know 1
you 1
are 1
surprised 1
at 1
my 1
talking 1
to 1
you 1
like 1
this 1
You 1
have 1
not 1
realized 1
how 1
I 1
have 1
developed 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
schoolboy 1
when 1
you 1
knew 1
me 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
man 1
now 1
I 1
have 1
new 1
passions 1
new 1
thoughts 1
new 1
ideas 1
I 1
am 1
different 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
like 1
me 1
less 1
I 1
am 1
changed 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
always 1
be 1
my 1
friend 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
Harry 1
But 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
better 1
than 1
he 1
is 1
You 1
are 1
not 1
stronger 1
you 1
are 1
too 1
much 1
afraid 1
of 1
life 1
but 1
you 1
are 1
better 1
And 1
how 1
happy 1
we 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
together 1
Don 1
t 1
leave 1
me 1
Basil 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
quarrel 1
with 1
me 1
I 1
am 1
what 1
I 1
am 1
There 1
is 1
nothing 1
more 1
to 1
be 1
said 1
The 1
painter 1
felt 1
strangely 1
moved 1
The 1
lad 1
was 1
infinitely 1
dear 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
his 1
personality 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
great 1
turning 1
point 1
in 1
his 1
art 1
He 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
reproaching 1
him 1
any 1
more 1
After 1
all 1
his 1
indifference 1
was 1
probably 1
merely 1
a 1
mood 1
that 1
would 1
pass 1
away 1
There 1
was 1
so 1
much 1
in 1
him 1
that 1
was 1
good 1
so 1
much 1
in 1
him 1
that 1
was 1
noble 1
Well 1
Dorian 1
he 1
said 1
at 1
length 1
with 1
a 1
sad 1
smile 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
speak 1
to 1
you 1
again 1
about 1
this 1
horrible 1
thing 1
after 1
to 1
day 1
I 1
only 1
trust 1
your 1
name 1
won 1
t 1
be 1
mentioned 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
it 1
The 1
inquest 1
is 1
to 1
take 1
place 1
this 1
afternoon 1
Have 1
they 1
summoned 1
you 1
Dorian 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
annoyance 1
passed 1
over 1
his 1
face 1
at 1
the 1
mention 1
of 1
the 1
word 1
inquest 1
There 1
was 1
something 1
so 1
crude 1
and 1
vulgar 1
about 1
everything 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
They 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
my 1
name 1
he 1
answered 1
But 1
surely 1
she 1
did 1
Only 1
my 1
Christian 1
name 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
quite 1
sure 1
she 1
never 1
mentioned 1
to 1
any 1
one 1
She 1
told 1
me 1
once 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
rather 1
curious 1
to 1
learn 1
who 1
I 1
was 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
invariably 1
told 1
them 1
my 1
name 1
was 1
Prince 1
Charming 1
It 1
was 1
pretty 1
of 1
her 1
You 1
must 1
do 1
me 1
a 1
drawing 1
of 1
Sibyl 1
Basil 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
have 1
something 1
more 1
of 1
her 1
than 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
a 1
few 1
kisses 1
and 1
some 1
broken 1
pathetic 1
words 1
I 1
will 1
try 1
and 1
do 1
something 1
Dorian 1
if 1
it 1
would 1
please 1
you 1
But 1
you 1
must 1
come 1
and 1
sit 1
to 1
me 1
yourself 1
again 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
get 1
on 1
without 1
you 1
I 1
can 1
never 1
sit 1
to 1
you 1
again 1
Basil 1
It 1
is 1
impossible 1
he 1
exclaimed 1
starting 1
back 1
The 1
painter 1
stared 1
at 1
him 1
My 1
dear 1
boy 1
what 1
nonsense 1
he 1
cried 1
Do 1
you 1
mean 1
to 1
say 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
what 1
I 1
did 1
of 1
you 1
Where 1
is 1
it 1
Why 1
have 1
you 1
pulled 1
the 1
screen 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
it 1
Let 1
me 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
best 1
thing 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
done 1
Do 1
take 1
the 1
screen 1
away 1
Dorian 1
It 1
is 1
simply 1
disgraceful 1
of 1
your 1
servant 1
hiding 1
my 1
work 1
like 1
that 1
I 1
felt 1
the 1
room 1
looked 1
different 1
as 1
I 1
came 1
in 1
My 1
servant 1
has 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
Basil 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
imagine 1
I 1
let 1
him 1
arrange 1
my 1
room 1
for 1
me 1
He 1
settles 1
my 1
flowers 1
for 1
me 1
sometimes 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
No 1
I 1
did 1
it 1
myself 1
The 1
light 1
was 1
too 1
strong 1
on 1
the 1
portrait 1
Too 1
strong 1
Surely 1
not 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
It 1
is 1
an 1
admirable 1
place 1
for 1
it 1
Let 1
me 1
see 1
it 1
And 1
Hallward 1
walked 1
towards 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
A 1
cry 1
of 1
terror 1
broke 1
from 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
s 1
lips 1
and 1
he 1
rushed 1
between 1
the 1
painter 1
and 1
the 1
screen 1
Basil 1
he 1
said 1
looking 1
very 1
pale 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
wish 1
you 1
to 1
Not 1
look 1
at 1
my 1
own 1
work 1
You 1
are 1
not 1
serious 1
Why 1
shouldn 1
t 1
I 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
exclaimed 1
Hallward 1
laughing 1
If 1
you 1
try 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
Basil 1
on 1
my 1
word 1
of 1
honour 1
I 1
will 1
never 1
speak 1
to 1
you 1
again 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
I 1
live 1
I 1
am 1
quite 1
serious 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
offer 1
any 1
explanation 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
to 1
ask 1
for 1
any 1
But 1
remember 1
if 1
you 1
touch 1
this 1
screen 1
everything 1
is 1
over 1
between 1
us 1
Hallward 1
was 1
thunderstruck 1
He 1
looked 1
at 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
in 1
absolute 1
amazement 1
He 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
him 1
like 1
this 1
before 1
The 1
lad 1
was 1
actually 1
pallid 1
with 1
rage 1
His 1
hands 1
were 1
clenched 1
and 1
the 1
pupils 1
of 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
like 1
disks 1
of 1
blue 1
fire 1
He 1
was 1
trembling 1
all 1
over 1
Dorian 1
Don 1
t 1
speak 1
But 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
matter 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
if 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
me 1
to 1
he 1
said 1
rather 1
coldly 1
turning 1
on 1
his 1
heel 1
and 1
going 1
over 1
towards 1
the 1
window 1
But 1
really 1
it 1
seems 1
rather 1
absurd 1
that 1
I 1
shouldn 1
t 1
see 1
my 1
own 1
work 1
especially 1
as 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
exhibit 1
it 1
in 1
Paris 1
in 1
the 1
autumn 1
I 1
shall 1
probably 1
have 1
to 1
give 1
it 1
another 1
coat 1
of 1
varnish 1
before 1
that 1
so 1
I 1
must 1
see 1
it 1
some 1
day 1
and 1
why 1
not 1
to 1
day 1
To 1
exhibit 1
it 1
You 1
want 1
to 1
exhibit 1
it 1
exclaimed 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
a 1
strange 1
sense 1
of 1
terror 1
creeping 1
over 1
him 1
Was 1
the 1
world 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
shown 1
his 1
secret 1
Were 1
people 1
to 1
gape 1
at 1
the 1
mystery 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
That 1
was 1
impossible 1
Something 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
at 1
once 1
Yes 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
suppose 1
you 1
will 1
object 1
to 1
that 1
Georges 1
Petit 1
is 1
going 1
to 1
collect 1
all 1
my 1
best 1
pictures 1
for 1
a 1
special 1
exhibition 1
in 1
the 1
Rue 1
de 1
Seze 1
which 1
will 1
open 1
the 1
first 1
week 1
in 1
October 1
The 1
portrait 1
will 1
only 1
be 1
away 1
a 1
month 1
I 1
should 1
think 1
you 1
could 1
easily 1
spare 1
it 1
for 1
that 1
time 1
In 1
fact 1
you 1
are 1
sure 1
to 1
be 1
out 1
of 1
town 1
And 1
if 1
you 1
keep 1
it 1
always 1
behind 1
a 1
screen 1
you 1
can 1
t 1
care 1
much 1
about 1
it 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
passed 1
his 1
hand 1
over 1
his 1
forehead 1
There 1
were 1
beads 1
of 1
perspiration 1
there 1
He 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
brink 1
of 1
a 1
horrible 1
danger 1
You 1
told 1
me 1
a 1
month 1
ago 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
never 1
exhibit 1
it 1
he 1
cried 1
Why 1
have 1
you 1
changed 1
your 1
mind 1
You 1
people 1
who 1
go 1
in 1
for 1
being 1
consistent 1
have 1
just 1
as 1
many 1
moods 1
as 1
others 1
have 1
The 1
only 1
difference 1
is 1
that 1
your 1
moods 1
are 1
rather 1
meaningless 1
You 1
can 1
t 1
have 1
forgotten 1
that 1
you 1
assured 1
me 1
most 1
solemnly 1
that 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
would 1
induce 1
you 1
to 1
send 1
it 1
to 1
any 1
exhibition 1
You 1
told 1
Harry 1
exactly 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
He 1
stopped 1
suddenly 1
and 1
a 1
gleam 1
of 1
light 1
came 1
into 1
his 1
eyes 1
He 1
remembered 1
that 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
had 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
once 1
half 1
seriously 1
and 1
half 1
in 1
jest 1
If 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
strange 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
get 1
Basil 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
why 1
he 1
won 1
t 1
exhibit 1
your 1
picture 1
He 1
told 1
me 1
why 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
revelation 1
to 1
me 1
Yes 1
perhaps 1
Basil 1
too 1
had 1
his 1
secret 1
He 1
would 1
ask 1
him 1
and 1
try 1
Basil 1
he 1
said 1
coming 1
over 1
quite 1
close 1
and 1
looking 1
him 1
straight 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
we 1
have 1
each 1
of 1
us 1
a 1
secret 1
Let 1
me 1
know 1
yours 1
and 1
I 1
shall 1
tell 1
you 1
mine 1
What 1
was 1
your 1
reason 1
for 1
refusing 1
to 1
exhibit 1
my 1
picture 1
The 1
painter 1
shuddered 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
himself 1
Dorian 1
if 1
I 1
told 1
you 2
might 1
like 1
me 1
less 1
than 1
you 1
do 1
and 1
you 1
would 1
certainly 1
laugh 1
at 1
me 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
your 1
doing 1
either 1
of 1
those 1
two 1
things 1
If 1
you 1
wish 1
me 1
never 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
your 1
picture 1
again 1
I 1
am 1
content 1
I 1
have 1
always 1
you 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
If 1
you 1
wish 1
the 1
best 1
work 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
done 1
to 1
be 1
hidden 1
from 1
the 1
world 1
I 1
am 1
satisfied 1
Your 1
friendship 1
is 1
dearer 1
to 1
me 1
than 1
any 1
fame 1
or 1
reputation 1
No 1
Basil 1
you 1
must 1
tell 1
me 1
insisted 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
I 1
think 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
know 1
His 1
feeling 1
of 1
terror 1
had 1
passed 1
away 1
and 1
curiosity 1
had 1
taken 1
its 1
place 1
He 1
was 1
determined 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
s 1
mystery 1
Let 1
us 1
sit 1
down 1
Dorian 1
said 1
the 1
painter 1
looking 1
troubled 1
Let 1
us 1
sit 1
down 1
And 1
just 1
answer 1
me 1
one 1
question 1
Have 1
you 1
noticed 1
in 1
the 1
picture 1
something 1
curious 1
something 1
that 1
probably 1
at 1
first 1
did 1
not 1
strike 1
you 1
but 1
that 1
revealed 1
itself 1
to 1
you 1
suddenly 1
Basil 1
cried 1
the 1
lad 1
clutching 1
the 1
arms 1
of 1
his 1
chair 1
with 1
trembling 1
hands 1
and 1
gazing 1
at 1
him 1
with 1
wild 1
startled 1
eyes 1
I 1
see 1
you 1
did 1
Don 1
t 1
speak 1
Wait 1
till 1
you 1
hear 1
what 1
I 1
have 1
to 1
say 1
Dorian 1
from 1
the 1
moment 1
I 1
met 1
you 1
your 1
personality 1
had 1
the 1
most 1
extraordinary 1
influence 1
over 1
me 1
I 1
was 1
dominated 1
soul 1
brain 1
and 1
power 1
by 1
you 1
You 1
became 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
visible 1
incarnation 1
of 1
that 1
unseen 1
ideal 1
whose 1
memory 1
haunts 1
us 1
artists 1
like 1
an 1
exquisite 1
dream 1
I 1
worshipped 1
you 1
I 1
grew 1
jealous 1
of 1
every 1
one 1
to 1
whom 1
you 1
spoke 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
have 1
you 1
all 1
to 1
myself 1
I 1
was 1
only 1
happy 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
with 1
you 1
When 1
you 1
were 1
away 1
from 1
me 1
you 1
were 1
still 1
present 1
in 1
my 1
art 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
never 1
let 1
you 1
know 1
anything 1
about 1
this 1
It 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
impossible 1
You 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
understood 1
it 1
I 1
hardly 1
understood 1
it 1
myself 1
I 1
only 1
knew 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
seen 1
perfection 1
face 1
to 1
face 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
world 1
had 1
become 1
wonderful 1
to 1
my 1
eyes 1
too 1
wonderful 1
perhaps 1
for 1
in 1
such 1
mad 1
worships 1
there 1
is 1
peril 1
the 1
peril 1
of 1
losing 1
them 1
no 1
less 1
than 1
the 1
peril 1
of 1
keeping 1
them 1
Weeks 1
and 1
weeks 1
went 1
on 1
and 1
I 1
grew 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
absorbed 1
in 1
you 1
Then 1
came 1
a 1
new 1
development 1
I 1
had 1
drawn 1
you 1
as 1
Paris 1
in 1
dainty 1
armour 1
and 1
as 1
Adonis 1
with 1
huntsman 1
s 1
cloak 1
and 1
polished 1
boar 1
spear 1
Crowned 1
with 1
heavy 1
lotus 1
blossoms 1
you 1
had 1
sat 1
on 1
the 1
prow 1
of 1
Adrian 1
s 1
barge 1
gazing 1
across 1
the 1
green 1
turbid 1
Nile 1
You 1
had 1
leaned 1
over 1
the 1
still 1
pool 1
of 1
some 1
Greek 1
woodland 1
and 1
seen 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
s 1
silent 1
silver 1
the 1
marvel 1
of 1
your 1
own 1
face 1
And 1
it 1
had 1
all 1
been 1
what 1
art 1
should 1
be 1
unconscious 1
ideal 1
and 1
remote 1
One 1
day 1
a 1
fatal 1
day 1
I 1
sometimes 1
think 1
I 1
determined 1
to 1
paint 1
a 1
wonderful 1
portrait 1
of 1
you 1
as 1
you 1
actually 1
are 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
costume 1
of 1
dead 1
ages 1
but 1
in 1
your 1
own 1
dress 1
and 1
in 1
your 1
own 1
time 1
Whether 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
realism 1
of 1
the 1
method 1
or 1
the 1
mere 1
wonder 1
of 1
your 1
own 1
personality 1
thus 1
directly 1
presented 1
to 1
me 1
without 1
mist 1
or 1
veil 1
I 1
cannot 1
tell 1
But 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
as 1
I 1
worked 1
at 1
it 1
every 1
flake 1
and 1
film 1
of 1
colour 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
reveal 1
my 1
secret 1
I 1
grew 1
afraid 1
that 1
others 1
would 1
know 1
of 1
my 1
idolatry 1
I 1
felt 1
Dorian 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
told 1
too 1
much 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
put 1
too 1
much 1
of 1
myself 1
into 1
it 1
Then 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
I 1
resolved 1
never 1
to 1
allow 1
the 1
picture 1
to 1
be 1
exhibited 1
You 1
were 1
a 1
little 1
annoyed 1
but 1
then 1
you 1
did 1
not 1
realize 1
all 1
that 1
it 1
meant 1
to 1
me 1
Harry 1
to 1
whom 1
I 1
talked 1
about 1
it 1
laughed 1
at 1
me 1
But 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
mind 1
that 1
When 1
the 1
picture 1
was 1
finished 1
and 1
I 1
sat 1
alone 1
with 1
it 1
I 1
felt 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
right 1
Well 1
after 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
the 1
thing 1
left 1
my 1
studio 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
I 1
had 1
got 1
rid 1
of 1
the 1
intolerable 1
fascination 1
of 1
its 1
presence 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
foolish 1
in 1
imagining 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
seen 1
anything 1
in 1
it 1
more 1
than 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
extremely 1
good 1
looking 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
paint 1
Even 1
now 1
I 1
cannot 1
help 1
feeling 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
mistake 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
the 1
passion 1
one 1
feels 1
in 1
creation 1
is 1
ever 1
really 1
shown 1
in 1
the 1
work 1
one 1
creates 1
Art 1
is 1
always 1
more 1
abstract 1
than 1
we 1
fancy 1
Form 1
and 1
colour 1
tell 1
us 1
of 1
form 1
and 1
colour 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
It 1
often 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
art 1
conceals 1
the 1
artist 1
far 1
more 1
completely 1
than 1
it 1
ever 1
reveals 1
him 1
And 1
so 1
when 1
I 1
got 1
this 1
offer 1
from 1
Paris 1
I 1
determined 1
to 1
make 1
your 1
portrait 1
the 1
principal 1
thing 1
in 1
my 1
exhibition 1
It 1
never 1
occurred 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
refuse 1
I 1
see 1
now 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
right 1
The 1
picture 1
cannot 1
be 1
shown 1
You 1
must 1
not 1
be 1
angry 1
with 1
me 1
Dorian 1
for 1
what 1
I 1
have 1
told 1
you 1
As 1
I 1
said 1
to 1
Harry 1
once 1
you 1
are 1
made 1
to 1
be 1
worshipped 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
drew 1
a 1
long 1
breath 1
The 1
colour 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
cheeks 1
and 1
a 1
smile 1
played 1
about 1
his 1
lips 1
The 1
peril 1
was 1
over 1
He 1
was 1
safe 1
for 1
the 1
time 1
Yet 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
feeling 1
infinite 1
pity 1
for 1
the 1
painter 1
who 1
had 1
just 1
made 1
this 1
strange 1
confession 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
wondered 1
if 1
he 1
himself 1
would 1
ever 1
be 1
so 1
dominated 1
by 1
the 1
personality 1
of 1
a 1
friend 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
had 1
the 1
charm 1
of 1
being 1
very 1
dangerous 1
But 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
He 1
was 1
too 1
clever 1
and 1
too 1
cynical 1
to 1
be 1
really 1
fond 1
of 1
Would 1
there 1
ever 1
be 1
some 1
one 1
who 1
would 1
fill 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
strange 1
idolatry 1
Was 1
that 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
things 1
that 1
life 1
had 1
in 1
store 1
It 1
is 1
extraordinary 1
to 1
me 1
Dorian 1
said 1
Hallward 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
seen 1
this 1
in 1
the 1
portrait 1
Did 1
you 1
really 1
see 1
it 1
I 1
saw 1
something 1
in 1
it 1
he 1
answered 1
something 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
very 1
curious 1
Well 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
mind 1
my 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
thing 1
now 1
Dorian 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
You 1
must 1
not 1
ask 1
me 1
that 1
Basil 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
possibly 1
let 1
you 1
stand 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
that 1
picture 1
You 1
will 1
some 1
day 1
surely 1
Never 1
Well 1
perhaps 1
you 1
are 1
right 1
And 1
now 1
good 1
bye 1
Dorian 1
You 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
one 1
person 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
who 1
has 1
really 1
influenced 1
my 1
art 1
Whatever 1
I 1
have 1
done 1
that 1
is 1
good 1
I 1
owe 1
to 1
you 1
Ah 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
it 1
cost 1
me 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
all 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
told 1
you 1
My 1
dear 1
Basil 1
said 1
Dorian 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
told 1
me 1
Simply 1
that 1
you 1
felt 1
that 1
you 1
admired 1
me 1
too 1
much 1
That 1
is 1
not 1
even 1
a 1
compliment 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
intended 1
as 1
a 1
compliment 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
confession 1
Now 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
made 1
it 1
something 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
gone 1
out 1
of 1
me 1
Perhaps 1
one 1
should 1
never 1
put 1
one 1
s 1
worship 1
into 1
words 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
disappointing 1
confession 1
Why 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
expect 1
Dorian 1
You 1
didn 1
t 1
see 1
anything 1
else 1
in 1
the 1
picture 1
did 1
you 1
There 1
was 1
nothing 1
else 1
to 1
see 1
No 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
else 1
to 1
see 1
Why 1
do 1
you 1
ask 1
But 1
you 1
mustn 1
t 1
talk 1
about 1
worship 1
It 1
is 1
foolish 1
You 1
and 1
I 1
are 1
friends 1
Basil 1
and 1
we 1
must 1
always 1
remain 1
so 1
You 1
have 1
got 1
Harry 1
said 1
the 1
painter 1
sadly 1
Oh 1
Harry 1
cried 1
the 1
lad 1
with 1
a 1
ripple 1
of 1
laughter 1
Harry 1
spends 1
his 1
days 1
in 1
saying 1
what 1
is 1
incredible 1
and 1
his 1
evenings 1
in 1
doing 1
what 1
is 1
improbable 1
Just 1
the 1
sort 1
of 1
life 1
I 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
lead 1
But 1
still 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
I 1
would 1
go 1
to 1
Harry 1
if 1
I 1
were 1
in 1
trouble 1
I 1
would 1
sooner 1
go 1
to 1
you 1
Basil 1
You 1
will 1
sit 1
to 1
me 1
again 1
Impossible 1
You 1
spoil 1
my 1
life 1
as 1
an 1

No 1
man 1
comes 1
across 1
two 1
ideal 1
things 1
Few 1
come 1
across 1
one 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
explain 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
Basil 1
but 1
I 1
must 1
never 1
sit 1
to 1
you 1
again 1
There 1
is 1
something 1
fatal 1
about 1
a 1
portrait 1
It 1
has 1
a 1
life 1
of 1
its 1
own 1
I 1
will 1
come 1
and 1
have 1
tea 1
with 1
you 1
That 1
will 1
be 1
just 1
as 1
pleasant 1
Pleasanter 1
for 1
you 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
murmured 1
Hallward 1
regretfully 1
And 1
now 1
good 1
bye 1
I 1
am 1
sorry 1
you 1
won 1
t 1
let 1
me 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
picture 1
once 1
again 1
But 1
that 1
can 1
t 1
be 1
helped 1
I 1
quite 1
understand 1
what 1
you 1
feel 1
about 1
it 1
As 1
he 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
smiled 1
to 1
himself 1
Poor 1
Basil 1
How 1
little 1
he 1
knew 1
of 1
the 1
true 1
reason 1
And 1
how 1
strange 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
instead 1
of 1
having 1
been 1
forced 1
to 1
reveal 1
his 1
own 1
secret 1
he 1
had 1
succeeded 1
almost 1
by 1
chance 1
in 1
wresting 1
a 1
secret 1
from 1
his 1
friend 1
How 1
much 1
that 1
strange 1
confession 1
explained 1
to 1
him 1
The 1
painter 1
s 1
absurd 1
fits 1
of 1
jealousy 1
his 1
wild 1
devotion 1
his 1
extravagant 1
panegyrics 1
his 1
curious 1
reticences 1
he 1
understood 1
them 1
all 1
now 1
and 1
he 1
felt 1
sorry 1
There 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
something 1
tragic 1
in 1
a 1
friendship 1
so 1
coloured 1
by 1
romance 1
He 1
sighed 1
and 1
touched 1
the 1
bell 1
The 1
portrait 1
must 1
be 1
hidden 1
away 1
at 1
all 1
costs 1
He 1
could 1
not 1
run 1
such 1
a 1
risk 1
of 1
discovery 1
again 1
It 1
had 1
been 1
mad 1
of 1
him 1
to 1
have 1
allowed 1
the 1
thing 1
to 1
remain 1
even 1
for 1
an 1
hour 1
in 1
a 1
room 1
to 1
which 1
any 1
of 1
his 1
friends 1
had 1
access 1
CHAPTER 1
When 1
his 1
servant 1
entered 1
he 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
steadfastly 1
and 1
wondered 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
thought 1
of 1
peering 1
behind 1
the 1
screen 1
The 1
man 1
was 1
quite 1
impassive 1
and 1
waited 1
for 1
his 1
orders 1
Dorian 1
lit 1
a 1
cigarette 1
and 1
walked 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
glass 1
and 1
glanced 1
into 1
it 1
He 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
reflection 1
of 1
Victor 1
s 1
face 1
perfectly 1
It 1
was 1
like 1
a 1
placid 1
mask 1
of 1
servility 1
There 1
was 1
nothing 1
to 1
be 1
afraid 1
of 1
there 1
Yet 1
he 1
thought 1
it 1
best 1
to 1
be 1
on 1
his 1
guard 1
Speaking 1
very 1
slowly 1
he 1
told 1
him 1
to 1
tell 1
the 1
house 1
keeper 1
that 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
frame 1
maker 1
and 1
ask 1
him 1
to 1
send 1
two 1
of 1
his 1
men 1
round 1
at 1
once 1
It 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
as 1
the 1
man 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
his 1
eyes 1
wandered 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
screen 1
Or 1
was 1
that 1
merely 1
his 1
own 1
fancy 1
After 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
in 1
her 1
black 1
silk 1
dress 1
with 1
old 1
fashioned 1
thread 1
mittens 1
on 1
her 1
wrinkled 1
hands 1
Mrs 1
Leaf 1
bustled 1
into 1
the 1
library 1
He 1
asked 1
her 1
for 1
the 1
key 1
of 1
the 1
schoolroom 1
The 1
old 1
schoolroom 1
Mr 1
Dorian 1
she 1
exclaimed 1
Why 1
it 1
is 1
full 1
of 1
dust 1
I 1
must 1
get 1
it 1
arranged 1
and 1
put 1
straight 1
before 1
you 1
go 1
into 1
it 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
fit 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
see 1
sir 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
indeed 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
it 1
put 1
straight 1
Leaf 1
I 1
only 1
want 1
the 1
key 1
Well 1
sir 1
you 1
ll 1
be 1
covered 1
with 1
cobwebs 1
if 1
you 1
go 1
into 1
it 1
Why 1
it 1
hasn 1
t 1
been 1
opened 1
for 1
nearly 1
five 1
years 1
not 1
since 1
his 1
lordship 1
died 1
He 1
winced 1
at 1
the 1
mention 1
of 1
his 1
grandfather 1
He 1
had 1
hateful 1
memories 1
of 1
him 1
That 1
does 1
not 1
matter 1
he 1
answered 1
I 1
simply 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
place 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
Give 1
me 1
the 1
key 1
And 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
key 1
sir 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
going 1
over 1
the 1
contents 1
of 1
her 1
bunch 1
with 1
tremulously 1
uncertain 1
hands 1
Here 1
is 1
the 1
key 1
I 1
ll 1
have 1
it 1
off 1
the 1
bunch 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
But 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
of 1
living 1
up 1
there 1
sir 1
and 1
you 1
so 1
comfortable 1
here 1
No 1
no 1
he 1
cried 1
petulantly 1
Thank 1
you 1
Leaf 1
That 1
will 1
do 1
She 1
lingered 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
and 1
was 1
garrulous 1
over 1
some 1
detail 1
of 1
the 1
household 1
He 1
sighed 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
to 1
manage 1
things 1
as 1
she 1
thought 1
best 1
She 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
wreathed 1
in 1
smiles 1
As 1
the 1
door 1
closed 1
Dorian 1
put 1
the 1
key 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
looked 1
round 1
the 1
room 1
His 1
eye 1
fell 1
on 1
a 1
large 1
purple 1
satin 1
coverlet 1
heavily 1
embroidered 1
with 1
gold 1
a 1
splendid 1
piece 1
of 1
late 1
seventeenth 1
century 1
Venetian 1
work 1
that 1
his 1
grandfather 1
had 1
found 1
in 1
a 1
convent 1
near 1
Bologna 1
Yes 1
that 1
would 1
serve 1
to 1
wrap 1
the 1
dreadful 1
thing 1
in 1
It 1
had 1
perhaps 1
served 1
often 1
as 1
a 1
pall 1
for 1
the 1
dead 1
Now 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
hide 1
something 1
that 1
had 1
a 1
corruption 1
of 1
its 1
own 1
worse 1
than 1
the 1
corruption 1
of 1
death 1
itself 1
something 1
that 1
would 1
breed 1
horrors 1
and 1
yet 1
would 1
never 1
die 1
What 1
the 1
worm 1
was 1
to 1
the 1
corpse 1
his 1
sins 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
the 1
painted 1
image 1
on 1
the 1
canvas 1
They 1
would 1
mar 1
its 1
beauty 1
and 1
eat 1
away 1
its 1
grace 1
They 1
would 1
defile 1
it 1
and 1
make 1
it 1
shameful 1
And 1
yet 1
the 1
thing 1
would 1
still 1
live 1
on 1
It 1
would 1
be 1
always 1
alive 1
He 1
shuddered 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
he 1
regretted 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
told 1
Basil 1
the 1
true 1
reason 1
why 1
he 1
had 1
wished 1
to 1
hide 1
the 1
picture 1
away 1
Basil 1
would 1
have 1
helped 1
him 1
to 1
resist 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
s 1
influence 1
and 1
the 1
still 1
more 1
poisonous 1
influences 1
that 1
came 1
from 1
his 1
own 1
temperament 1
The 1
love 1
that 1
he 1
bore 1
him 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
really 1
love 1
had 1
nothing 1
in 1
it 1
that 1
was 1
not 1
noble 1
and 1
intellectual 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
that 1
mere 1
physical 1
admiration 1
of 1
beauty 1
that 1
is 1
born 1
of 1
the 1
senses 1
and 1
that 1
dies 1
when 1
the 1
senses 1
tire 1
It 1
was 1
such 1
love 1
as 1
Michelangelo 1
had 1
known 1
and 1
Montaigne 1
and 1
Winckelmann 1
and 1
Shakespeare 1
himself 1
Yes 1
Basil 1
could 1
have 1
saved 1
him 1
But 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
late 1
now 1
The 1
past 1
could 1
always 1
be 1
annihilated 1
Regret 1
denial 1
or 1
forgetfulness 1
could 1
do 1
that 1
But 1
the 1
future 1
was 1
inevitable 1
There 1
were 1
passions 1
in 1
him 1
that 1
would 1
find 1
their 1
terrible 1
outlet 1
dreams 1
that 1
would 1
make 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
their 1
evil 1
real 1
He 1
took 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
couch 1
the 1
great 1
purple 1
and 1
gold 1
texture 1
that 1
covered 1
it 1
and 1
holding 1
it 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
passed 1
behind 1
the 1
screen 1
Was 1
the 1
face 1
on 1
the 1
canvas 1
viler 1
than 1
before 1
It 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
unchanged 1
and 1
yet 1
his 1
loathing 1
of 1
it 1
was 1
intensified 1
Gold 1
hair 1
blue 1
eyes 1
and 1
rose 1
red 1
lips 1
they 1
all 1
were 1
there 1
It 1
was 1
simply 1
the 1
expression 1
that 1
had 1
altered 1
That 1
was 1
horrible 1
in 1
its 1
cruelty 1
Compared 1
to 1
what 1
he 1
saw 1
in 1
it 1
of 1
censure 1
or 1
rebuke 1
how 1
shallow 1
Basil 1
s 1
reproaches 1
about 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
had 1
been 1
how 1
shallow 1
and 1
of 1
what 1
little 1
account 1
His 1
own 1
soul 1
was 1
looking 1
out 1
at 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
canvas 1
and 1
calling 1
him 1
to 1
judgement 1
A 1
look 1
of 1
pain 1
came 1
across 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
flung 1
the 1
rich 1
pall 1
over 1
the 1
picture 1
As 1
he 1
did 1
so 1
a 1
knock 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
He 1
passed 1
out 1
as 1
his 1
servant 1
entered 1
The 1
persons 1
are 1
here 1
Monsieur 1
He 1
felt 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
must 1
be 1
got 1
rid 1
of 1
at 1
once 1
He 1
must 1
not 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
know 1
where 1
the 1
picture 1
was 1
being 1
taken 1
to 1
There 1
was 1
something 1
sly 1
about 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
thoughtful 1
treacherous 1
eyes 1
Sitting 1
down 1
at 1
the 1
writing 1
table 1
he 1
scribbled 1
a 1
note 1
to 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
asking 1
him 1
to 1
send 1
him 1
round 1
something 1
to 1
read 1
and 1
reminding 1
him 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
to 1
meet 1
at 1
eight 1
fifteen 1
that 1
evening 1
Wait 1
for 1
an 1
answer 1
he 1
said 1
handing 1
it 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
show 1
the 1
men 1
in 1
here 1
In 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
minutes 1
there 1
was 1
another 1
knock 1
and 1
Mr 1
Hubbard 1
himself 1
the 1
celebrated 1
frame 1
maker 1
of 1
South 1
Audley 1
Street 1
came 1
in 1
with 1
a 1
somewhat 1
rough 1
looking 1
young 1
assistant 1
Mr 1
Hubbard 1
was 1
a 1
florid 1
red 1
whiskered 1
little 1
man 1
whose 1
admiration 1
for 1
art 1
was 1
considerably 1
tempered 1
by 1
the 1
inveterate 1
impecuniosity 1
of 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
artists 1
who 1
dealt 1
with 1
him 1
As 1
a 1
rule 1
he 1
never 1
left 1
his 1
shop 1
He 1
waited 1
for 1
people 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
him 1
But 1
he 1
always 1
made 1
an 1
exception 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
There 1
was 1
something 1
about 1
Dorian 1
that 1
charmed 1
everybody 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
pleasure 1
even 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
What 1
can 1
I 1
do 1
for 1
you 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
he 1
said 1
rubbing 1
his 1
fat 1
freckled 1
hands 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
would 1
do 1
myself 1
the 1
honour 1
of 1
coming 1
round 1
in 1
person 1
I 1
have 1
just 1
got 1
a 1
beauty 1
of 1
a 1
frame 1
sir 1
Picked 1
it 1
up 1
at 1
a 1
sale 1
Old 1
Florentine 1
Came 1
from 1
Fonthill 1
I 1
believe 1
Admirably 1
suited 1
for 1
a 1
religious 1
subject 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
sorry 1
you 1
have 1
given 1
yourself 1
the 1
trouble 1
of 1
coming 1
round 1
Mr 1
Hubbard 1
I 1
shall 1
certainly 1
drop 1
in 1
and 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
frame 1
though 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
go 1
in 1
much 1
at 1
present 1
for 1
religious 1
art 1
but 1
to 1
day 1
I 1
only 1
want 1
a 1
picture 1
carried 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
for 1
me 1
It 1
is 1
rather 1
heavy 1
so 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
would 1
ask 1
you 1
to 1
lend 1
me 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
your 1
men 1
No 1
trouble 1
at 1
all 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
I 1
am 1
delighted 1
to 1
be 1
of 1
any 1
service 1
to 1
you 1
Which 1
is 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
art 1
sir 1
This 1
replied 1
Dorian 1
moving 1
the 1
screen 1
back 1
Can 1
you 1
move 1
it 1
covering 1
and 1
all 1
just 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
it 1
to 1
get 1
scratched 1
going 1
upstairs 1
There 1
will 1
be 1
no 1
difficulty 1
sir 1
said 1
the 1
genial 1
frame 1
maker 1
beginning 1
with 1
the 1
aid 1
of 1
his 1
assistant 1
to 1
unhook 1
the 1
picture 1
from 1
the 1
long 1
brass 1
chains 1
by 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
suspended 1
And 1
now 1
where 1
shall 1
we 1
carry 1
it 1
to 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
I 1
will 1
show 1
you 1
the 1
way 1
Mr 1
Hubbard 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
kindly 1
follow 1
me 1
Or 1
perhaps 1
you 1
had 1
better 1
go 1
in 1
front 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
it 1
is 1
right 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
We 1
will 1
go 1
up 1
by 1
the 1
front 1
staircase 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
wider 1
He 1
held 1
the 1
door 1
open 1
for 1
them 1
and 1
they 1
passed 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
hall 1
and 1
began 1
the 1
ascent 1
The 1
elaborate 1
character 1
of 1
the 1
frame 1
had 1
made 1
the 1
picture 1
extremely 1
bulky 1
and 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
obsequious 1
protests 1
of 1
Mr 1
Hubbard 1
who 1
had 1
the 1
true 1
tradesman 1
s 1
spirited 1
dislike 1
of 1
seeing 1
a 1
gentleman 1
doing 1
anything 1
useful 1
Dorian 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
to 1
it 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
help 1
them 1
Something 1
of 1
a 1
load 1
to 1
carry 1
sir 1
gasped 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
when 1
they 1
reached 1
the 1
top 1
landing 1
And 1
he 1
wiped 1
his 1
shiny 1
forehead 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
it 1
is 1
rather 1
heavy 1
murmured 1
Dorian 1
as 1
he 1
unlocked 1
the 1
door 1
that 1
opened 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
that 1
was 1
to 1
keep 1
for 1
him 1
the 1
curious 1
secret 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
and 1
hide 1
his 1
soul 1
from 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
men 1
He 1
had 1
not 1
entered 1
the 1
place 1
for 1
more 1
than 1
four 1
years 1
not 1
indeed 1
since 1
he 1
had 1
used 1
it 1
first 1
as 1
a 1
play 1
room 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
child 1
and 1
then 1
as 1
a 1
study 1
when 1
he 1
grew 1
somewhat 1
older 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
large 1
well 1
proportioned 1
room 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
specially 1
built 1
by 1
the 1
last 1
Lord 1
Kelso 1
for 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
grandson 1
whom 1
for 1
his 1
strange 1
likeness 1
to 1
his 1
mother 1
and 1
also 1
for 1
other 1
reasons 1
he 1
had 1
always 1
hated 1
and 1
desired 1
to 1
keep 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
It 1
appeared 1
to 1
Dorian 1
to 1
have 1
but 1
little 1
changed 1
There 1
was 1
the 1
huge 1
Italian 1
cassone 1
with 1
its 1
fantastically 1
painted 1
panels 1
and 1
its 1
tarnished 1
gilt 1
mouldings 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
so 1
often 1
hidden 1
himself 1
as 1
a 1
boy 1
There 1
the 1
satinwood 1
book 1
case 1
filled 1
with 1
his 1
dog 1
eared 1
schoolbooks 1
On 1
the 1
wall 1
behind 1
it 1
was 1
hanging 1
the 1
same 1
ragged 1
Flemish 1
tapestry 1
where 1
a 1
faded 1
king 1
and 1
queen 1
were 1
playing 1
chess 1
in 1
a 1
garden 1
while 1
a 1
company 1
of 1
hawkers 1
rode 1
by 1
carrying 1
hooded 1
birds 1
on 1
their 1
gauntleted 1
wrists 1
How 1
well 1
he 1
remembered 1
it 1
all 1
Every 1
moment 1
of 1
his 1
lonely 1
childhood 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
round 1
He 1
recalled 1
the 1
stainless 1
purity 1
of 1
his 1
boyish 1
life 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
horrible 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
here 1
the 1
fatal 1
portrait 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
hidden 1
away 1
How 1
little 1
he 1
had 1
thought 1
in 1
those 1
dead 1
days 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
him 1
But 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
other 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
so 1
secure 1
from 1
prying 1
eyes 1
as 1
this 1
He 1
had 1
the 1
key 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
could 1
enter 1
it 1
Beneath 1
its 1
purple 1
pall 1
the 1
face 1
painted 1
on 1
the 1
canvas 1
could 1
grow 1
bestial 1
sodden 1
and 1
unclean 1
What 1
did 1
it 1
matter 1
No 1
one 1
could 1
see 1
it 1
He 1
himself 1
would 1
not 1
see 1
it 1
Why 1
should 1
he 1
watch 1
the 1
hideous 1
corruption 1
of 1
his 1
soul 1
He 1
kept 1
his 1
youth 1
that 1
was 1
enough 1
And 1
besides 1
might 1
not 1
his 1
nature 1
grow 1
finer 1
after 1
all 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
reason 1
that 1
the 1
future 1
should 1
be 1
so 1
full 1
of 1
shame 1
Some 1
love 1
might 1
come 1
across 1
his 1
life 1
and 1
purify 1
him 1
and 1
shield 1
him 1
from 1
those 1
sins 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
already 1
stirring 1
in 1
spirit 1
and 1
in 1
flesh 1
those 1
curious 1
unpictured 1
sins 1
whose 1
very 1
mystery 1
lent 1
them 1
their 1
subtlety 1
and 1
their 1
charm 1
Perhaps 1
some 1
day 1
the 1
cruel 1
look 1
would 1
have 1
passed 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
scarlet 1
sensitive 1
mouth 1
and 1
he 1
might 1
show 1
to 1
the 1
world 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
s 1
masterpiece 1
No 1
that 1
was 1
impossible 1
Hour 1
by 1
hour 1
and 1
week 1
by 1
week 1
the 1
thing 1
upon 1
the 1
canvas 1
was 1
growing 1
old 1
It 1
might 1
escape 1
the 1
hideousness 1
of 1
sin 1
but 1
the 1
hideousness 1
of 1
age 1
was 1
in 1
store 1
for 1
it 1
The 1
cheeks 1
would 1
become 1
hollow 1
or 1
flaccid 1
Yellow 1
crow 1
s 1
feet 1
would 1
creep 1
round 1
the 1
fading 1
eyes 1
and 1
make 1
them 1
horrible 1
The 1
hair 1
would 1
lose 1
its 1
brightness 1
the 1
mouth 1
would 1
gape 1
or 1
droop 1
would 1
be 1
foolish 1
or 1
gross 1
as 1
the 1
mouths 1
of 1
old 1
men 1
are 1
There 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
wrinkled 1
throat 1
the 1
cold 1
blue 1
veined 1
hands 1
the 1
twisted 1
body 1
that 1
he 1
remembered 1
in 1
the 1
grandfather 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
so 1
stern 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
boyhood 1
The 1
picture 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
concealed 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
help 1
for 1
it 1
Bring 1
it 1
in 1
Mr 1
Hubbard 1
please 1
he 1
said 1
wearily 1
turning 1
round 1
I 1
am 1
sorry 1
I 1
kept 1
you 1
so 1
long 1
I 1
was 1
thinking 1
of 1
something 1
else 1
Always 1
glad 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
rest 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
answered 1
the 1
frame 1
maker 1
who 1
was 1
still 1
gasping 1
for 1
breath 1
Where 1
shall 1
we 1
put 1
it 1
sir 1
Oh 1
anywhere 1
Here 1
this 1
will 1
do 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
have 1
it 1
hung 1
up 1
Just 1
lean 1
it 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
Thanks 1
Might 1
one 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
art 1
sir 1
Dorian 1
started 1
It 1
would 1
not 1
interest 1
you 1
Mr 1
Hubbard 1
he 1
said 1
keeping 1
his 1
eye 1
on 1
the 1
man 1
He 1
felt 1
ready 1
to 1
leap 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
fling 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
if 1
he 1
dared 1
to 1
lift 1
the 1
gorgeous 1
hanging 1
that 1
concealed 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
I 1
shan 1
t 1
trouble 1
you 1
any 1
more 1
now 1
I 1
am 1
much 1
obliged 1
for 1
your 1
kindness 1
in 1
coming 1
round 1
Not 1
at 1
all 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
Ever 1
ready 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
for 1
you 1
sir 1
And 1
Mr 1
Hubbard 1
tramped 1
downstairs 1
followed 1
by 1
the 1
assistant 1
who 1
glanced 1
back 1
at 1
Dorian 1
with 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
shy 1
wonder 1
in 1
his 1
rough 1
uncomely 1
face 1
He 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
any 1
one 1
so 1
marvellous 1
When 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
their 1
footsteps 1
had 1
died 1
away 1
Dorian 1
locked 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
put 1
the 1
key 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
He 1
felt 1
safe 1
now 1
No 1
one 1
would 1
ever 1
look 1
upon 1
the 1
horrible 1
thing 1
No 1
eye 1
but 1
his 1
would 1
ever 1
see 1
his 1
shame 1
On 1
reaching 1
the 1
library 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
after 1
five 1
o 1
clock 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
tea 1
had 1
been 1
already 1
brought 1
up 1
On 1
a 1
little 1
table 1
of 1
dark 1
perfumed 1
wood 1
thickly 1
incrusted 1
with 1
nacre 1
a 1
present 1
from 1
Lady 1
Radley 1
his 1
guardian 1
s 1
wife 1
a 1
pretty 1
professional 1
invalid 1
who 1
had 1
spent 1
the 1
preceding 1
winter 1
in 1
Cairo 1
was 1
lying 1
a 1
note 1
from 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
and 1
beside 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
book 1
bound 1
in 1
yellow 1
paper 1
the 1
cover 1
slightly 1
torn 1
and 1
the 1
edges 1
soiled 1
A 1
copy 1
of 1
the 1
third 1
edition 1
of 1
The 1
St 1
James 1
s 1
Gazette 1
had 1
been 1
placed 1
on 1
the 1
tea 1
tray 1
It 1
was 1
evident 1
that 1
Victor 1
had 1
returned 1
He 1
wondered 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
met 1
the 1
men 1
in 1
the 1
hall 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
leaving 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
had 1
wormed 1
out 1
of 1
them 1
what 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
doing 1
He 1
would 1
be 1
sure 1
to 1
miss 1
the 1
picture 1
had 1
no 1
doubt 1
missed 1
it 1
already 1
while 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
laying 1
the 1
tea 1
things 1
The 1
screen 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
set 1
back 1
and 1
a 1
blank 1
space 1
was 1
visible 1
on 1
the 1
wall 1
Perhaps 1
some 1
night 1
he 1
might 1
find 1
him 1
creeping 1
upstairs 1
and 1
trying 1
to 1
force 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
horrible 1
thing 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
spy 1
in 1
one 1
s 1
house 1
He 1
had 1
heard 1
of 1
rich 1
men 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
blackmailed 1
all 1
their 1
lives 1
by 1
some 1
servant 1
who 1
had 1
read 1
a 1
letter 1
or 1
overheard 1
a 1
conversation 1
or 1
picked 1
up 1
a 1
card 1
with 1
an 1
address 1
or 1
found 1
beneath 1
a 1
pillow 1
a 1
withered 1
flower 1
or 1
a 1
shred 1
of 1
crumpled 1
lace 1
He 1
sighed 1
and 1
having 1
poured 1
himself 1
out 1
some 1
tea 1
opened 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
s 1
note 1
It 1
was 1
simply 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
he 1
sent 1
him 1
round 1
the 1
evening 1
paper 1
and 1
a 1
book 1
that 1
might 1
interest 1
him 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
at 1
the 1
club 1
at 1
eight 1
fifteen 1
He 1
opened 1
The 1
St 1
James 1
s 1
languidly 1
and 1
looked 1
through 1
it 1
A 1
red 1
pencil 1
mark 1
on 1
the 1
fifth 1
page 1
caught 1
his 1
eye 1
It 1
drew 1
attention 1
to 1
the 1
following 1
paragraph 1
INQUEST 1
ON 1
AN 1
ACTRESS 1
An 1
inquest 1
was 1
held 1
this 1
morning 1
at 1
the 1
Bell 1
Tavern 1
Hoxton 1
Road 1
by 1
Mr 1
Danby 1
the 1
District 1
Coroner 1
on 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
a 1
young 1
actress 1
recently 1
engaged 1
at 1
the 1
Royal 1
Theatre 1
Holborn 1
A 1
verdict 1
of 1
death 1
by 1
misadventure 1
was 1
returned 1
Considerable 1
sympathy 1
was 1
expressed 1
for 1
the 1
mother 1
of 1
the 1
deceased 1
who 1
was 1
greatly 1
affected 1
during 1
the 1
giving 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
evidence 1
and 1
that 1
of 1
Dr 1
Birrell 1
who 1
had 1
made 1
the 1
post 1
mortem 1
examination 1
of 1
the 1
deceased 1
He 1
frowned 1
and 1
tearing 1
the 1
paper 1
in 1
two 1
went 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
flung 1
the 1
pieces 1
away 1
How 1
ugly 1
it 1
all 1
was 1
And 1
how 1
horribly 1
real 1
ugliness 1
made 1
things 1
He 1
felt 1
a 1
little 1
annoyed 1
with 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
for 1
having 1
sent 1
him 1
the 1
report 1
And 1
it 1
was 1
certainly 1
stupid 1
of 1
him 1
to 1
have 1
marked 1
it 1
with 1
red 1
pencil 1
Victor 1
might 1
have 1
read 1
it 1
The 1
man 1
knew 1
more 1
than 1
enough 1
English 1
for 1
that 1
Perhaps 1
he 1
had 1
read 1
it 1
and 1
had 1
begun 1
to 1
suspect 1
something 1
And 1
yet 1
what 1
did 1
it 1
matter 1
What 1
had 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
s 1
death 1
There 1
was 1
nothing 1
to 1
fear 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
had 1
not 1
killed 1
her 1
His 1
eye 1
fell 1
on 1
the 1
yellow 1
book 1
that 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
had 1
sent 1
him 1
What 1
was 1
it 1
he 1
wondered 1
He 1
went 1
towards 1
the 1
little 1
pearl 1
coloured 1
octagonal 1
stand 1
that 1
had 1
always 1
looked 1
to 1
him 1
like 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
some 1
strange 1
Egyptian 1
bees 1
that 1
wrought 1
in 1
silver 1
and 1
taking 1
up 1
the 1
volume 1
flung 1
himself 1
into 1
an 1
arm 1
chair 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
turn 1
over 1
the 1
leaves 1
After 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
he 1
became 1
absorbed 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
strangest 1
book 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
ever 1
read 1
It 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
in 1
exquisite 1
raiment 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
delicate 1
sound 1
of 1
flutes 1
the 1
sins 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
were 1
passing 1
in 1
dumb 1
show 1
before 1
him 1
Things 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
dimly 1
dreamed 1
of 1
were 1
suddenly 1
made 1
real 1
to 1
him 1
Things 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
dreamed 1
were 1
gradually 1
revealed 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
novel 1
without 1
a 1
plot 1
and 1
with 1
only 1
one 1
character 1
being 1
indeed 1
simply 1
a 1
psychological 1
study 1
of 1
a 1
certain 1
young 1
Parisian 1
who 1
spent 1
his 1
life 1
trying 1
to 1
realize 1
in 1
the 1
nineteenth 1
century 1
all 1
the 1
passions 1
and 1
modes 1
of 1
thought 1
that 1
belonged 1
to 1
every 1
century 1
except 1
his 1
own 1
and 1
to 1
sum 1
up 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
in 1
himself 1
the 1
various 1
moods 1
through 1
which 1
the 1
world 1
spirit 1
had 1
ever 1
passed 1
loving 1
for 1
their 1
mere 1
artificiality 1
those 1
renunciations 1
that 1
men 1
have 1
unwisely 1
called 1
virtue 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
those 1
natural 1
rebellions 1
that 1
wise 1
men 1
still 1
call 1
sin 1
The 1
style 1
in 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
written 1
was 1
that 1
curious 1
jewelled 1
style 1
vivid 1
and 1
obscure 1
at 1
once 1
full 1
of 1
argot 1
and 1
of 1
archaisms 1
of 1
technical 1
expressions 1
and 1
of 1
elaborate 1
paraphrases 1
that 1
characterizes 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
finest 1
artists 1
of 1
the 1
French 1
school 1
of 1
Symbolistes 1
There 1
were 1
in 1
it 1
metaphors 1
as 1
monstrous 1
as 1
orchids 1
and 1
as 1
subtle 1
in 1
colour 1
The 1
life 1
of 1
the 1
senses 1
was 1
described 1
in 1
the 1
terms 1
of 1
mystical 1
philosophy 1
One 1
hardly 1
knew 1
at 1
times 1
whether 1
one 1
was 1
reading 1
the 1
spiritual 1
ecstasies 1
of 1
some 1
mediaeval 1
saint 1
or 1
the 1
morbid 1
confessions 1
of 1
a 1
modern 1
sinner 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
poisonous 1
book 1
The 1
heavy 1
odour 1
of 1
incense 1
seemed 1
to 1
cling 1
about 1
its 1
pages 1
and 1
to 1
trouble 1
the 1
brain 1
The 1
mere 1
cadence 1
of 1
the 1
sentences 1
the 1
subtle 1
monotony 1
of 1
their 1
music 1
so 1
full 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
of 1
complex 1
refrains 1
and 1
movements 1
elaborately 1
repeated 1
produced 1
in 1
the 1
mind 1
of 1
the 1
lad 1
as 1
he 1
passed 1
from 1
chapter 1
to 1
chapter 1
a 1
form 1
of 1
reverie 1
a 1
malady 1
of 1
dreaming 1
that 1
made 1
him 1
unconscious 1
of 1
the 1
falling 1
day 1
and 1
creeping 1
shadows 1
Cloudless 1
and 1
pierced 1
by 1
one 1
solitary 1
star 1
a 1
copper 1
green 1
sky 1
gleamed 1
through 1
the 1
windows 1
He 1
read 1
on 1
by 1
its 1
wan 1
light 1
till 1
he 1
could 1
read 1
no 1
more 1
Then 1
after 1
his 1
valet 1
had 1
reminded 1
him 1
several 1
times 1
of 1
the 1
lateness 1
of 1
the 1
hour 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
going 1
into 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
placed 1
the 1
book 1
on 1
the 1
little 1
Florentine 1
table 1
that 1
always 1
stood 1
at 1
his 1
bedside 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
dress 1
for 1
dinner 1
It 1
was 1
almost 1
nine 1
o 1
clock 1
before 1
he 1
reached 1
the 1
club 1
where 1
he 1
found 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
sitting 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
room 1
looking 1
very 1
much 1
bored 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
sorry 1
Harry 1
he 1
cried 1
but 1
really 1
it 1
is 1
entirely 1
your 1
fault 1
That 1
book 1
you 1
sent 1
me 1
so 1
fascinated 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
forgot 1
how 1
the 1
time 1
was 1
going 1
Yes 1
I 1
thought 1
you 1
would 1
like 1
it 1
replied 1
his 1
host 1
rising 1
from 1
his 1
chair 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
say 1
I 1
liked 1
it 1
Harry 1
I 1
said 1
it 1
fascinated 1
me 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
difference 1
Ah 1
you 1
have 1
discovered 1
that 1
murmured 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
And 1
they 1
passed 1
into 1
the 1
dining 1
room 1
CHAPTER 1
For 1
years 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
could 1
not 1
free 1
himself 1
from 1
the 1
influence 1
of 1
this 1
book 1
Or 1
perhaps 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
more 1
accurate 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
he 1
never 1
sought 1
to 1
free 1
himself 1
from 1
it 1
He 1
procured 1
from 1
Paris 1
no 1
less 1
than 1
nine 1
large 1
paper 1
copies 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
edition 1
and 1
had 1
them 1
bound 1
in 1
different 1
colours 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
suit 1
his 1
various 1
moods 1
and 1
the 1
changing 1
fancies 1
of 1
a 1
nature 1
over 1
which 1
he 1
seemed 1
at 1
times 1
to 1
have 1
almost 1
entirely 1
lost 1
control 1
The 1
hero 1
the 1
wonderful 1
young 1
Parisian 1
in 1
whom 1
the 1
romantic 1
and 1
the 1
scientific 1
temperaments 1
were 1
so 1
strangely 1
blended 1
became 1
to 1
him 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
prefiguring 1
type 1
of 1
himself 1
And 1
indeed 1
the 1
whole 1
book 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
contain 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
life 1
written 1
before 1
he 1
had 1
lived 1
it 1
In 1
one 1
point 1
he 1
was 1
more 1
fortunate 1
than 1
the 1
novel 1
s 1
fantastic 1
hero 1
He 1
never 1
knew 1
never 1
indeed 1
had 1
any 1
cause 1
to 1
know 1
that 1
somewhat 1
grotesque 1
dread 1
of 1
mirrors 1
and 1
polished 1
metal 1
surfaces 1
and 1
still 1
water 1
which 1
came 1
upon 1
the 1
young 1
Parisian 1
so 1
early 1
in 1
his 1
life 1
and 1
was 1
occasioned 1
by 1
the 1
sudden 1
decay 1
of 1
a 1
beau 1
that 1
had 1
once 1
apparently 1
been 1
so 1
remarkable 1
It 1
was 1
with 1
an 1
almost 1
cruel 1
joy 1
and 1
perhaps 1
in 1
nearly 1
every 1
joy 1
as 1
certainly 1
in 1
every 1
pleasure 1
cruelty 1
has 1
its 1
place 1
that 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
read 1
the 1
latter 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
book 1
with 1
its 1
really 1
tragic 1
if 1
somewhat 1
overemphasized 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
sorrow 1
and 1
despair 1
of 1
one 1
who 1
had 1
himself 1
lost 1
what 1
in 1
others 1
and 1
the 1
world 1
he 1
had 1
most 1
dearly 1
valued 1
For 1
the 1
wonderful 1
beauty 1
that 1
had 1
so 1
fascinated 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
and 1
many 1
others 1
besides 1
him 1
seemed 1
never 1
to 1
leave 1
him 1
Even 1
those 1
who 1
had 1
heard 1
the 1
most 1
evil 1
things 1
against 1
him 1
and 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
strange 1
rumours 1
about 1
his 1
mode 1
of 1
life 1
crept 1
through 1
London 1
and 1
became 1
the 1
chatter 1
of 1
the 1
clubs 1
could 1
not 1
believe 1
anything 1
to 1
his 1
dishonour 1
when 1
they 1
saw 1
him 1
He 1
had 1
always 1
the 1
look 1
of 1
one 1
who 1
had 1
kept 1
himself 1
unspotted 1
from 1
the 1
world 1
Men 1
who 1
talked 1
grossly 1
became 1
silent 1
when 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
There 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
the 1
purity 1
of 1
his 1
face 1
that 1
rebuked 1
them 1
His 1
mere 1
presence 1
seemed 1
to 1
recall 1
to 1
them 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
innocence 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
tarnished 1
They 1
wondered 1
how 1
one 1
so 1
charming 1
and 1
graceful 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
could 1
have 1
escaped 1
the 1
stain 1
of 1
an 1
age 1
that 1
was 1
at 1
once 1
sordid 1
and 1
sensual 1
Often 1
on 1
returning 1
home 1
from 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
mysterious 1
and 1
prolonged 1
absences 1
that 1
gave 1
rise 1
to 1
such 1
strange 1
conjecture 1
among 1
those 1
who 1
were 1
his 1
friends 1
or 1
thought 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
so 1
he 1
himself 1
would 1
creep 1
upstairs 1
to 1
the 1
locked 1
room 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
the 1
key 1
that 1
never 1
left 1
him 1
now 1
and 1
stand 1
with 1
a 1
mirror 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
portrait 1
that 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
had 1
painted 1
of 1
him 1
looking 1
now 1
at 1
the 1
evil 1
and 1
aging 1
face 1
on 1
the 1
canvas 1
and 1
now 1
at 1
the 1
fair 1
young 1
face 1
that 1
laughed 1
back 1
at 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
polished 1
glass 1
The 1
very 1
sharpness 1
of 1
the 1
contrast 1
used 1
to 1
quicken 1
his 1
sense 1
of 1
pleasure 1
He 1
grew 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
enamoured 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
beauty 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
interested 1
in 1
the 1
corruption 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
soul 1
He 1
would 1
examine 1
with 1
minute 1
care 1
and 1
sometimes 1
with 1
a 1
monstrous 1
and 1
terrible 1
delight 1
the 1
hideous 1
lines 1
that 1
seared 1
the 1
wrinkling 1
forehead 1
or 1
crawled 1
around 1
the 1
heavy 1
sensual 1
mouth 1
wondering 1
sometimes 1
which 1
were 1
the 1
more 1
horrible 1
the 1
signs 1
of 1
sin 1
or 1
the 1
signs 1
of 1
age 1
He 1
would 1
place 1
his 1
white 1
hands 1
beside 1
the 1
coarse 1
bloated 1
hands 1
of 1
the 1
picture 1
and 1
smile 1
He 1
mocked 1
the 1
misshapen 1
body 1
and 1
the 1
failing 1
limbs 1
There 1
were 1
moments 1
indeed 1
at 1
night 1
when 1
lying 1
sleepless 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
delicately 1
scented 1
chamber 1
or 1
in 1
the 1
sordid 1
room 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
ill 1
famed 1
tavern 1
near 1
the 1
docks 1
which 1
under 1
an 1
assumed 1
name 1
and 1
in 1
disguise 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
habit 1
to 1
frequent 1
he 1
would 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
ruin 1
he 1
had 1
brought 1
upon 1
his 1
soul 1
with 1
a 1
pity 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
the 1
more 1
poignant 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
purely 1
selfish 1
But 1
moments 1
such 1
as 1
these 1
were 1
rare 1
That 1
curiosity 1
about 1
life 1
which 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
had 1
first 1
stirred 1
in 1
him 1
as 1
they 1
sat 1
together 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
of 1
their 1
friend 1
seemed 1
to 1
increase 1
with 1
gratification 1
The 1
more 1
he 1
knew 1
the 1
more 1
he 1
desired 1
to 1
know 1
He 1
had 1
mad 1
hungers 1
that 1
grew 1
more 1
ravenous 1
as 1
he 1
fed 1
them 1
Yet 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
really 1
reckless 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
in 1
his 1
relations 1
to 1
society 1
Once 1
or 1
twice 1
every 1
month 1
during 1
the 1
winter 1
and 1
on 1
each 1
Wednesday 1
evening 1
while 1
the 1
season 1
lasted 1
he 1
would 1
throw 1
open 1
to 1
the 1
world 1
his 1
beautiful 1
house 1
and 1
have 1
the 1
most 1
celebrated 1
musicians 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
to 1
charm 1
his 1
guests 1
with 1
the 1
wonders 1
of 1
their 1
art 1
His 1
little 1
dinners 1
in 1
the 1
settling 1
of 1
which 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
always 1
assisted 1
him 1
were 1
noted 1
as 1
much 1
for 1
the 1
careful 1
selection 1
and 1
placing 1
of 1
those 1
invited 1
as 1
for 1
the 1
exquisite 1
taste 1
shown 1
in 1
the 1
decoration 1
of 1
the 1
table 1
with 1
its 1
subtle 1
symphonic 1
arrangements 1
of 1
exotic 1
flowers 1
and 1
embroidered 1
cloths 1
and 1
antique 1
plate 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
silver 1
Indeed 1
there 1
were 1
many 1
especially 1
among 1
the 1
very 1
young 1
men 1
who 1
saw 1
or 1
fancied 1
that 1
they 1
saw 1
in 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
the 1
true 1
realization 1
of 1
a 1
type 1
of 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
often 1
dreamed 1
in 1
Eton 1
or 1
Oxford 1
days 1
a 1
type 1
that 1
was 1
to 1
combine 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
real 1
culture 1
of 1
the 1
scholar 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
grace 1
and 1
distinction 1
and 1
perfect 1
manner 1
of 1
a 1
citizen 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
To 1
them 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
of 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
those 1
whom 1
Dante 1
describes 1
as 1
having 1
sought 1
to 1
make 1
themselves 1
perfect 1
by 1
the 1
worship 1
of 1
beauty 1
Like 1
Gautier 1
he 1
was 1
one 1
for 1
whom 1
the 1
visible 1
world 1
existed 1
And 1
certainly 1
to 1
him 1
life 1
itself 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
the 1
greatest 1
of 1
the 1
arts 1
and 1
for 1
it 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
arts 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
but 1
a 1
preparation 1
Fashion 1
by 1
which 1
what 1
is 1
really 1
fantastic 1
becomes 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
universal 1
and 1
dandyism 1
which 1
in 1
its 1
own 1
way 1
is 1
an 1
attempt 1
to 1
assert 1
the 1
absolute 1
modernity 1
of 1
beauty 1
had 1
of 1
course 1
their 1
fascination 1
for 1
him 1
His 1
mode 1
of 1
dressing 1
and 1
the 1
particular 1
styles 1
that 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
he 1
affected 1
had 1
their 1
marked 1
influence 1
on 1
the 1
young 1
exquisites 1
of 1
the 1
Mayfair 1
balls 1
and 1
Pall 1
Mall 1
club 1
windows 1
who 1
copied 1
him 1
in 1
everything 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
reproduce 1
the 1
accidental 1
charm 1
of 1
his 1
graceful 1
though 1
to 1
him 1
only 1
half 1
serious 1
fopperies 1
For 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
but 1
too 1
ready 1
to 1
accept 1
the 1
position 1
that 1
was 1
almost 1
immediately 1
offered 1
to 1
him 1
on 1
his 1
coming 1
of 1
age 1
and 1
found 1
indeed 1
a 1
subtle 1
pleasure 1
in 1
the 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
really 1
become 1
to 1
the 1
London 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
day 1
what 1
to 1
imperial 1
Neronian 1
Rome 1
the 1
author 1
of 1
the 1
Satyricon 1
once 1
had 1
been 1
yet 1
in 1
his 1
inmost 1
heart 1
he 1
desired 1
to 1
be 1
something 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
mere 1
arbiter 1
elegantiarum 1
to 1
be 1
consulted 1
on 1
the 1
wearing 1
of 1
a 1
jewel 1
or 1
the 1
knotting 1
of 1
a 1
necktie 1
or 1
the 1
conduct 1
of 1
a 1
cane 1
He 1
sought 1
to 1
elaborate 1
some 1
new 1
scheme 1
of 1
life 1
that 1
would 1
have 1
its 1
reasoned 1
philosophy 1
and 1
its 1
ordered 1
principles 1
and 1
find 1
in 1
the 1
spiritualizing 1
of 1
the 1
senses 1
its 1
highest 1
realization 1
The 1
worship 1
of 1
the 1
senses 1
has 1
often 1
and 1
with 1
much 1
justice 1
been 1
decried 1
men 1
feeling 1
a 1
natural 1
instinct 1
of 1
terror 1
about 1
passions 1
and 1
sensations 1
that 1
seem 1
stronger 1
than 1
themselves 1
and 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
conscious 1
of 1
sharing 1
with 1
the 1
less 1
highly 1
organized 1
forms 1
of 1
existence 1
But 1
it 1
appeared 1
to 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
that 1
the 1
true 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
senses 1
had 1
never 1
been 1
understood 1
and 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
remained 1
savage 1
and 1
animal 1
merely 1
because 1
the 1
world 1
had 1
sought 1
to 1
starve 1
them 1
into 1
submission 1
or 1
to 1
kill 1
them 1
by 1
pain 1
instead 1
of 1
aiming 1
at 1
making 1
them 1
elements 1
of 1
a 1
new 1
spirituality 1
of 1
which 1
a 1
fine 1
instinct 1
for 1
beauty 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
dominant 1
characteristic 1
As 1
he 1
looked 1
back 1
upon 1
man 1
moving 1
through 1
history 1
he 1
was 1
haunted 1
by 1
a 1
feeling 1
of 1
loss 1
So 1
much 1
had 1
been 1
surrendered 1
and 1
to 1
such 1
little 1
purpose 1
There 1
had 1
been 1
mad 1
wilful 1
rejections 1
monstrous 1
forms 1
of 1
self 1
torture 1
and 1
self 1
denial 1
whose 1
origin 1
was 1
fear 1
and 1
whose 1
result 1
was 1
a 1
degradation 1
infinitely 1
more 1
terrible 1
than 1
that 1
fancied 1
degradation 1
from 1
which 1
in 1
their 1
ignorance 1
they 1
had 1
sought 1
to 1
escape 1
Nature 1
in 1
her 1
wonderful 1
irony 1
driving 1
out 1
the 1
anchorite 1
to 1
feed 1
with 1
the 1
wild 1
animals 1
of 1
the 1
desert 1
and 1
giving 1
to 1
the 1
hermit 1
the 1
beasts 1
of 1
the 1
field 1
as 1
his 1
companions 1
Yes 1
there 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
as 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
had 1
prophesied 1
a 1
new 1
Hedonism 1
that 1
was 1
to 1
recreate 1
life 1
and 1
to 1
save 1
it 1
from 1
that 1
harsh 1
uncomely 1
puritanism 1
that 1
is 1
having 1
in 1
our 1
own 1
day 1
its 1
curious 1
revival 1
It 1
was 1
to 1
have 1
its 1
service 1
of 1
the 1
intellect 1
certainly 1
yet 1
it 1
was 1
never 1
to 1
accept 1
any 1
theory 1
or 1
system 1
that 1
would 1
involve 1
the 1
sacrifice 1
of 1
any 1
mode 1
of 1
passionate 1
experience 1
Its 1
aim 1
indeed 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
experience 1
itself 1
and 1
not 1
the 1
fruits 1
of 1
experience 1
sweet 1
or 1
bitter 1
as 1
they 1
might 1
be 1
Of 1
the 1
asceticism 1
that 1
deadens 1
the 1
senses 1
as 1
of 1
the 1
vulgar 1
profligacy 1
that 1
dulls 1
them 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
know 1
nothing 1
But 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
teach 1
man 1
to 1
concentrate 1
himself 1
upon 1
the 1
moments 1
of 1
a 1
life 1
that 1
is 1
itself 1
but 1
a 1
moment 1
There 1
are 1
few 1
of 1
us 1
who 1
have 1
not 1
sometimes 1
wakened 1
before 1
dawn 1
either 1
after 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
dreamless 1
nights 1
that 1
make 1
us 1
almost 1
enamoured 1
of 1
death 1
or 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
nights 1
of 1
horror 1
and 1
misshapen 1
joy 1
when 1
through 1
the 1
chambers 1
of 1
the 1
brain 1
sweep 1
phantoms 1
more 1
terrible 1
than 1
reality 1
itself 1
and 1
instinct 1
with 1
that 1
vivid 1
life 1
that 1
lurks 1
in 1
all 1
grotesques 1
and 1
that 1
lends 1
to 1
Gothic 1
art 1
its 1
enduring 1
vitality 1
this 1
art 1
being 1
one 1
might 1
fancy 1
especially 1
the 1
art 1
of 1
those 1
whose 1
minds 1
have 1
been 1
troubled 1
with 1
the 1
malady 1
of 1
reverie 1
Gradually 1
white 1
fingers 1
creep 1
through 1
the 1
curtains 1
and 1
they 1
appear 1
to 1
tremble 1
In 1
black 1
fantastic 1
shapes 1
dumb 1
shadows 1
crawl 1
into 1
the 1
corners 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
crouch 1
there 1
Outside 1
there 1
is 1
the 1
stirring 1
of 1
birds 1
among 1
the 1
leaves 1
or 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
men 1
going 1
forth 1
to 1
their 1
work 1
or 1
the 1
sigh 1
and 1
sob 1
of 1
the 1
wind 1
coming 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
hills 1
and 1
wandering 1
round 1
the 1
silent 1
house 1
as 1
though 1
it 1
feared 1
to 1
wake 1
the 1
sleepers 1
and 1
yet 1
must 1
needs 1
call 1
forth 1
sleep 1
from 1
her 1
purple 1
cave 1
Veil 1
after 1
veil 1
of 1
thin 1
dusky 1
gauze 1
is 1
lifted 1
and 1
by 1
degrees 1
the 1
forms 1
and 1
colours 1
of 1
things 1
are 1
restored 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
we 1
watch 1
the 1
dawn 1
remaking 1
the 1
world 1
in 1
its 1
antique 1
pattern 1
The 1
wan 1
mirrors 1
get 1
back 1
their 1
mimic 1
life 1
The 1
flameless 1
tapers 1
stand 1
where 1
we 1
had 1
left 1
them 1
and 1
beside 1
them 1
lies 1
the 1
half 1
cut 1
book 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
studying 1
or 1
the 1
wired 1
flower 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
worn 1
at 1
the 1
ball 1
or 1
the 1
letter 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
afraid 1
to 1
read 1
or 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
read 1
too 1
often 1
Nothing 1
seems 1
to 1
us 1
changed 1
Out 1
of 1
the 1
unreal 1
shadows 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
comes 1
back 1
the 1
real 1
life 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
known 1
We 1
have 1
to 1
resume 1
it 1
where 1
we 1
had 1
left 1
off 1
and 1
there 1
steals 1
over 1
us 1
a 1
terrible 1
sense 1
of 1
the 1
necessity 1
for 1
the 1
continuance 1
of 1
energy 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
wearisome 1
round 1
of 1
stereotyped 1
habits 1
or 1
a 1
wild 1
longing 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
that 1
our 1
eyelids 1
might 1
open 1
some 1
morning 1
upon 1
a 1
world 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
refashioned 1
anew 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
for 1
our 1
pleasure 1
a 1
world 1
in 1
which 1
things 1
would 1
have 1
fresh 1
shapes 1
and 1
colours 1
and 1
be 1
changed 1
or 1
have 1
other 1
secrets 1
a 1
world 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
past 1
would 1
have 1
little 1
or 1
no 1
place 1
or 1
survive 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
in 1
no 1
conscious 1
form 1
of 1
obligation 1
or 1
regret 1
the 1
remembrance 1
even 1
of 1
joy 1
having 1
its 1
bitterness 1
and 1
the 1
memories 1
of 1
pleasure 1
their 1
pain 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
creation 1
of 1
such 1
worlds 1
as 1
these 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
true 1
object 1
or 1
amongst 1
the 1
true 1
objects 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
in 1
his 1
search 1
for 1
sensations 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
at 1
once 1
new 1
and 1
delightful 1
and 1
possess 1
that 1
element 1
of 1
strangeness 1
that 1
is 1
so 1
essential 1
to 1
romance 1
he 1
would 1
often 1
adopt 1
certain 1
modes 1
of 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
knew 1
to 1
be 1
really 1
alien 1
to 1
his 1
nature 1
abandon 1
himself 1
to 1
their 1
subtle 1
influences 1
and 1
then 1
having 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
caught 1
their 1
colour 1
and 1
satisfied 1
his 1
intellectual 1
curiosity 1
leave 1
them 1
with 1
that 1
curious 1
indifference 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
incompatible 1
with 1
a 1
real 1
ardour 1
of 1
temperament 1
and 1
that 1
indeed 1
according 1
to 1
certain 1
modern 1
psychologists 1
is 1
often 1
a 1
condition 1
of 1
it 1
It 1
was 1
rumoured 1
of 1
him 1
once 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
join 1
the 1
Roman 1
Catholic 1
communion 1
and 1
certainly 1
the 1
Roman 1
ritual 1
had 1
always 1
a 1
great 1
attraction 1
for 1
him 1
The 1
daily 1
sacrifice 1
more 1
awful 1
really 1
than 1
all 1
the 1
sacrifices 1
of 1
the 1
antique 1
world 1
stirred 1
him 1
as 1
much 1
by 1
its 1
superb 1
rejection 1
of 1
the 1
evidence 1
of 1
the 1
senses 1
as 1
by 1
the 1
primitive 1
simplicity 1
of 1
its 1
elements 1
and 1
the 1
eternal 1
pathos 1
of 1
the 1
human 1
tragedy 1
that 1
it 1
sought 1
to 1
symbolize 1
He 1
loved 1
to 1
kneel 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
cold 1
marble 1
pavement 1
and 1
watch 1
the 1
priest 1
in 1
his 1
stiff 1
flowered 1
dalmatic 1
slowly 1
and 1
with 1
white 1
hands 1
moving 1
aside 1
the 1
veil 1
of 1
the 1
tabernacle 1
or 1
raising 1
aloft 1
the 1
jewelled 1
lantern 1
shaped 1
monstrance 1
with 1
that 1
pallid 1
wafer 1
that 1
at 1
times 1
one 1
would 1
fain 1
think 1
is 1
indeed 1
the 1
panis 1
caelestis 1
the 1
bread 1
of 1
angels 1
or 1
robed 1
in 1
the 1
garments 1
of 1
the 1
Passion 1
of 1
Christ 1
breaking 1
the 1
Host 1
into 1
the 1
chalice 1
and 1
smiting 1
his 1
breast 1
for 1
his 1
sins 1
The 1
fuming 1
censers 1
that 1
the 1
grave 1
boys 1
in 1
their 1
lace 1
and 1
scarlet 1
tossed 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
like 1
great 1
gilt 1
flowers 1
had 1
their 1
subtle 1
fascination 1
for 1
him 1
As 1
he 1
passed 1
out 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
look 1
with 1
wonder 1
at 1
the 1
black 1
confessionals 1
and 1
long 1
to 1
sit 1
in 1
the 1
dim 1
shadow 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
listen 1
to 1
men 1
and 1
women 1
whispering 1
through 1
the 1
worn 1
grating 1
the 1
true 1
story 1
of 1
their 1
lives 1
But 1
he 1
never 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
error 1
of 1
arresting 1
his 1
intellectual 1
development 1
by 1
any 1
formal 1
acceptance 1
of 1
creed 1
or 1
system 1
or 1
of 1
mistaking 1
for 1
a 1
house 1
in 1
which 1
to 1
live 1
an 1
inn 1
that 1
is 1
but 1
suitable 1
for 1
the 1
sojourn 1
of 1
a 1
night 1
or 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
of 1
a 1
night 1
in 1
which 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
stars 1
and 1
the 1
moon 1
is 1
in 1
travail 1
Mysticism 1
with 1
its 1
marvellous 1
power 1
of 1
making 1
common 1
things 1
strange 1
to 1
us 1
and 1
the 1
subtle 1
antinomianism 1
that 1
always 1
seems 1
to 1
accompany 1
it 1
moved 1
him 1
for 1
a 1
season 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
season 1
he 1
inclined 1
to 1
the 1
materialistic 1
doctrines 1
of 1
the 1
Darwinismus 1
movement 1
in 1
Germany 1
and 1
found 1
a 1
curious 1
pleasure 1
in 1
tracing 1
the 1
thoughts 1
and 1
passions 1
of 1
men 1
to 1
some 1
pearly 1
cell 1
in 1
the 1
brain 1
or 1
some 1
white 1
nerve 1
in 1
the 1
body 1
delighting 1
in 1
the 1
conception 1
of 1
the 1
absolute 1
dependence 1
of 1
the 1
spirit 1
on 1
certain 1
physical 1
conditions 1
morbid 1
or 1
healthy 1
normal 1
or 1
diseased 1
Yet 1
as 1
has 1
been 1
said 1
of 1
him 1
before 1
no 1
theory 1
of 1
life 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
of 1
any 1
importance 1
compared 1
with 1
life 1
itself 1
He 1
felt 1
keenly 1
conscious 1
of 1
how 1
barren 1
all 1
intellectual 1
speculation 1
is 1
when 1
separated 1
from 1
action 1
and 1
experiment 1
He 1
knew 1
that 1
the 1
senses 1
no 1
less 1
than 1
the 1
soul 1
have 1
their 1
spiritual 1
mysteries 1
to 1
reveal 1
And 1
so 1
he 1
would 1
now 1
study 1
perfumes 1
and 1
the 1
secrets 1
of 1
their 1
manufacture 1
distilling 1
heavily 1
scented 1
oils 1
and 1
burning 1
odorous 1
gums 1
from 1
the 1
East 1
He 1
saw 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
mood 1
of 1
the 1
mind 1
that 1
had 1
not 1
its 1
counterpart 1
in 1
the 1
sensuous 1
life 1
and 1
set 1
himself 1
to 1
discover 1
their 1
true 1
relations 1
wondering 1
what 1
there 1
was 1
in 1
frankincense 1
that 1
made 1
one 1
mystical 1
and 1
in 1
ambergris 1
that 1
stirred 1
one 1
s 1
passions 1
and 1
in 1
violets 1
that 1
woke 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
dead 1
romances 1
and 1
in 1
musk 1
that 1
troubled 1
the 1
brain 1
and 1
in 1
champak 1
that 1
stained 1
the 1
imagination 1
and 1
seeking 1
often 1
to 1
elaborate 1
a 1
real 1
psychology 1
of 1
perfumes 1
and 1
to 1
estimate 1
the 1
several 1
influences 1
of 1
sweet 1
smelling 1
roots 1
and 1
scented 1
pollen 1
laden 1
flowers 1
of 1
aromatic 1
balms 1
and 1
of 1
dark 1
and 1
fragrant 1
woods 1
of 1
spikenard 1
that 1
sickens 1
of 1
hovenia 1
that 1
makes 1
men 1
mad 1
and 1
of 1
aloes 1
that 1
are 1
said 1
to 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
expel 1
melancholy 1
from 1
the 1
soul 1
At 1
another 1
time 1
he 1
devoted 1
himself 1
entirely 1
to 1
music 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
long 1
latticed 1
room 1
with 1
a 1
vermilion 1
and 1
gold 1
ceiling 1
and 1
walls 1
of 1
olive 1
green 1
lacquer 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
give 1
curious 1
concerts 1
in 1
which 1
mad 1
gipsies 1
tore 1
wild 1
music 1
from 1
little 1
zithers 1
or 1
grave 1
yellow 1
shawled 1
Tunisians 1
plucked 1
at 1
the 1
strained 1
strings 1
of 1
monstrous 1
lutes 1
while 1
grinning 1
Negroes 1
beat 1
monotonously 1
upon 1
copper 1
drums 1
and 1
crouching 1
upon 1
scarlet 1
mats 1
slim 1
turbaned 1
Indians 1
blew 1
through 1
long 1
pipes 1
of 1
reed 1
or 1
brass 1
and 1
charmed 1
or 1
feigned 1
to 1
charm 1
great 1
hooded 1
snakes 1
and 1
horrible 1
horned 1
adders 1
The 1
harsh 1
intervals 1
and 1
shrill 1
discords 1
of 1
barbaric 1
music 1
stirred 1
him 1
at 1
times 1
when 1
Schubert 1
s 1
grace 1
and 1
Chopin 1
s 1
beautiful 1
sorrows 1
and 1
the 1
mighty 1
harmonies 1
of 1
Beethoven 1
himself 1
fell 1
unheeded 1
on 1
his 1
ear 1
He 1
collected 1
together 1
from 1
all 1
parts 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
the 1
strangest 1
instruments 1
that 1
could 1
be 1
found 1
either 1
in 1
the 1
tombs 1
of 1
dead 1
nations 1
or 1
among 1
the 1
few 1
savage 1
tribes 1
that 1
have 1
survived 1
contact 1
with 1
Western 1
civilizations 1
and 1
loved 1
to 1
touch 1
and 1
try 1
them 1
He 1
had 1
the 1
mysterious 1
juruparis 1
of 1
the 1
Rio 1
Negro 1
Indians 1
that 1
women 1
are 1
not 1
allowed 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
and 1
that 1
even 1
youths 1
may 1
not 1
see 1
till 1
they 1
have 1
been 1
subjected 1
to 1
fasting 1
and 1
scourging 1
and 1
the 1
earthen 1
jars 1
of 1
the 1
Peruvians 1
that 1
have 1
the 1
shrill 1
cries 1
of 1
birds 1
and 1
flutes 1
of 1
human 1
bones 1
such 1
as 1
Alfonso 1
de 1
Ovalle 1
heard 1
in 1
Chile 1
and 1
the 1
sonorous 1
green 1
jaspers 1
that 1
are 1
found 1
near 1
Cuzco 1
and 1
give 1
forth 1
a 1
note 1
of 1
singular 1
sweetness 1
He 1
had 1
painted 1
gourds 1
filled 1
with 1
pebbles 1
that 1
rattled 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
shaken 1
the 1
long 1
clarin 1
of 1
the 1
Mexicans 1
into 1
which 1
the 1
performer 1
does 1
not 1
blow 1
but 1
through 1
which 1
he 1
inhales 1
the 1
air 1
the 1
harsh 1
ture 1
of 1
the 1
Amazon 1
tribes 1
that 1
is 1
sounded 1
by 1
the 1
sentinels 1
who 1
sit 1
all 1
day 1
long 1
in 1
high 1
trees 1
and 1
can 1
be 1
heard 1
it 1
is 1
said 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
of 1
three 1
leagues 1
the 1
teponaztli 1
that 1
has 1
two 1
vibrating 1
tongues 1
of 1
wood 1
and 1
is 1
beaten 1
with 1
sticks 1
that 1
are 1
smeared 1
with 1
an 1
elastic 1
gum 1
obtained 1
from 1
the 1
milky 1
juice 1
of 1
plants 1
the 1
yotl 1
bells 1
of 1
the 1
Aztecs 1
that 1
are 1
hung 1
in 1
clusters 1
like 1
grapes 1
and 1
a 1
huge 1
cylindrical 1
drum 1
covered 1
with 1
the 1
skins 1
of 1
great 1
serpents 1
like 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
Bernal 1
Diaz 1
saw 1
when 1
he 1
went 1
with 1
Cortes 1
into 1
the 1
Mexican 1
temple 1
and 1
of 1
whose 1
doleful 1
sound 1
he 1
has 1
left 1
us 1
so 1
vivid 1
a 1
description 1
The 1
fantastic 1
character 1
of 1
these 1
instruments 1
fascinated 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
felt 1
a 1
curious 1
delight 1
in 1
the 1
thought 1
that 1
art 1
like 1
Nature 1
has 1
her 1
monsters 1
things 1
of 1
bestial 1
shape 1
and 1
with 1
hideous 1
voices 1
Yet 1
after 1
some 1
time 1
he 1
wearied 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
would 1
sit 1
in 1
his 1
box 1
at 1
the 1
opera 1
either 1
alone 1
or 1
with 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
listening 1
in 1
rapt 1
pleasure 1
to 1
Tannhauser 1
and 1
seeing 1
in 1
the 1
prelude 1
to 1
that 1
great 1
work 1
of 1
art 1
a 1
presentation 1
of 1
the 1
tragedy 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
soul 1
On 1
one 1
occasion 1
he 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
study 1
of 1
jewels 1
and 1
appeared 1
at 1
a 1
costume 1
ball 1
as 1
Anne 1
de 1
Joyeuse 1
Admiral 1
of 1
France 1
in 1
a 1
dress 1
covered 1
with 1
five 1
hundred 1
and 1
sixty 1
pearls 1
This 1
taste 1
enthralled 1
him 1
for 1
years 1
and 1
indeed 1
may 1
be 1
said 1
never 1
to 1
have 1
left 1
him 1
He 1
would 1
often 1
spend 1
a 1
whole 1
day 1
settling 1
and 1
resettling 1
in 1
their 1
cases 1
the 1
various 1
stones 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
collected 1
such 1
as 1
the 1
olive 1
green 1
chrysoberyl 1
that 1
turns 1
red 1
by 1
lamplight 1
the 1
cymophane 1
with 1
its 1
wirelike 1
line 1
of 1
silver 1

and 1
violet 1
spinels 1
and 1
amethysts 1
with 1
their 1
alternate 1
layers 1
of 1
ruby 1
and 1
sapphire 1
He 1
loved 1
the 1
red 1
gold 1
of 1
the 1
sunstone 1
and 1
the 1
moonstone 1
s 1
pearly 1
whiteness 1
and 1
the 1
broken 1
rainbow 1
of 1
the 1
milky 1

He 1
procured 1
from 1
Amsterdam 1
three 1
emeralds 1
of 1
extraordinary 1
size 1
and 1
richness 1
of 1

had 1

was 1
the 1
envy 1
of 1
all 1
the 1

discovered 1
wonderful 1
stories 1
also 1
about 1

How 1
exquisite 1
life 1
had 1
once 1
been 1
How 1
gorgeous 1
in 1
its 1
pomp 1
and 1
decoration 1
Even 1
to 1
read 1
of 1
the 1
luxury 1
of 1
the 1
dead 1
was 1
wonderful 1
Then 1
he 1
turned 1
his 1
attention 1
to 1
embroideries 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
tapestries 1
that 1
performed 1
the 1
office 1
of 1
frescoes 1
in 1
the 1
chill 1
rooms 1
of 1
the 1
northern 1
nations 1
of 1
Europe 1
As 1
he 1
investigated 1
the 1
subject 1
and 1
he 1
always 1
had 1
an 1
extraordinary 1
faculty 1
of 1
becoming 1
absolutely 1
absorbed 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
in 1
whatever 1
he 1
took 1
up 1
he 1
was 1
almost 1
saddened 1
by 1
the 1
reflection 1
of 1
the 1
ruin 1
that 1
time 1
brought 1
on 1
beautiful 1
and 1
wonderful 1
things 1
He 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
had 1
escaped 1
that 1
Summer 1
followed 1
summer 1
and 1
the 1
yellow 1
jonquils 1
bloomed 1
and 1
died 1
many 1
times 1
and 1
nights 1
of 1
horror 1
repeated 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
their 1
shame 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
unchanged 1
No 1
winter 1
marred 1
his 1
face 1
or 1
stained 1
his 1
flowerlike 1
bloom 1
How 1
different 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
material 1
things 1
Where 1
had 1
they 1
passed 1
to 1
Where 1
was 1
the 1
great 1
crocus 1
coloured 1
robe 1
on 1
which 1
the 1
gods 1
fought 1
against 1
the 1
giants 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
worked 1
by 1
brown 1
girls 1
for 1
the 1
pleasure 1
of 1
Athena 1
Where 1
the 1
huge 1
velarium 1
that 1
Nero 1
had 1
stretched 1
across 1
the 1
Colosseum 1
at 1
Rome 1

Titan 1

of 1

mortuary 1
cloth 1
of 1
King 1
Chilperic 1
with 1
its 1
three 1
hundred 1

fantastic 1
robes 1
that 1
excited 1

of 1

were 1
figured 1
with 1

hunters 1
all 1
in 1
fact 1
that 1

can 1
copy 1
from 1
nature 1
and 1
the 1
coat 1
that 1
Charles 1
of 1
Orleans 1
once 1
wore 1
on 1
the 1
sleeves 1
of 1
which 1

at 1

He 1
had 1
a 1
special 1
passion 1
also 1
for 1
ecclesiastical 1
vestments 1
as 1
indeed 1
he 1
had 1
for 1

long 1

that 1
lined 1
the 1

of 1
his 1

had 1

many 1

is 1

He 1

The 1
orphreys 1
were 1
divided 1
into 1
panels 1
representing 1
scenes 1
from 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
the 1
Virgin 1
and 1
the 1
coronation 1
of 1
the 1
Virgin 1
was 1
figured 1
in 1
coloured 1
silks 1
upon 1
the 1
hood 1
This 1
was 1
Italian 1
work 1
of 1
the 1
fifteenth 1
century 1
Another 1
cope 1
was 1
of 1
green 1
velvet 1
embroidered 1
with 1
heart 1
shaped 1
groups 1
of 1
acanthus 1
leaves 1
from 1
which 1
spread 1
long 1
stemmed 1
white 1

the 1
details 1
of 1
which 1
were 1
picked 1

The 1
orphreys 1
were 1
woven 1
in 1
a 1
diaper 1
of 1
red 1
and 1
gold 1
silk 1
and 1
were 1
starred 1
with 1
medallions 1
of 1
many 1
saints 1
and 1
martyrs 1
among 1
whom 1
was 1
St 1
Sebastian 1
He 1
had 1
chasubles 1
also 1
of 1

coloured 1
silk 1
and 1
blue 1

and 1
gold 1

In 1
the 1
mystic 1
offices 1
to 1
which 1
such 1
things 1
were 1
put 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
that 1
quickened 1
his 1
imagination 1
For 1
these 1
treasures 1
and 1
everything 1
that 1
he 1
collected 1
in 1
his 1
lovely 1
house 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
to 1
him 1
means 1
of 1
forgetfulness 1
modes 1
by 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
escape 1
for 1
a 1
season 1
from 1
the 1
fear 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
at 1
times 1
to 1
be 1
almost 1
too 1
great 1
to 1
be 1
borne 1
Upon 1
the 1
walls 1
of 1
the 1
lonely 1
locked 1
room 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
spent 1
so 1
much 1
of 1
his 1
boyhood 1
he 1
had 1
hung 1
with 1
his 1
own 1
hands 1
the 1
terrible 1
portrait 1
whose 1
changing 1
features 1
showed 1
him 1
the 1
real 1
degradation 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
and 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
it 1
had 1
draped 1
the 1
purple 1
and 1
gold 1
pall 1
as 1
a 1
curtain 1
For 1
weeks 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
go 1
there 1
would 1
forget 1
the 1
hideous 1
painted 1
thing 1
and 1
get 1
back 1
his 1
light 1
heart 1
his 1
wonderful 1
joyousness 1
his 1
passionate 1
absorption 1
in 1
mere 1
existence 1
Then 1
suddenly 1
some 1
night 1
he 1
would 1
creep 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
dreadful 1
places 1
near 1
Blue 1
Gate 1
Fields 1
and 1
stay 1
there 1
day 1
after 1
day 1
until 1
he 1
was 1
driven 1
away 1
On 1
his 1
return 1
he 1
would 1
sit 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
picture 1
sometimes 1
loathing 1
it 1
and 1
himself 1
but 1
filled 1
at 1
other 1
times 1
with 1
that 1
pride 1
of 1
individualism 1
that 1
is 1
half 1
the 1
fascination 1
of 1
sin 1
and 1
smiling 1
with 1
secret 1
pleasure 1
at 1
the 1
misshapen 1
shadow 1
that 1
had 1
to 1
bear 1
the 1
burden 1
that 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
his 1
own 1
After 1
a 1
few 1
years 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
endure 1
to 1
be 1
long 1
out 1
of 1
England 1
and 1
gave 1
up 1
the 1
villa 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
shared 1
at 1
Trouville 1
with 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
the 1
little 1
white 1
walled 1
in 1
house 1
at 1
Algiers 1
where 1
they 1
had 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
spent 1
the 1
winter 1
He 1
hated 1
to 1
be 1
separated 1
from 1
the 1
picture 1
that 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
and 1
was 1
also 1
afraid 1
that 1
during 1
his 1
absence 1
some 1
one 1
might 1
gain 1
access 1
to 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
elaborate 1
bars 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
caused 1
to 1
be 1
placed 1
upon 1
the 1
door 1
He 1
was 1
quite 1
conscious 1
that 1
this 1
would 1
tell 1
them 1
nothing 1
It 1
was 1
true 1
that 1
the 1
portrait 1
still 1
preserved 1
under 1
all 1
the 1
foulness 1
and 1
ugliness 1
of 1
the 1
face 1
its 1
marked 1
likeness 1
to 1
himself 1
but 1
what 1
could 1
they 1
learn 1
from 1
that 1
He 1
would 1
laugh 1
at 1
any 1
one 1
who 1
tried 1
to 1
taunt 1
him 1
He 1
had 1
not 1
painted 1
it 1
What 1
was 1
it 1
to 1
him 1
how 1
vile 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
shame 1
it 1
looked 1
Even 1
if 1
he 1
told 1
them 1
would 1
they 1
believe 1
it 1
Yet 1
he 1
was 1
afraid 1
Sometimes 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
down 1
at 1
his 1
great 1
house 1
in 1
Nottinghamshire 1
entertaining 1
the 1
fashionable 1
young 1
men 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
rank 1
who 1
were 1
his 1
chief 1
companions 1
and 1
astounding 1
the 1
county 1
by 1
the 1
wanton 1
luxury 1
and 1
gorgeous 1
splendour 1
of 1
his 1
mode 1
of 1
life 1
he 1
would 1
suddenly 1
leave 1
his 1
guests 1
and 1
rush 1
back 1
to 1
town 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
door 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
tampered 1
with 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
picture 1
was 1
still 1
there 1
What 1
if 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
stolen 1
The 1
mere 1
thought 1
made 1
him 1
cold 1
with 1
horror 1
Surely 1
the 1
world 1
would 1
know 1
his 1
secret 1
then 1
Perhaps 1
the 1
world 1
already 1
suspected 1
it 1
For 1
while 1
he 1
fascinated 1
many 1
there 1
were 1
not 1
a 1
few 1
who 1
distrusted 1
him 1
He 1
was 1
very 1
nearly 1
blackballed 1
at 1
a 1
West 1
End 1
club 1
of 1
which 1
his 1
birth 1
and 1
social 1
position 1
fully 1
entitled 1
him 1
to 1
become 1
a 1
member 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
said 1
that 1
on 1
one 1
occasion 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
brought 1
by 1
a 1
friend 1
into 1
the 1
smoking 1
room 1
of 1
the 1
Churchill 1
the 1
Duke 1
of 1
Berwick 1
and 1
another 1
gentleman 1
got 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
marked 1
manner 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
Curious 1
stories 1
became 1
current 1
about 1
him 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
passed 1
his 1
twenty 1
fifth 1
year 1
It 1
was 1
rumoured 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
seen 1
brawling 1
with 1
foreign 1
sailors 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
den 1
in 1
the 1
distant 1
parts 1
of 1
Whitechapel 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
consorted 1
with 1
thieves 1
and 1
coiners 1
and 1
knew 1
the 1
mysteries 1
of 1
their 1
trade 1
His 1
extraordinary 1
absences 1
became 1
notorious 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
reappear 1
again 1
in 1
society 1
men 1
would 1
whisper 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
in 1
corners 1
or 1
pass 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
sneer 1
or 1
look 1
at 1
him 1
with 1
cold 1
searching 1
eyes 1
as 1
though 1
they 1
were 1
determined 1
to 1
discover 1
his 1
secret 1
Of 1
such 1
insolences 1
and 1
attempted 1
slights 1
he 1
of 1
course 1
took 1
no 1
notice 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
opinion 1
of 1
most 1
people 1
his 1
frank 1
debonair 1
manner 1
his 1
charming 1
boyish 1
smile 1
and 1
the 1
infinite 1
grace 1
of 1
that 1
wonderful 1
youth 1
that 1
seemed 1
never 1
to 1
leave 1
him 1
were 1
in 1
themselves 1
a 1
sufficient 1
answer 1
to 1
the 1
calumnies 1
for 1
so 1
they 1
termed 1
them 1
that 1
were 1
circulated 1
about 1
him 1
It 1
was 1
remarked 1
however 1
that 1
some 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
most 1
intimate 1
with 1
him 1
appeared 1
after 1
a 1
time 1
to 1
shun 1
him 1
Women 1
who 1
had 1
wildly 1
adored 1
him 1
and 1
for 1
his 1
sake 1
had 1
braved 1
all 1
social 1
censure 1
and 1
set 1
convention 1
at 1
defiance 1
were 1
seen 1
to 1
grow 1
pallid 1
with 1
shame 1
or 1
horror 1
if 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
Yet 1
these 1
whispered 1
scandals 1
only 1
increased 1
in 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
many 1
his 1
strange 1
and 1
dangerous 1
charm 1
His 1
great 1
wealth 1
was 1
a 1
certain 1
element 1
of 1
security 1
Society 1
civilized 1
society 1
at 1
least 1
is 1
never 1
very 1
ready 1
to 1
believe 1
anything 1
to 1
the 1
detriment 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
are 1
both 1
rich 1
and 1
fascinating 1
It 1
feels 1
instinctively 1
that 1
manners 1
are 1
of 1
more 1
importance 1
than 1
morals 1
and 1
in 1
its 1
opinion 1
the 1
highest 1
respectability 1
is 1
of 1
much 1
less 1
value 1
than 1
the 1
possession 1
of 1
a 1
good 1
chef 1
And 1
after 1
all 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
poor 1
consolation 1
to 1
be 1
told 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
has 1
given 1
one 1
a 1
bad 1
dinner 1
or 1
poor 1
wine 1
is 1
irreproachable 1
in 1
his 1
private 1
life 1
Even 1
the 1
cardinal 1
virtues 1
cannot 1
atone 1
for 1
half 1
cold 1
entrees 1
as 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
remarked 1
once 1
in 1
a 1
discussion 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
possibly 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
to 1
be 1
said 1
for 1
his 1
view 1
For 1
the 1
canons 1
of 1
good 1
society 1
are 1
or 1
should 1
be 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
the 1
canons 1
of 1
art 1
Form 1
is 1
absolutely 1
essential 1
to 1
it 1
It 1
should 1
have 1
the 1
dignity 1
of 1
a 1
ceremony 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
its 1
unreality 1
and 1
should 1
combine 1
the 1
insincere 1
character 1
of 1
a 1
romantic 1
play 1
with 1
the 1
wit 1
and 1
beauty 1
that 1
make 1
such 1
plays 1
delightful 1
to 1
us 1
Is 1
insincerity 1
such 1
a 1
terrible 1
thing 1
I 1
think 1
not 1
It 1
is 1
merely 1
a 1
method 1
by 1
which 1
we 1
can 1
multiply 1
our 1
personalities 1
Such 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
was 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
s 1
opinion 1
He 1
used 1
to 1
wonder 1
at 1
the 1
shallow 1
psychology 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
conceive 1
the 1
ego 1
in 1
man 1
as 1
a 1
thing 1
simple 1
permanent 1
reliable 1
and 1
of 1
one 1
essence 1
To 1
him 1
man 1
was 1
a 1
being 1
with 1
myriad 1
lives 1
and 1
myriad 1
sensations 1
a 1
complex 1
multiform 1
creature 1
that 1
bore 1
within 1
itself 1
strange 1
legacies 1
of 1
thought 1
and 1
passion 1
and 1
whose 1
very 1
flesh 1
was 1
tainted 1
with 1
the 1
monstrous 1
maladies 1
of 1
the 1
dead 1
He 1
loved 1
to 1
stroll 1
through 1
the 1
gaunt 1
cold 1
picture 1
gallery 1
of 1
his 1
country 1
house 1
and 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
various 1
portraits 1
of 1
those 1
whose 1
blood 1
flowed 1
in 1
his 1
veins 1
Here 1
was 1
Philip 1
Herbert 1
described 1
by 1
Francis 1
Osborne 1
in 1
his 1
Memoires 1
on 1
the 1
Reigns 1
of 1
Queen 1
Elizabeth 1
and 1
King 1
James 1
as 1
one 1
who 1
was 1
caressed 1
by 1
the 1
Court 1
for 1
his 1
handsome 1
face 1
which 1
kept 1
him 1
not 1
long 1
company 1
Was 1
it 1
young 1
Herbert 1
s 1
life 1
that 1
he 1
sometimes 1
led 1
Had 1
some 1
strange 1
poisonous 1
germ 1
crept 1
from 1
body 1
to 1
body 1
till 1
it 1
had 1
reached 1
his 1
own 1
Was 1
it 1
some 1
dim 1
sense 1
of 1
that 1
ruined 1
grace 1
that 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
so 1
suddenly 1
and 1
almost 1
without 1
cause 1
give 1
utterance 1
in 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
s 1
studio 1
to 1
the 1
mad 1
prayer 1
that 1
had 1
so 1
changed 1
his 1
life 1
Here 1
in 1
gold 1
embroidered 1
red 1
doublet 1
jewelled 1
surcoat 1
and 1
gilt 1
edged 1
ruff 1
and 1
wristbands 1
stood 1
Sir 1
Anthony 1
Sherard 1
with 1
his 1
silver 1
and 1
black 1

What 1
had 1
this 1
man 1
s 1
legacy 1
been 1
Had 1
the 1
lover 1
of 1
Giovanna 1
of 1
Naples 1
bequeathed 1
him 1
some 1
inheritance 1
of 1
sin 1
and 1
shame 1
Were 1
his 1
own 1
actions 1
merely 1
the 1
dreams 1
that 1
the 1
dead 1
man 1
had 1
not 1
dared 1
to 1
realize 1
Here 1
from 1
the 1
fading 1
canvas 1
smiled 1
Lady 1
Elizabeth 1
Devereux 1
in 1
her 1
gauze 1
hood 1
pearl 1
stomacher 1
and 1
pink 1
slashed 1
sleeves 1
A 1
flower 1
was 1
in 1
her 1
right 1
hand 1
and 1
her 1
left 1
clasped 1
an 1
enamelled 1
collar 1
of 1
white 1
and 1
damask 1
roses 1
On 1
a 1
table 1
by 1
her 1
side 1
lay 1
a 1
mandolin 1
and 1
an 1
apple 1
There 1
were 1
large 1
green 1
rosettes 1
upon 1
her 1
little 1
pointed 1
shoes 1
He 1
knew 1
her 1
life 1
and 1
the 1
strange 1
stories 1
that 1
were 1
told 1
about 1
her 1
lovers 1
Had 1
he 1
something 1
of 1
her 1
temperament 1
in 1
him 1
These 1
oval 1
heavy 1
lidded 1
eyes 1
seemed 1
to 1
look 1
curiously 1
at 1
him 1
What 1
of 1
George 1
Willoughby 1
with 1
his 1
powdered 1
hair 1
and 1
fantastic 1
patches 1
How 1
evil 1
he 1
looked 1
The 1
face 1
was 1
saturnine 1
and 1
swarthy 1
and 1
the 1
sensual 1
lips 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
twisted 1
with 1
disdain 1
Delicate 1
lace 1
ruffles 1
fell 1
over 1
the 1
lean 1
yellow 1
hands 1
that 1
were 1
so 1
overladen 1
with 1
rings 1
He 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
macaroni 1
of 1
the 1
eighteenth 1
century 1
and 1
the 1
friend 1
in 1
his 1
youth 1
of 1
Lord 1
Ferrars 1
What 1
of 1
the 1
second 1
Lord 1
Beckenham 1
the 1
companion 1
of 1
the 1
Prince 1
Regent 1
in 1
his 1
wildest 1
days 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
witnesses 1
at 1
the 1
secret 1
marriage 1
with 1
Mrs 1
Fitzherbert 1
How 1
proud 1
and 1
handsome 1
he 1
was 1
with 1
his 1
chestnut 1
curls 1
and 1
insolent 1
pose 1
What 1
passions 1
had 1
he 1
bequeathed 1
The 1
world 1
had 1
looked 1
upon 1
him 1
as 1
infamous 1
He 1
had 1
led 1
the 1
orgies 1
at 1
Carlton 1
House 1
The 1
star 1
of 1
the 1
Garter 1
glittered 1
upon 1
his 1
breast 1
Beside 1
him 1
hung 1
the 1
portrait 1
of 1
his 1
wife 1
a 1
pallid 1
thin 1
lipped 1
woman 1
in 1
black 1
Her 1
blood 1
also 1
stirred 1
within 1
him 1
How 1
curious 1
it 1
all 1
seemed 1
And 1
his 1
mother 1
with 1
her 1
Lady 1
Hamilton 1
face 1
and 1
her 1
moist 1
wine 1
dashed 1
lips 1
he 1
knew 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
got 1
from 1
her 1
He 1
had 1
got 1
from 1
her 1
his 1
beauty 1
and 1
his 1
passion 1
for 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
others 1
She 1
laughed 1
at 1
him 1
in 1
her 1
loose 1
Bacchante 1
dress 1
There 1
were 1
vine 1
leaves 1
in 1
her 1
hair 1
The 1
purple 1
spilled 1
from 1
the 1
cup 1
she 1
was 1
holding 1
The 1
carnations 1
of 1
the 1
painting 1
had 1
withered 1
but 1
the 1
eyes 1
were 1
still 1
wonderful 1
in 1
their 1
depth 1
and 1
brilliancy 1
of 1
colour 1
They 1
seemed 1
to 1
follow 1
him 1
wherever 1
he 1
went 1
Yet 1
one 1
had 1
ancestors 1
in 1
literature 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
in 1
one 1
s 1
own 1
race 1
nearer 1
perhaps 1
in 1
type 1
and 1
temperament 1
many 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
certainly 1
with 1
an 1
influence 1
of 1
which 1
one 1
was 1
more 1
absolutely 1
conscious 1
There 1
were 1
times 1
when 1
it 1
appeared 1
to 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
that 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
history 1
was 1
merely 1
the 1
record 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
life 1
not 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
lived 1
it 1
in 1
act 1
and 1
circumstance 1
but 1
as 1
his 1
imagination 1
had 1
created 1
it 1
for 1
him 1
as 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
his 1
brain 1
and 1
in 1
his 1
passions 1
He 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
known 1
them 1
all 1
those 1
strange 1
terrible 1
figures 1
that 1
had 1
passed 1
across 1
the 1
stage 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
made 1
sin 1
so 1
marvellous 1
and 1
evil 1
so 1
full 1
of 1
subtlety 1
It 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
in 1
some 1
mysterious 1
way 1
their 1
lives 1
had 1
been 1
his 1
own 1
The 1
hero 1
of 1
the 1
wonderful 1
novel 1
that 1
had 1
so 1
influenced 1
his 1
life 1
had 1
himself 1
known 1
this 1
curious 1
fancy 1
In 1
the 1
seventh 1
chapter 1
he 1
tells 1
how 1
crowned 1
with 1
laurel 1
lest 1
lightning 1
might 1
strike 1
him 1
he 1
had 1
sat 1
as 1
Tiberius 1
in 1
a 1
garden 1
at 1
Capri 1
reading 1
the 1
shameful 1
books 1
of 1
Elephantis 1
while 1
dwarfs 1
and 1
peacocks 1
strutted 1
round 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
flute 1
player 1
mocked 1
the 1
swinger 1
of 1
the 1
censer 1
and 1
as 1
Caligula 1
had 1
caroused 1
with 1
the 1
green 1
shirted 1
jockeys 1
in 1
their 1
stables 1
and 1
supped 1
in 1
an 1
ivory 1
manger 1
with 1
a 1
jewel 1
frontleted 1
horse 1
and 1
as 1
Domitian 1
had 1
wandered 1
through 1
a 1
corridor 1
lined 1
with 1
marble 1
mirrors 1
looking 1
round 1
with 1
haggard 1
eyes 1
for 1
the 1
reflection 1
of 1
the 1
dagger 1
that 1
was 1
to 1
end 1
his 1
days 1
and 1
sick 1
with 1
that 1
ennui 1
that 1
terrible 1
taedium 1
vitae 1
that 1
comes 1
on 1
those 1
to 1
whom 1
life 1
denies 1
nothing 1
and 1
had 1
peered 1
through 1
a 1
clear 1
emerald 1
at 1
the 1
red 1
shambles 1
of 1
the 1
circus 1
and 1
then 1
in 1
a 1
litter 1
of 1
pearl 1
and 1
purple 1
drawn 1
by 1
silver 1
shod 1
mules 1
been 1
carried 1
through 1
the 1
Street 1
of 1
Pomegranates 1
to 1
a 1
House 1
of 1
Gold 1
and 1
heard 1
men 1
cry 1
on 1
Nero 1
Caesar 1
as 1
he 1
passed 1
by 1
and 1
as 1
Elagabalus 1
had 1
painted 1
his 1
face 1
with 1
colours 1
and 1
plied 1
the 1
distaff 1
among 1
the 1
women 1
and 1
brought 1
the 1
Moon 1
from 1
Carthage 1
and 1
given 1
her 1
in 1
mystic 1
marriage 1
to 1
the 1
Sun 1
Over 1
and 1
over 1
again 1
Dorian 1
used 1
to 1
read 1
this 1
fantastic 1
chapter 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
chapters 1
immediately 1
following 1
in 1
which 1
as 1
in 1
some 1
curious 1
tapestries 1
or 1
cunningly 1
wrought 1
enamels 1
were 1
pictured 1
the 1
awful 1
and 1
beautiful 1
forms 1
of 1
those 1
whom 1
vice 1
and 1
blood 1
and 1
weariness 1
had 1
made 1
monstrous 1
or 1
mad 1
Filippo 1
Duke 1
of 1
Milan 1
who 1
slew 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
painted 1
her 1
lips 1
with 1
a 1
scarlet 1
poison 1
that 1
her 1
lover 1
might 1
suck 1
death 1
from 1
the 1
dead 1
thing 1
he 1
fondled 1
Pietro 1
Barbi 1
the 1
Venetian 1
known 1
as 1
Paul 1
the 1
Second 1
who 1
sought 1
in 1
his 1
vanity 1
to 1
assume 1
the 1
title 1
of 1
Formosus 1
and 1
whose 1
tiara 1
valued 1
at 1
two 1
hundred 1
thousand 1
florins 1
was 1
bought 1
at 1
the 1
price 1
of 1
a 1
terrible 1
sin 1
Gian 1
Maria 1
Visconti 1
who 1
used 1
hounds 1
to 1
chase 1
living 1
men 1
and 1
whose 1
murdered 1
body 1
was 1
covered 1
with 1
roses 1
by 1
a 1
harlot 1
who 1
had 1
loved 1
him 1
the 1
Borgia 1
on 1
his 1
white 1
horse 1
with 1
Fratricide 1
riding 1
beside 1
him 1
and 1
his 1
mantle 1
stained 1
with 1
the 1
blood 1
of 1
Perotto 1
Pietro 1
Riario 1
the 1
young 1
Cardinal 1
Archbishop 1
of 1
Florence 1
child 1
and 1
minion 1
of 1
Sixtus 1
IV 1
whose 1
beauty 1
was 1
equalled 1
only 1
by 1
his 1
debauchery 1
and 1
who 1
received 1
Leonora 1
of 1
Aragon 1
in 1
a 1
pavilion 1
of 1
white 1
and 1
crimson 1
silk 1
filled 1
with 1
nymphs 1
and 1
centaurs 1
and 1
gilded 1
a 1
boy 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
serve 1
at 1
the 1
feast 1
as 1
Ganymede 1
or 1
Hylas 1
Ezzelin 1
whose 1
melancholy 1
could 1
be 1
cured 1
only 1
by 1
the 1
spectacle 1
of 1
death 1
and 1
who 1
had 1
a 1
passion 1
for 1
red 1
blood 1
as 1
other 1
men 1
have 1
for 1
red 1
wine 1
the 1
son 1
of 1
the 1
Fiend 1
as 1
was 1
reported 1
and 1
one 1
who 1
had 1

at 1
dice 1
when 1
gambling 1
with 1

for 1
his 1

soul 1
Giambattista 1
Cibo 1
who 1
in 1
mockery 1
took 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
Innocent 1
and 1
into 1
whose 1
torpid 1
veins 1
the 1
blood 1
of 1
three 1
lads 1
was 1
infused 1
by 1
a 1
Jewish 1
doctor 1
Sigismondo 1
Malatesta 1
the 1
lover 1
of 1
Isotta 1
and 1
the 1
lord 1
of 1
Rimini 1
whose 1
effigy 1
was 1
burned 1
at 1
Rome 1
as 1
the 1
enemy 1
of 1
God 1
and 1
man 1
who 1
strangled 1
Polyssena 1
with 1

gave 1
poison 1
to 1
Ginevra 1

Charles 1
VI 1
who 1
had 1
so 1
wildly 1
adored 1
his 1
brother 1
s 1
wife 1
that 1
a 1
leper 1
had 1
warned 1
him 1
of 1
the 1
insanity 1
that 1
was 1
coming 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
who 1
when 1
his 1
brain 1
had 1
sickened 1
and 1
grown 1
strange 1
could 1
only 1
be 1
soothed 1
by 1
Saracen 1
cards 1
painted 1
with 1
the 1
images 1
of 1
love 1
and 1
death 1
and 1
madness 1

Baglioni 1
who 1
slew 1
Astorre 1
with 1
his 1
bride 1
and 1
Simonetto 1
with 1
his 1
page 1
and 1
whose 1
comeliness 1
was 1
such 1
that 1
as 1
he 1
lay 1
dying 1
in 1
the 1
yellow 1
piazza 1
of 1
Perugia 1
those 1
who 1
had 1
hated 1
him 1
could 1
not 1
choose 1
but 1
weep 1
and 1
Atalanta 1
who 1
had 1
cursed 1
him 1
blessed 1
him 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
horrible 1
fascination 1
in 1
them 1
all 1
He 1
saw 1
them 1
at 1
night 1
and 1
they 1
troubled 1
his 1
imagination 1
in 1
the 1
day 1
The 1
Renaissance 1
knew 1
of 1
strange 1
manners 1
of 1
poisoning 2
by 1
a 1
helmet 1
and 1
a 1
lighted 1
torch 1
by 1
an 1
embroidered 1
glove 1
and 1

fan 1
by 1
a 1
gilded 1
pomander 1
and 1
by 1
an 1
amber 1
chain 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
had 1
been 1
poisoned 1
by 1
a 1
book 1
There 1
were 1
moments 1
when 1
he 1
looked 1
on 1
evil 1
simply 1
as 1
a 1
mode 1
through 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
realize 1
his 1
conception 1
of 1
the 1
beautiful 1
CHAPTER 1
It 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
ninth 1
of 1
November 1
the 1
eve 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
thirty 1
eighth 1
birthday 1
as 1
he 1
often 1
remembered 1
afterwards 1
He 1
was 1
walking 1
home 1
about 1
eleven 1
o 1
clock 1
from 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
s 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
dining 1
and 1
was 1
wrapped 1
in 1
heavy 1
furs 1
as 1
the 1
night 1
was 1
cold 1
and 1
foggy 1
At 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
Grosvenor 1
Square 1
and 1
South 1
Audley 1
Street 1
a 1
man 1
passed 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
mist 1
walking 1
very 1
fast 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
collar 1
of 1
his 1
grey 1
ulster 1
turned 1
up 1
He 1
had 1
a 1
bag 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
Dorian 1
recognized 1
him 1
It 1
was 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
A 1
strange 1
sense 1
of 1
fear 1
for 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
account 1
came 1
over 1
him 1
He 1
made 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
recognition 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
quickly 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
house 1
But 1
Hallward 1
had 1
seen 1
him 1
Dorian 1
heard 1
him 1
first 1
stopping 1
on 1
the 1
pavement 1
and 1
then 1
hurrying 1
after 1
him 1
In 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
his 1
hand 1
was 1
on 1
his 1
arm 1
Dorian 1
What 1
an 1
extraordinary 1
piece 1
of 1
luck 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
waiting 1
for 1
you 1
in 1
your 1
library 1
ever 1
since 1
nine 1
o 1
clock 1
Finally 1
I 1
took 1
pity 1
on 1
your 1
tired 1
servant 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
bed 1
as 1
he 1
let 1
me 1
out 1
I 1
am 1
off 1
to 1
Paris 1
by 1
the 1
midnight 1
train 1
and 1
I 1
particularly 1
wanted 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
before 1
I 1
left 1
I 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
you 1
or 1
rather 1
your 1
fur 1
coat 1
as 1
you 1
passed 1
me 1
But 1
I 1
wasn 1
t 1
quite 1
sure 1
Didn 1
t 1
you 1
recognize 1
me 1
In 1
this 1
fog 1
my 1
dear 1
Basil 1
Why 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
even 1
recognize 1
Grosvenor 1
Square 1
I 1
believe 1
my 1
house 1
is 1
somewhere 1
about 1
here 1
but 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
feel 1
at 1
all 1
certain 1
about 1
it 1
I 1
am 1
sorry 1
you 1
are 1
going 1
away 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
seen 1
you 1
for 1
ages 1
But 1
I 1
suppose 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
back 1
soon 1
No 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
out 1
of 1
England 1
for 1
six 1
months 1
I 1
intend 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
studio 1
in 1
Paris 1
and 1
shut 1
myself 1
up 1
till 1
I 1
have 1
finished 1
a 1
great 1
picture 1
I 1
have 1
in 1
my 1
head 1
However 1
it 1
wasn 1
t 1
about 1
myself 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
talk 1
Here 1
we 1
are 1
at 1
your 1
door 1
Let 1
me 1
come 1
in 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
I 1
have 1
something 1
to 1
say 1
to 1
you 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
charmed 1
But 1
won 1
t 1
you 1
miss 1
your 1
train 1
said 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
languidly 1
as 1
he 1
passed 1
up 1
the 1
steps 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
his 1
latch 1
key 1
The 1
lamplight 1
struggled 1
out 1
through 1
the 1
fog 1
and 1
Hallward 1
looked 1
at 1
his 1
watch 1
I 1
have 1
heaps 1
of 1
time 1
he 1
answered 1
The 1
train 1
doesn 1
t 1
go 1
till 1
twelve 1
fifteen 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
just 1
eleven 1
In 1
fact 1
I 1
was 1
on 1
my 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
club 1
to 1
look 1
for 1
you 1
when 1
I 1
met 1
you 1
You 1
see 1
I 1
shan 1
t 1
have 1
any 1
delay 1
about 1
luggage 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
sent 1
on 1
my 1
heavy 1
things 1
All 1
I 1
have 1
with 1
me 1
is 1
in 1
this 1
bag 1
and 1
I 1
can 1
easily 1
get 1
to 1
Victoria 1
in 1
twenty 1
minutes 1
Dorian 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
smiled 1
What 1
a 1
way 1
for 1
a 1
fashionable 1
painter 1
to 1
travel 1
A 1
Gladstone 1
bag 1
and 1
an 1
ulster 1
Come 1
in 1
or 1
the 1
fog 1
will 1
get 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
And 1
mind 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
talk 1
about 1
anything 1
serious 1
Nothing 1
is 1
serious 1
nowadays 1
At 1
least 1
nothing 1
should 1
be 1
Hallward 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
as 1
he 1
entered 1
and 1
followed 1
Dorian 1
into 1
the 1
library 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
bright 1
wood 1
fire 1
blazing 1
in 1
the 1
large 1
open 1
hearth 1
The 1
lamps 1
were 1
lit 1
and 1
an 1
open 1
Dutch 1
silver 1
spirit 1
case 1
stood 1
with 1
some 1
siphons 1
of 1
soda 1
water 1
and 1
large 1
cut 1
glass 1
tumblers 1
on 1
a 1
little 1
marqueterie 1
table 1
You 1
see 1
your 1
servant 1
made 1
me 1
quite 1
at 1
home 1
Dorian 1
He 1
gave 1
me 1
everything 1
I 1
wanted 1
including 1
your 1
best 1
gold 1
tipped 1
cigarettes 1
He 1
is 1
a 1
most 1
hospitable 1
creature 1
I 1
like 1
him 1
much 1
better 1
than 1
the 1
Frenchman 1
you 1
used 1
to 1
have 1
What 1
has 1
become 1
of 1
the 1
Frenchman 1
by 1
the 1
bye 1
Dorian 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
I 1
believe 1
he 1
married 1
Lady 1
Radley 1
s 1
maid 1
and 1
has 1
established 1
her 1
in 1
Paris 1
as 1
an 1
English 1
dressmaker 1
Anglomania 1
is 1
very 1
fashionable 1
over 1
there 1
now 1
I 1
hear 1
It 1
seems 1
silly 1
of 1
the 1
French 1
doesn 1
t 1
it 1
But 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
a 1
bad 1
servant 1
I 1
never 1
liked 1
him 1
but 1
I 1
had 1
nothing 1
to 1
complain 1
about 1
One 1
often 1
imagines 1
things 1
that 1
are 1
quite 1
absurd 1
He 1
was 1
really 1
very 1
devoted 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
seemed 1
quite 1
sorry 1
when 1
he 1
went 1
away 1
Have 1
another 1
brandy 1
and 1
soda 1
Or 1
would 1
you 1
like 1
hock 1
and 1
seltzer 1
I 1
always 1
take 1
hock 1
and 1
seltzer 1
myself 1
There 1
is 1
sure 1
to 1
be 1
some 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
Thanks 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
have 1
anything 1
more 1
said 1
the 1
painter 1
taking 1
his 1
cap 1
and 1
coat 1
off 1
and 1
throwing 1
them 1
on 1
the 1
bag 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
placed 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
And 1
now 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
you 1
seriously 1
Don 1
t 1
frown 1
like 1
that 1
You 1
make 1
it 1
so 1
much 1
more 1
difficult 1
for 1
me 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
all 1
about 1
cried 1
Dorian 1
in 1
his 1
petulant 1
way 1
flinging 1
himself 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
sofa 1
I 1
hope 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
about 1
myself 1
I 1
am 1
tired 1
of 1
myself 1
to 1
night 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
be 1
somebody 1
else 1
It 1
is 1
about 1
yourself 1
answered 1
Hallward 1
in 1
his 1
grave 1
deep 1
voice 1
and 1
I 1
must 1
say 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
I 1
shall 1
only 1
keep 1
you 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
Dorian 1
sighed 1
and 1
lit 1
a 1
cigarette 1
Half 1
an 1
hour 1
he 1
murmured 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
much 1
to 1
ask 1
of 1
you 1
Dorian 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
entirely 1
for 1
your 1
own 1
sake 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
speaking 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
right 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
most 1
dreadful 1
things 1
are 1
being 1
said 1
against 1
you 1
in 1
London 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
wish 1
to 1
know 1
anything 1
about 1
them 1
I 1
love 1
scandals 1
about 1
other 1
people 1
but 1
scandals 1
about 1
myself 1
don 1
t 1
interest 1
me 1
They 1
have 1
not 1
got 1
the 1
charm 1
of 1
novelty 1
They 1
must 1
interest 1
you 1
Dorian 1
Every 1
gentleman 1
is 1
interested 1
in 1
his 1
good 1
name 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
people 1
to 1
talk 1
of 1
you 1
as 1
something 1
vile 1
and 1
degraded 1
Of 1
course 1
you 1
have 1
your 1
position 1
and 1
your 1
wealth 1
and 1
all 1
that 1
kind 1
of 1
thing 1
But 1
position 1
and 1
wealth 1
are 1
not 1
everything 1
Mind 1
you 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
believe 1
these 1
rumours 1
at 1
all 1
At 1
least 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
believe 1
them 1
when 1
I 1
see 1
you 1
Sin 1
is 1
a 1
thing 1
that 1
writes 1
itself 1
across 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
face 1
It 1
cannot 1
be 1
concealed 1
People 1
talk 1
sometimes 1
of 1
secret 1
vices 1
There 1
are 1
no 1
such 1
things 1
If 1
a 1
wretched 1
man 1
has 1
a 1
vice 1
it 1
shows 1
itself 1
in 1
the 1
lines 1
of 1
his 1
mouth 1
the 1
droop 1
of 1
his 1
eyelids 1
the 1
moulding 1
of 1
his 1
hands 1
even 1
Somebody 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
mention 1
his 1
name 1
but 1
you 1
know 1
him 1
came 1
to 1
me 1
last 1
year 1
to 1
have 1
his 1
portrait 1
done 1
I 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
him 1
before 1
and 1
had 1
never 1
heard 1
anything 1
about 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
though 1
I 1
have 1
heard 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
since 1
He 1
offered 1
an 1
extravagant 1
price 1
I 1
refused 1
him 1
There 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
his 1
fingers 1
that 1
I 1
hated 1
I 1
know 1
now 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
quite 1
right 1
in 1
what 1
I 1
fancied 1
about 1
him 1
His 1
life 1
is 1
dreadful 1
But 1
you 1
Dorian 1
with 1
your 1
pure 1
bright 1
innocent 1
face 1
and 1
your 1
marvellous 1
untroubled 1
youth 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
believe 1
anything 1
against 1
you 1
And 1
yet 1
I 1
see 1
you 1
very 1
seldom 1
and 1
you 1
never 1
come 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
studio 1
now 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
am 1
away 1
from 1
you 1
and 1
I 1
hear 1
all 1
these 1
hideous 1
things 1
that 1
people 1
are 1
whispering 1
about 1
you 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
Why 1
is 1
it 1
Dorian 1
that 1
a 1
man 1
like 1
the 1
Duke 1
of 1
Berwick 1
leaves 1
the 1
room 1
of 1
a 1
club 1
when 1
you 1
enter 1
it 1
Why 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
so 1
many 1
gentlemen 1
in 1
London 1
will 1
neither 1
go 1
to 1
your 1
house 1
or 1
invite 1
you 1
to 1
theirs 1
You 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
friend 1
of 1
Lord 1
Staveley 1
I 1
met 1
him 1
at 1
dinner 1
last 1
week 1
Your 1
name 1
happened 1
to 1
come 1
up 1
in 1
conversation 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
the 1
miniatures 1
you 1
have 1
lent 1
to 1
the 1
exhibition 1
at 1
the 1
Dudley 1
Staveley 1
curled 1
his 1
lip 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
you 1
might 1
have 1
the 1
most 1
artistic 1
tastes 1
but 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
a 1
man 1
whom 1
no 1
pure 1
minded 1
girl 1
should 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
know 1
and 1
whom 1
no 1
chaste 1
woman 1
should 1
sit 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
room 1
with 1
I 1
reminded 1
him 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
friend 1
of 1
yours 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
what 1
he 1
meant 1
He 1
told 1
me 1
He 1
told 1
me 1
right 1
out 1
before 1
everybody 1
It 1
was 1
horrible 1
Why 1
is 1
your 1
friendship 1
so 1
fatal 1
to 1
young 1
men 1
There 1
was 1
that 1
wretched 1
boy 1
in 1
the 1
Guards 1
who 1
committed 1
suicide 1
You 1
were 1
his 1
great 1
friend 1
There 1
was 1
Sir 1
Henry 1
Ashton 1
who 1
had 1
to 1
leave 1
England 1
with 1
a 1
tarnished 1
name 1
You 1
and 1
he 1
were 1
inseparable 1
What 1
about 1
Adrian 1
Singleton 1
and 1
his 1
dreadful 1
end 1
What 1
about 1
Lord 1
Kent 1
s 1
only 1
son 1
and 1
his 1
career 1
I 1
met 1
his 1
father 1
yesterday 1
in 1
St 1
James 1
s 1
Street 1
He 1
seemed 1
broken 1
with 1
shame 1
and 1
sorrow 1
What 1
about 1
the 1
young 1
Duke 1
of 1
Perth 1
What 1
sort 1
of 1
life 1
has 1
he 1
got 1
now 1
What 1
gentleman 1
would 1
associate 1
with 1
him 1
Stop 1
Basil 1
You 1
are 1
talking 1
about 1
things 1
of 1
which 1
you 1
know 1
nothing 1
said 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
biting 1
his 1
lip 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
note 1
of 1
infinite 1
contempt 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
You 1
ask 1
me 1
why 1
Berwick 1
leaves 1
a 1
room 1
when 1
I 1
enter 1
it 1
It 1
is 1
because 1
I 1
know 1
everything 1
about 1
his 1
life 1
not 1
because 1
he 1
knows 1
anything 1
about 1
mine 1
With 1
such 1
blood 1
as 1
he 1
has 1
in 1
his 1
veins 1
how 1
could 1
his 1
record 1
be 1
clean 1
You 1
ask 1
me 1
about 1
Henry 1
Ashton 1
and 1
young 1
Perth 1
Did 1
I 1
teach 1
the 1
one 1
his 1
vices 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
his 1
debauchery 1
If 1
Kent 1
s 1
silly 1
son 1
takes 1
his 1
wife 1
from 1
the 1
streets 1
what 1
is 1
that 1
to 1
me 1
If 1
Adrian 1
Singleton 1
writes 1
his 1
friend 1
s 1
name 1
across 1
a 1
bill 1
am 1
I 1
his 1
keeper 1
I 1
know 1
how 1
people 1
chatter 1
in 1
England 1
The 1
middle 1
classes 1
air 1
their 1
moral 1
prejudices 1
over 1
their 1
gross 1
dinner 1
tables 1
and 1
whisper 1
about 1
what 1
they 1
call 1
the 1
profligacies 1
of 1
their 1
betters 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
pretend 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
in 1
smart 1
society 1
and 1
on 1
intimate 1
terms 1
with 1
the 1
people 1
they 1
slander 1
In 1
this 1
country 1
it 1
is 1
enough 1
for 1
a 1
man 1
to 1
have 1
distinction 1
and 1
brains 1
for 1
every 1
common 1
tongue 1
to 1
wag 1
against 1
him 1
And 1
what 1
sort 1
of 1
lives 1
do 1
these 1
people 1
who 1
pose 1
as 1
being 1
moral 1
lead 1
themselves 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
you 1
forget 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
in 1
the 1
native 1
land 1
of 1
the 1
hypocrite 1
Dorian 1
cried 1
Hallward 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
question 1
England 1
is 1
bad 1
enough 1
I 1
know 1
and 1
English 1
society 1
is 1
all 1
wrong 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
reason 1
why 1
I 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
fine 1
You 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
fine 1
One 1
has 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
judge 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
by 1
the 1
effect 1
he 1
has 1
over 1
his 1
friends 1
Yours 1
seem 1
to 1
lose 1
all 1
sense 1
of 1
honour 1
of 1
goodness 1
of 1
purity 1
You 1
have 1
filled 1
them 1
with 1
a 1
madness 1
for 1
pleasure 1
They 1
have 1
gone 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
depths 1
You 1
led 1
them 1
there 1
Yes 1
you 1
led 1
them 1
there 1
and 1
yet 1
you 1
can 1
smile 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
smiling 1
now 1
And 1
there 1
is 1
worse 1
behind 1
I 1
know 1
you 1
and 1
Harry 1
are 1
inseparable 1
Surely 1
for 1
that 1
reason 1
if 1
for 1
none 1
other 1
you 1
should 1
not 1
have 1
made 1
his 1
sister 1
s 1
name 1
a 1
by 1
word 1
Take 1
care 1
Basil 1
You 1
go 1
too 1
far 1
I 1
must 1
speak 1
and 1
you 1
must 1
listen 1
You 1
shall 1
listen 1
When 1
you 1
met 1
Lady 1
Gwendolen 1
not 1
a 1
breath 1
of 1
scandal 1
had 1
ever 1
touched 1
her 1
Is 1
there 1
a 1
single 1
decent 1
woman 1
in 1
London 1
now 1
who 1
would 1
drive 1
with 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
park 1
Why 1
even 1
her 1
children 1
are 1
not 1
allowed 1
to 1
live 1
with 1
her 1
Then 1
there 1
are 1
other 1
stories 2
that 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
seen 1
creeping 1
at 1
dawn 1
out 1
of 1
dreadful 1
houses 1
and 1
slinking 1
in 1
disguise 1
into 1
the 1
foulest 1
dens 1
in 1
London 1
Are 1
they 1
true 1
Can 1
they 1
be 1
true 1
When 1
I 1
first 1
heard 1
them 1
I 1
laughed 1
I 1
hear 1
them 1
now 1
and 1
they 1
make 1
me 1
shudder 1
What 1
about 1
your 1
country 1
house 1
and 1
the 1
life 1
that 1
is 1
led 1
there 1
Dorian 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
is 1
said 1
about 1
you 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
preach 1
to 1
you 1
I 1
remember 1
Harry 1
saying 1
once 1
that 1
every 1
man 1
who 1
turned 1
himself 1
into 1
an 1
amateur 1
curate 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
always 1
began 1
by 1
saying 1
that 1
and 1
then 1
proceeded 1
to 1
break 1
his 1
word 1
I 1
do 1
want 1
to 1
preach 1
to 1
you 1
I 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
lead 1
such 1
a 1
life 1
as 1
will 1
make 1
the 1
world 1
respect 1
you 1
I 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
clean 1
name 1
and 1
a 1
fair 1
record 1
I 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
the 1
dreadful 1
people 1
you 1
associate 1
with 1
Don 1
t 1
shrug 1
your 1
shoulders 1
like 1
that 1
Don 1
t 1
be 1
so 1
indifferent 1
You 1
have 1
a 1
wonderful 1
influence 1
Let 1
it 1
be 1
for 1
good 1
not 1
for 1
evil 1
They 1
say 1
that 1
you 1
corrupt 1
every 1
one 1
with 1
whom 1
you 1
become 1
intimate 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
sufficient 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
enter 1
a 1
house 1
for 1
shame 1
of 1
some 1
kind 1
to 1
follow 1
after 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
whether 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
or 1
not 1
How 1
should 1
I 1
know 1
But 1
it 1
is 1
said 1
of 1
you 1
I 1
am 1
told 1
things 1
that 1
it 1
seems 1
impossible 1
to 1
doubt 1
Lord 1
Gloucester 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
greatest 1
friends 1
at 1
Oxford 1
He 1
showed 1
me 1
a 1
letter 1
that 1
his 1
wife 1
had 1
written 1
to 1
him 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
dying 1
alone 1
in 1
her 1
villa 1
at 1
Mentone 1
Your 1
name 1
was 1
implicated 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
terrible 1
confession 1
I 1
ever 1
read 1
I 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
absurd 1
that 1
I 1
knew 1
you 1
thoroughly 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
incapable 1
of 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
Know 1
you 1
I 1
wonder 1
do 1
I 1
know 1
you 1
Before 1
I 1
could 1
answer 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
to 1
see 1
your 1
soul 1
To 1
see 1
my 1
soul 1
muttered 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
starting 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
sofa 1
and 1
turning 1
almost 1
white 1
from 1
fear 1
Yes 1
answered 1
Hallward 1
gravely 1
and 1
with 1
deep 1
toned 1
sorrow 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
to 1
see 1
your 1
soul 1
But 1
only 1
God 1
can 1
do 1
that 1
A 1
bitter 1
laugh 1
of 1
mockery 1
broke 1
from 1
the 1
lips 1
of 1
the 1
younger 1
man 1
You 1
shall 1
see 1
it 1
yourself 1
to 1
night 1
he 1
cried 1
seizing 1
a 1
lamp 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
Come 1
it 1
is 1
your 1
own 1
handiwork 1
Why 1
shouldn 1
t 1
you 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
You 1
can 1
tell 1
the 1
world 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
afterwards 1
if 1
you 1
choose 1
Nobody 1
would 1
believe 1
you 1
If 1
they 1
did 1
believe 1
you 1
they 1
would 1
like 1
me 1
all 1
the 1
better 1
for 1
it 1
I 1
know 1
the 1
age 1
better 1
than 1
you 1
do 1
though 1
you 1
will 1
prate 1
about 1
it 1
so 1
tediously 1
Come 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
You 1
have 1
chattered 1
enough 1
about 1
corruption 1
Now 1
you 1
shall 1
look 1
on 1
it 1
face 1
to 1
face 1
There 1
was 1
the 1
madness 1
of 1
pride 1
in 1
every 1
word 1
he 1
uttered 1
He 1
stamped 1
his 1
foot 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
in 1
his 1
boyish 1
insolent 1
manner 1
He 1
felt 1
a 1
terrible 1
joy 1
at 1
the 1
thought 1
that 1
some 1
one 1
else 1
was 1
to 1
share 1
his 1
secret 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
painted 1
the 1
portrait 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
origin 1
of 1
all 1
his 1
shame 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
burdened 1
for 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
with 1
the 1
hideous 1
memory 1
of 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
Yes 1
he 1
continued 1
coming 1
closer 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
looking 1
steadfastly 1
into 1
his 1
stern 1
eyes 1
I 1
shall 1
show 1
you 1
my 1
soul 1
You 1
shall 1
see 1
the 1
thing 1
that 1
you 1
fancy 1
only 1
God 1
can 1
see 1
Hallward 1
started 1
back 1
This 1
is 1
blasphemy 1
Dorian 1
he 1
cried 1
You 1
must 1
not 1
say 1
things 1
like 1
that 1
They 1
are 1
horrible 1
and 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
mean 1
anything 1
You 1
think 1
so 1
He 1
laughed 1
again 1
I 1
know 1
so 1
As 1
for 1
what 1
I 1
said 1
to 1
you 1
to 1
night 1
I 1
said 1
it 1
for 1
your 1
good 1
You 1
know 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
always 1
a 1
stanch 1
friend 1
to 1
you 1
Don 1
t 1
touch 1
me 1
Finish 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
say 1
A 1
twisted 1
flash 1
of 1
pain 1
shot 1
across 1
the 1
painter 1
s 1
face 1
He 1
paused 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
a 1
wild 1
feeling 1
of 1
pity 1
came 1
over 1
him 1
After 1
all 1
what 1
right 1
had 1
he 1
to 1
pry 1
into 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
If 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
a 1
tithe 1
of 1
what 1
was 1
rumoured 1
about 1
him 1
how 1
much 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
suffered 1
Then 1
he 1
straightened 1
himself 1
up 1
and 1
walked 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
fire 1
place 1
and 1
stood 1
there 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
burning 1
logs 1
with 1
their 1
frostlike 1
ashes 1
and 1
their 1
throbbing 1
cores 1
of 1
flame 1
I 1
am 1
waiting 1
Basil 1
said 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
in 1
a 1
hard 1
clear 1
voice 1
He 1
turned 1
round 1
What 1
I 1
have 1
to 1
say 1
is 1
this 1
he 1
cried 1
You 1
must 1
give 1
me 1
some 1
answer 1
to 1
these 1
horrible 1
charges 1
that 1
are 1
made 1
against 1
you 1
If 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
absolutely 1
untrue 1
from 1
beginning 1
to 1
end 1
I 1
shall 1
believe 1
you 1
Deny 1
them 1
Dorian 1
deny 1
them 1
Can 1
t 1
you 1
see 1
what 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
through 1
My 1
God 1
don 1
t 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
bad 1
and 1
corrupt 1
and 1
shameful 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
smiled 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
curl 1
of 1
contempt 1
in 1
his 1
lips 1
Come 1
upstairs 1
Basil 1
he 1
said 1
quietly 1
I 1
keep 1
a 1
diary 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
from 1
day 1
to 1
day 1
and 1
it 1
never 1
leaves 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
which 1
it 1
is 1
written 1
I 1
shall 1
show 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
I 1
shall 1
come 1
with 1
you 1
Dorian 1
if 1
you 1
wish 1
it 1
I 1
see 1
I 1
have 1
missed 1
my 1
train 1
That 1
makes 1
no 1
matter 1
I 1
can 1
go 1
to 1
morrow 1
But 1
don 1
t 1
ask 1
me 1
to 1
read 1
anything 1
to 1
night 1
All 1
I 1
want 1
is 1
a 1
plain 1
answer 1
to 1
my 1
question 1
That 1
shall 1
be 1
given 1
to 1
you 1
upstairs 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
give 1
it 1
here 1
You 1
will 1
not 1
have 1
to 1
read 1
long 1
CHAPTER 1
He 1
passed 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
began 1
the 1
ascent 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
following 1
close 1
behind 1
They 1
walked 1
softly 1
as 1
men 1
do 1
instinctively 1
at 1
night 1
The 1
lamp 1
cast 1
fantastic 1
shadows 1
on 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
staircase 1
A 1
rising 1
wind 1
made 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
windows 1
rattle 1
When 1
they 1
reached 1
the 1
top 1
landing 1
Dorian 1
set 1
the 1
lamp 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
taking 1
out 1
the 1
key 1
turned 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
You 1
insist 1
on 1
knowing 1
Basil 1
he 1
asked 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
voice 1
Yes 1
I 1
am 1
delighted 1
he 1
answered 1
smiling 1
Then 1
he 1
added 1
somewhat 1
harshly 1
You 1
are 1
the 1
one 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
who 1
is 1
entitled 1
to 1
know 1
everything 1
about 1
me 1
You 1
have 1
had 1
more 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
my 1
life 1
than 1
you 1
think 1
and 1
taking 1
up 1
the 1
lamp 1
he 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
went 1
in 1
A 1
cold 1
current 1
of 1
air 1
passed 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
light 1
shot 1
up 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
in 1
a 1
flame 1
of 1
murky 1
orange 1
He 1
shuddered 1
Shut 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
you 1
he 1
whispered 1
as 1
he 1
placed 1
the 1
lamp 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
Hallward 1
glanced 1
round 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
puzzled 1
expression 1
The 1
room 1
looked 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
lived 1
in 1
for 1
years 1
A 1
faded 1
Flemish 1
tapestry 1
a 1
curtained 1
picture 1
an 1
old 1
Italian 1
cassone 1
and 1
an 1
almost 1
empty 1
book 1
case 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
that 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
contain 1
besides 1
a 1
chair 1
and 1
a 1
table 1
As 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
was 1
lighting 1
a 1
half 1
burned 1
candle 1
that 1
was 1
standing 1
on 1
the 1
mantelshelf 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
whole 1
place 1
was 1
covered 1
with 1
dust 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
carpet 1
was 1
in 1
holes 1
A 1
mouse 1
ran 1
scuffling 1
behind 1
the 1
wainscoting 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
damp 1
odour 1
of 1
mildew 1
So 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
God 1
who 1
sees 1
the 1
soul 1
Basil 1
Draw 1
that 1
curtain 1
back 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
mine 1
The 1
voice 1
that 1
spoke 1
was 1
cold 1
and 1
cruel 1
You 1
are 1
mad 1
Dorian 1
or 1
playing 1
a 1
part 1
muttered 1
Hallward 1
frowning 1
You 1
won 1
t 1
Then 1
I 1
must 1
do 1
it 1
myself 1
said 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
and 1
he 1
tore 1
the 1
curtain 1
from 1
its 1
rod 1
and 1
flung 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
An 1
exclamation 1
of 1
horror 1
broke 1
from 1
the 1
painter 1
s 1
lips 1
as 1
he 1
saw 1
in 1
the 1
dim 1
light 1
the 1
hideous 1
face 1
on 1
the 1
canvas 1
grinning 1
at 1
him 1
There 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
its 1
expression 1
that 1
filled 1
him 1
with 1
disgust 1
and 1
loathing 1
Good 1
heavens 1
it 1
was 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
s 1
own 1
face 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
looking 1
at 1
The 1
horror 1
whatever 1
it 1
was 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
entirely 1
spoiled 1
that 1
marvellous 1
beauty 1
There 1
was 1
still 1
some 1
gold 1
in 1
the 1
thinning 1
hair 1
and 1
some 1
scarlet 1
on 1
the 1
sensual 1
mouth 1
The 1
sodden 1
eyes 1
had 1
kept 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
loveliness 1
of 1
their 1
blue 1
the 1
noble 1
curves 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
completely 1
passed 1
away 1
from 1
chiselled 1
nostrils 1
and 1
from 1
plastic 1
throat 1
Yes 1
it 1
was 1
Dorian 1
himself 1
But 1
who 1
had 1
done 1
it 1
He 1
seemed 1
to 1
recognize 1
his 1
own 1
brushwork 1
and 1
the 1
frame 1
was 1
his 1
own 1
design 1
The 1
idea 1
was 1
monstrous 1
yet 1
he 1
felt 1
afraid 1
He 1
seized 1
the 1
lighted 1
candle 1
and 1
held 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
picture 1
In 1
the 1
left 1
hand 1
corner 1
was 1
his 1
own 1
name 1
traced 1
in 1
long 1
letters 1
of 1
bright 1
vermilion 1
It 1
was 1
some 1
foul 1
parody 1
some 1
infamous 1
ignoble 1
satire 1
He 1
had 1
never 1
done 1
that 1
Still 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
own 1
picture 1
He 1
knew 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
his 1
blood 1
had 1
changed 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
from 1
fire 1
to 1
sluggish 1
ice 1
His 1
own 1
picture 1
What 1
did 1
it 1
mean 1
Why 1
had 1
it 1
altered 1
He 1
turned 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
with 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
a 1
sick 1
man 1
His 1
mouth 1
twitched 1
and 1
his 1
parched 1
tongue 1
seemed 1
unable 1
to 1
articulate 1
He 1
passed 1
his 1
hand 1
across 1
his 1
forehead 1
It 1
was 1
dank 1
with 1
clammy 1
sweat 1
The 1
young 1
man 1
was 1
leaning 1
against 1
the 1
mantelshelf 1
watching 1
him 1
with 1
that 1
strange 1
expression 1
that 1
one 1
sees 1
on 1
the 1
faces 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
are 1
absorbed 1
in 1
a 1
play 1
when 1
some 1
great 1
artist 1
is 1
acting 1
There 1
was 1
neither 1
real 1
sorrow 1
in 1
it 1
nor 1
real 1
joy 1
There 1
was 1
simply 1
the 1
passion 1
of 1
the 1
spectator 1
with 1
perhaps 1
a 1
flicker 1
of 1
triumph 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
He 1
had 1
taken 1
the 1
flower 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
coat 1
and 1
was 1
smelling 1
it 1
or 1
pretending 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
What 1
does 1
this 1
mean 1
cried 1
Hallward 1
at 1
last 1
His 1
own 1
voice 1
sounded 1
shrill 1
and 1
curious 1
in 1
his 1
ears 1
Years 1
ago 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
boy 1
said 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
crushing 1
the 1
flower 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
you 1
met 1
me 1
flattered 1
me 1
and 1
taught 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
vain 1
of 1
my 1
good 1
looks 1
One 1
day 1
you 1
introduced 1
me 1
to 1
a 1
friend 1
of 1
yours 1
who 1
explained 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
wonder 1
of 1
youth 1
and 1
you 1
finished 1
a 1
portrait 1
of 1
me 1
that 1
revealed 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
wonder 1
of 1
beauty 1
In 1
a 1
mad 1
moment 1
that 1
even 1
now 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
whether 1
I 1
regret 1
or 1
not 1
I 1
made 1
a 1
wish 1
perhaps 1
you 1
would 1
call 1
it 1
a 1
prayer 1
I 1
remember 1
it 1
Oh 1
how 1
well 1
I 1
remember 1
it 1
No 1
the 1
thing 1
is 1
impossible 1
The 1
room 1
is 1
damp 1
Mildew 1
has 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
canvas 1
The 1
paints 1
I 1
used 1
had 1
some 1
wretched 1
mineral 1
poison 1
in 1
them 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
the 1
thing 1
is 1
impossible 1
Ah 1
what 1
is 1
impossible 1
murmured 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
going 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
leaning 1
his 1
forehead 1
against 1
the 1
cold 1
mist 1
stained 1
glass 1
You 1
told 1
me 1
you 1
had 1
destroyed 1
it 1
I 1
was 1
wrong 1
It 1
has 1
destroyed 1
me 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
believe 1
it 1
is 1
my 1
picture 1
Can 1
t 1
you 1
see 1
your 1
ideal 1
in 1
it 1
said 1
Dorian 1
bitterly 1
My 1
ideal 1
as 1
you 1
call 1
it 1
As 1
you 1
called 1
it 1
There 1
was 1
nothing 1
evil 1
in 1
it 1
nothing 1
shameful 1
You 1
were 1
to 1
me 1
such 1
an 1
ideal 1
as 1
I 1
shall 1
never 1
meet 1
again 1
This 1
is 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
a 1
satyr 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
my 1
soul 1
Christ 1
what 1
a 1
thing 1
I 1
must 1
have 1
worshipped 1
It 1
has 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
a 1
devil 1
Each 1
of 1
us 1
has 1
heaven 1
and 1
hell 1
in 1
him 1
Basil 1
cried 1
Dorian 1
with 1
a 1
wild 1
gesture 1
of 1
despair 1
Hallward 1
turned 1
again 1
to 1
the 1
portrait 1
and 1
gazed 1
at 1
it 1
My 1
God 1
If 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
he 1
exclaimed 1
and 1
this 1
is 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
done 1
with 1
your 1
life 1
why 1
you 1
must 1
be 1
worse 1
even 1
than 1
those 1
who 1
talk 1
against 1
you 1
fancy 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
He 1
held 1
the 1
light 1
up 1
again 1
to 1
the 1
canvas 1
and 1
examined 1
it 1
The 1
surface 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
quite 1
undisturbed 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
it 1
It 1
was 1
from 1
within 1
apparently 1
that 1
the 1
foulness 1
and 1
horror 1
had 1
come 1
Through 1
some 1
strange 1
quickening 1
of 1
inner 1
life 1
the 1
leprosies 1
of 1
sin 1
were 1
slowly 1
eating 1
the 1
thing 1
away 1
The 1
rotting 1
of 1
a 1
corpse 1
in 1
a 1
watery 1
grave 1
was 1
not 1
so 1
fearful 1
His 1
hand 1
shook 1
and 1
the 1
candle 1
fell 1
from 1
its 1
socket 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
lay 1
there 1
sputtering 1
He 1
placed 1
his 1
foot 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
out 1
Then 1
he 1
flung 1
himself 1
into 1
the 1
rickety 1
chair 1
that 1
was 1
standing 1
by 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
buried 1
his 1
face 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
Good 1
God 1
Dorian 1
what 1
a 1
lesson 1
What 1
an 1
awful 1
lesson 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
answer 1
but 1
he 1
could 1
hear 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
sobbing 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
Pray 1
Dorian 1
pray 1
he 1
murmured 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
one 1
was 1
taught 1
to 1
say 1
in 1
one 1
s 1
boyhood 1
Lead 1
us 1
not 1
into 1
temptation 1
Forgive 1
us 1
our 1
sins 1
Wash 1
away 1
our 1
iniquities 1
Let 1
us 1
say 1
that 1
together 1
The 1
prayer 1
of 1
your 1
pride 1
has 1
been 1
answered 1
The 1
prayer 1
of 1
your 1
repentance 1
will 1
be 1
answered 1
also 1
I 1
worshipped 1
you 1
too 1
much 1
I 1
am 1
punished 1
for 1
it 1
You 1
worshipped 1
yourself 1
too 1
much 1
We 1
are 1
both 1
punished 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
turned 1
slowly 1
around 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
with 1
tear 1
dimmed 1
eyes 1
It 1
is 1
too 1
late 1
Basil 1
he 1
faltered 1
It 1
is 1
never 1
too 1
late 1
Dorian 1
Let 1
us 1
kneel 1
down 1
and 1
try 1
if 1
we 1
cannot 1
remember 1
a 1
prayer 1
Isn 1
t 1
there 1
a 1
verse 1
somewhere 1
Though 1
your 1
sins 1
be 1
as 1
scarlet 1
yet 1
I 1
will 1
make 1
them 1
as 1
white 1
as 1
snow 1
Those 1
words 1
mean 1
nothing 1
to 1
me 1
now 1
Hush 1
Don 1
t 1
say 1
that 1
You 1
have 1
done 1
enough 1
evil 1
in 1
your 1
life 1
My 1
God 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
accursed 1
thing 1
leering 1
at 1
us 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
glanced 1
at 1
the 1
picture 1
and 1
suddenly 1
an 1
uncontrollable 1
feeling 1
of 1
hatred 1
for 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
came 1
over 1
him 1
as 1
though 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
suggested 1
to 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
image 1
on 1
the 1
canvas 1
whispered 1
into 1
his 1
ear 1
by 1
those 1
grinning 1
lips 1
The 1
mad 1
passions 1
of 1
a 1
hunted 1
animal 1
stirred 1
within 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
loathed 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
seated 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
more 1
than 1
in 1
his 1
whole 1
life 1
he 1
had 1
ever 1
loathed 1
anything 1
He 1
glanced 1
wildly 1
around 1
Something 1
glimmered 1
on 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
painted 1
chest 1
that 1
faced 1
him 1
His 1
eye 1
fell 1
on 1
it 1
He 1
knew 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
knife 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
brought 1
up 1
some 1
days 1
before 1
to 1
cut 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
cord 1
and 1
had 1
forgotten 1
to 1
take 1
away 1
with 1
him 1
He 1
moved 1
slowly 1
towards 1
it 1
passing 1
Hallward 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
so 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
got 1
behind 1
him 1
he 1
seized 1
it 1
and 1
turned 1
round 1
Hallward 1
stirred 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
rise 1
He 1
rushed 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
dug 1
the 1
knife 1
into 1
the 1
great 1
vein 1
that 1
is 1
behind 1
the 1
ear 1
crushing 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
head 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
stabbing 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
stifled 1
groan 1
and 1
the 1
horrible 1
sound 1
of 1
some 1
one 1
choking 1
with 1
blood 1
Three 1
times 1
the 1
outstretched 1
arms 1
shot 1
up 1
convulsively 1
waving 1
grotesque 1
stiff 1
fingered 1
hands 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
He 1
stabbed 1
him 1
twice 1
more 1
but 1
the 1
man 1
did 1
not 1
move 1
Something 1
began 1
to 1
trickle 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
He 1
waited 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
still 1
pressing 1
the 1
head 1
down 1
Then 1
he 1
threw 1
the 1
knife 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
listened 1
He 1
could 1
hear 1
nothing 1
but 1
the 1
drip 2
on 1
the 1
threadbare 1
carpet 1
He 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
landing 1
The 1
house 1
was 1
absolutely 1
quiet 1
No 1
one 1
was 1
about 1
For 1
a 1
few 1
seconds 1
he 1
stood 1
bending 1
over 1
the 1
balustrade 1
and 1
peering 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
black 1
seething 1
well 1
of 1
darkness 1
Then 1
he 1
took 1
out 1
the 1
key 1
and 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
room 1
locking 1
himself 1
in 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
so 1
The 1
thing 1
was 1
still 1
seated 1
in 1
the 1
chair 1
straining 1
over 1
the 1
table 1
with 1
bowed 1
head 1
and 1
humped 1
back 1
and 1
long 1
fantastic 1
arms 1
Had 1
it 1
not 1
been 1
for 1
the 1
red 1
jagged 1
tear 1
in 1
the 1
neck 1
and 1
the 1
clotted 1
black 1
pool 1
that 1
was 1
slowly 1
widening 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
one 1
would 1
have 1
said 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
simply 1
asleep 1
How 1
quickly 1
it 1
had 1
all 1
been 1
done 1
He 1
felt 1
strangely 1
calm 1
and 1
walking 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
opened 1
it 1
and 1
stepped 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
balcony 1
The 1
wind 1
had 1
blown 1
the 1
fog 1
away 1
and 1
the 1
sky 1
was 1
like 1
a 1
monstrous 1
peacock 1
s 1
tail 1
starred 1
with 1
myriads 1
of 1
golden 1
eyes 1
He 1
looked 1
down 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
policeman 1
going 1
his 1
rounds 1
and 1
flashing 1
the 1
long 1
beam 1
of 1
his 1
lantern 1
on 1
the 1
doors 1
of 1
the 1
silent 1
houses 1
The 1
crimson 1
spot 1
of 1
a 1
prowling 1
hansom 1
gleamed 1
at 1
the 1
corner 1
and 1
then 1
vanished 1
A 1
woman 1
in 1
a 1
fluttering 1
shawl 1
was 1
creeping 1
slowly 1
by 1
the 1
railings 1
staggering 1
as 1
she 1
went 1
Now 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
stopped 1
and 1
peered 1
back 1
Once 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
sing 1
in 1
a 1
hoarse 1
voice 1
The 1
policeman 1
strolled 1
over 1
and 1
said 1
something 1
to 1
her 1
She 1
stumbled 1
away 1
laughing 1
A 1
bitter 1
blast 1
swept 1
across 1
the 1
square 1
The 1
gas 1
lamps 1
flickered 1
and 1
became 1
blue 1
and 1
the 1
leafless 1
trees 1
shook 1
their 1
black 1
iron 1
branches 1
to 1
and 1
fro 1
He 1
shivered 1
and 1
went 1
back 1
closing 1
the 1
window 1
behind 1
him 1
Having 1
reached 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
turned 1
the 1
key 1
and 1
opened 1
it 1
He 1
did 1
not 1
even 1
glance 1
at 1
the 1
murdered 1
man 1
He 1
felt 1
that 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
realize 1
the 1
situation 1
The 1
friend 1
who 1
had 1
painted 1
the 1
fatal 1
portrait 1
to 1
which 1
all 1
his 1
misery 1
had 1
been 1
due 1
had 1
gone 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
That 1
was 1
enough 1
Then 1
he 1
remembered 1
the 1
lamp 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
rather 1
curious 1
one 1
of 1
Moorish 1
workmanship 1
made 1
of 1
dull 1
silver 1
inlaid 1
with 1
arabesques 1
of 1
burnished 1
steel 1
and 1
studded 1
with 1
coarse 1
turquoises 1
Perhaps 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
missed 1
by 1
his 1
servant 1
and 1
questions 1
would 1
be 1
asked 1
He 1
hesitated 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
then 1
he 1
turned 1
back 1
and 1
took 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
He 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
seeing 1
the 1
dead 1
thing 1
How 1
still 1
it 1
was 1
How 1
horribly 1
white 1
the 1
long 1
hands 1
looked 1
It 1
was 1
like 1
a 1
dreadful 1
wax 1
image 1
Having 1
locked 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
him 1
he 1
crept 1
quietly 1
downstairs 1
The 1
woodwork 1
creaked 1
and 1
seemed 1
to 1
cry 1
out 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
pain 1
He 1
stopped 1
several 1
times 1
and 1
waited 1
No 1
everything 1
was 1
still 1
It 1
was 1
merely 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
footsteps 1
When 1
he 1
reached 1
the 1
library 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
bag 1
and 1
coat 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
They 1
must 1
be 1
hidden 1
away 1
somewhere 1
He 1
unlocked 1
a 1
secret 1
press 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
wainscoting 1
a 1
press 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
kept 1
his 1
own 1
curious 1
disguises 1
and 1
put 1
them 1
into 1
it 1
He 1
could 1
easily 1
burn 1
them 1
afterwards 1
Then 1
he 1
pulled 1
out 1
his 1
watch 1
It 1
was 1
twenty 1
minutes 1
to 1
two 1
He 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
Every 1
year 1
every 1
month 1
almost 1
men 1
were 1
strangled 1
in 1
England 1
for 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
There 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
madness 1
of 1
murder 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
Some 1
red 1
star 1
had 1
come 1
too 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
earth 1
And 1
yet 1
what 1
evidence 1
was 1
there 1
against 1
him 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
had 1
left 1
the 1
house 1
at 1
eleven 1
No 1
one 1
had 1
seen 1
him 1
come 1
in 1
again 1
Most 1
of 1
the 1
servants 1
were 1
at 1
Selby 1
Royal 1
His 1
valet 1
had 1
gone 1
to 1
bed 1
Paris 1
Yes 1
It 1
was 1
to 1
Paris 1
that 1
Basil 1
had 1
gone 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
midnight 1
train 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
intended 1
With 1
his 1
curious 1
reserved 1
habits 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
months 1
before 1
any 1
suspicions 1
would 1
be 1
roused 1
Months 1
Everything 1
could 1
be 1
destroyed 1
long 1
before 1
then 1
A 1
sudden 1
thought 1
struck 1
him 1
He 1
put 1
on 1
his 1
fur 1
coat 1
and 1
hat 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
hall 1
There 1
he 1
paused 1
hearing 1
the 1
slow 1
heavy 1
tread 1
of 1
the 1
policeman 1
on 1
the 1
pavement 1
outside 1
and 1
seeing 1
the 1
flash 1
of 1
the 1
bull 1
s 1
eye 1
reflected 1
in 1
the 1
window 1
He 1
waited 1
and 1
held 1
his 1
breath 1
After 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
he 1
drew 1
back 1
the 1
latch 1
and 1
slipped 1
out 1
shutting 1
the 1
door 1
very 1
gently 1
behind 1
him 1
Then 1
he 1
began 1
ringing 1
the 1
bell 1
In 1
about 1
five 1
minutes 1
his 1
valet 1
appeared 1
half 1
dressed 1
and 1
looking 1
very 1
drowsy 1
I 1
am 1
sorry 1
to 1
have 1
had 1
to 1
wake 1
you 1
up 1
Francis 1
he 1
said 1
stepping 1
in 1
but 1
I 1
had 1
forgotten 1
my 1
latch 1
key 1
What 1
time 1
is 1
it 1
Ten 1
minutes 1
past 1
two 1
sir 1
answered 1
the 1
man 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
clock 1
and 1
blinking 1
Ten 1
minutes 1
past 1
two 1
How 1
horribly 1
late 1
You 1
must 1
wake 1
me 1
at 1
nine 1
to 1
morrow 1
I 1
have 1
some 1
work 1
to 1
do 1
All 1
right 1
sir 1
Did 1
any 1
one 1
call 1
this 1
evening 1
Mr 1
Hallward 1
sir 1
He 1
stayed 1
here 1
till 1
eleven 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
away 1
to 1
catch 1
his 1
train 1
Oh 1
I 1
am 1
sorry 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
see 1
him 1
Did 1
he 1
leave 1
any 1
message 1
No 1
sir 1
except 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
write 1
to 1
you 1
from 1
Paris 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
find 1
you 1
at 1
the 1
club 1
That 1
will 1
do 1
Francis 1
Don 1
t 1
forget 1
to 1
call 1
me 1
at 1
nine 1
to 1
morrow 1
No 1
sir 1
The 1
man 1
shambled 1
down 1
the 1
passage 1
in 1
his 1
slippers 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
threw 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
coat 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
passed 1
into 1
the 1
library 1
For 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
he 1
walked 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
biting 1
his 1
lip 1
and 1
thinking 1
Then 1
he 1
took 1
down 1
the 1
Blue 1
Book 1
from 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
shelves 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
turn 1
over 1
the 1
leaves 1
Alan 1
Campbell 1
Hertford 1
Street 1
Mayfair 1
Yes 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
man 1
he 1
wanted 1
CHAPTER 1
At 1
nine 1
o 1
clock 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
his 1
servant 1
came 1
in 1
with 1
a 1
cup 1
of 1
chocolate 1
on 1
a 1
tray 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
shutters 1
Dorian 1
was 1
sleeping 1
quite 1
peacefully 1
lying 1
on 1
his 1
right 1
side 1
with 1
one 1
hand 1
underneath 1
his 1
cheek 1
He 1
looked 1
like 1
a 1
boy 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
tired 1
out 1
with 1
play 1
or 1
study 1
The 1
man 1
had 1
to 1
touch 1
him 1
twice 1
on 1
the 1
shoulder 1
before 1
he 1
woke 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
opened 1
his 1
eyes 1
a 1
faint 1
smile 1
passed 1
across 1
his 1
lips 1
as 1
though 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
lost 1
in 1
some 1
delightful 1
dream 1
Yet 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
dreamed 1
at 1
all 1
His 1
night 1
had 1
been 1
untroubled 1
by 1
any 1
images 1
of 1
pleasure 1
or 1
of 1
pain 1
But 1
youth 1
smiles 1
without 1
any 1
reason 1
It 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
its 1
chiefest 1
charms 1
He 1
turned 1
round 1
and 1
leaning 1
upon 1
his 1
elbow 1
began 1
to 1
sip 1
his 1
chocolate 1
The 1
mellow 1
November 1
sun 1
came 1
streaming 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
The 1
sky 1
was 1
bright 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
genial 1
warmth 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
It 1
was 1
almost 1
like 1
a 1
morning 1
in 1
May 1
Gradually 1
the 1
events 1
of 1
the 1
preceding 1
night 1
crept 1
with 1
silent 1
blood 1
stained 1
feet 1
into 1
his 1
brain 1
and 1
reconstructed 1
themselves 1
there 1
with 1
terrible 1
distinctness 1
He 1
winced 1
at 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
suffered 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
the 1
same 1
curious 1
feeling 1
of 1
loathing 1
for 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
that 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
kill 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
sat 1
in 1
the 1
chair 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
grew 1
cold 1
with 1
passion 1
The 1
dead 1
man 1
was 1
still 1
sitting 1
there 1
too 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
sunlight 1
now 1
How 1
horrible 1
that 1
was 1
Such 1
hideous 1
things 1
were 1
for 1
the 1
darkness 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
day 1
He 1
felt 1
that 1
if 1
he 1
brooded 1
on 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
through 1
he 1
would 1
sicken 1
or 1
grow 1
mad 1
There 1
were 1
sins 1
whose 1
fascination 1
was 1
more 1
in 1
the 1
memory 1
than 1
in 1
the 1
doing 1
of 1
them 1
strange 1
triumphs 1
that 1
gratified 1
the 1
pride 1
more 1
than 1
the 1
passions 1
and 1
gave 1
to 1
the 1
intellect 1
a 1
quickened 1
sense 1
of 1
joy 1
greater 1
than 1
any 1
joy 1
they 1
brought 1
or 1
could 1
ever 1
bring 1
to 1
the 1
senses 1
But 1
this 1
was 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
thing 1
to 1
be 1
driven 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
mind 1
to 1
be 1
drugged 1
with 1
poppies 1
to 1
be 1
strangled 1
lest 1
it 1
might 1
strangle 1
one 1
itself 1
When 1
the 1
half 1
hour 1
struck 1
he 1
passed 1
his 1
hand 1
across 1
his 1
forehead 1
and 1
then 1
got 1
up 1
hastily 1
and 1
dressed 1
himself 1
with 1
even 1
more 1
than 1
his 1
usual 1
care 1
giving 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
of 1
attention 1
to 1
the 1
choice 1
of 1
his 1
necktie 1
and 1
scarf 1
pin 1
and 1
changing 1
his 1
rings 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
He 1
spent 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
also 1
over 1
breakfast 1
tasting 1
the 1
various 1
dishes 1
talking 1
to 1
his 1
valet 1
about 1
some 1
new 1
liveries 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
thinking 1
of 1
getting 1
made 1
for 1
the 1
servants 1
at 1
Selby 1
and 1
going 1
through 1
his 1
correspondence 1
At 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
letters 1
he 1
smiled 1
Three 1
of 1
them 1
bored 1
him 1
One 1
he 1
read 1
several 1
times 1
over 1
and 1
then 1
tore 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
slight 1
look 1
of 1
annoyance 1
in 1
his 1
face 1
That 1
awful 1
thing 1
a 1
woman 1
s 1
memory 1
as 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
had 1
once 1
said 1
After 1
he 1
had 1
drunk 1
his 1
cup 1
of 1
black 1
coffee 1
he 1
wiped 1
his 1
lips 1
slowly 1
with 1
a 1
napkin 1
motioned 1
to 1
his 1
servant 1
to 1
wait 1
and 1
going 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
wrote 1
two 1
letters 1
One 1
he 1
put 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
the 1
other 1
he 1
handed 1
to 1
the 1
valet 1
Take 1
this 1
round 1
to 1
Hertford 1
Street 1
Francis 1
and 1
if 1
Mr 1
Campbell 1
is 1
out 1
of 1
town 1
get 1
his 1
address 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
alone 1
he 1
lit 1
a 1
cigarette 1
and 1
began 1
sketching 1
upon 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
paper 1
drawing 1
first 1
flowers 1
and 1
bits 1
of 1
architecture 1
and 1
then 1
human 1
faces 1
Suddenly 1
he 1
remarked 1
that 1
every 1
face 1
that 1
he 1
drew 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
fantastic 1
likeness 1
to 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
He 1
frowned 1
and 1
getting 1
up 1
went 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
book 1
case 1
and 1
took 1
out 1
a 1
volume 1
at 1
hazard 1
He 1
was 1
determined 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
think 1
about 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
until 1
it 1
became 1
absolutely 1
necessary 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
do 1
so 1
When 1
he 1
had 1
stretched 1
himself 1
on 1
the 1
sofa 1
he 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
title 1
page 1
of 1
the 1
book 1
It 1
was 1
Gautier 1
s 1
Emaux 1
et 1
Camees 1
Charpentier 1
s 1
Japanese 1
paper 1
edition 1
with 1
the 1
Jacquemart 1
etching 1
The 1
binding 1
was 1
of 1
citron 1
green 1
leather 1
with 1
a 1
design 1
of 1
gilt 1
trellis 1
work 1
and 1
dotted 1
pomegranates 1
It 1
had 1
been 1
given 1
to 1
him 1
by 1
Adrian 1
Singleton 1
As 1
he 1
turned 1
over 1
the 1
pages 1
his 1
eye 1
fell 1
on 1
the 1
poem 1
about 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
Lacenaire 1
the 1
cold 1
yellow 1
hand 1
du 1
supplice 1
encore 1
mal 1
lavee 1
with 1
its 1
downy 1
red 1
hairs 1
and 1
its 1
doigts 1
de 1
faune 1
He 1
glanced 1
at 1
his 1
own 1
white 1
taper 1
fingers 1
shuddering 1
slightly 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
himself 1
and 1
passed 1
on 1
till 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
those 1
lovely 1
stanzas 1
upon 1
Venice 1
Sur 1

How 1
exquisite 1
they 1
were 1
As 1
one 1
read 1
them 1
one 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
floating 1
down 1
the 1
green 1
water 1
ways 1
of 1
the 1
pink 1
and 1
pearl 1
city 1
seated 1
in 1
a 1
black 1
gondola 1
with 1
silver 1
prow 1
and 1
trailing 1
curtains 1
The 1
mere 1
lines 1
looked 1
to 1
him 1
like 1
those 1
straight 1
lines 1
of 1
turquoise 1
blue 1
that 1
follow 1
one 1
as 1
one 1
pushes 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
Lido 1
The 1
sudden 1
flashes 1
of 1
colour 1
reminded 1
him 1
of 1
the 1
gleam 1
of 1
the 1
opal 1
and 1
iris 1
throated 1
birds 1
that 1
flutter 1
round 1
the 1
tall 1
honeycombed 1
Campanile 1
or 1
stalk 1
with 1
such 1
stately 1
grace 1
through 1
the 1
dim 1
dust 1
stained 1
arcades 1
Leaning 1
back 1
with 1
half 1
closed 1
eyes 1
he 1
kept 1
saying 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
to 1
himself 1
Devant 1

The 1
whole 1
of 1
Venice 1
was 1
in 1
those 1
two 1
lines 1
He 1
remembered 1
the 1
autumn 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
passed 1
there 1
and 1
a 1
wonderful 1
love 1
that 1
had 1
stirred 1
him 1
to 1
mad 1
delightful 1
follies 1
There 1
was 1
romance 1
in 1
every 1
place 1
But 1
Venice 1
like 1
Oxford 1
had 1
kept 1
the 1
background 1
for 1
romance 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
true 1
romantic 1
background 1
was 1
everything 1
or 1
almost 1
everything 1
Basil 1
had 1
been 1
with 1
him 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
had 1
gone 1
wild 1
over 1
Tintoret 1
Poor 1
Basil 1
What 1
a 1
horrible 1
way 1
for 1
a 1
man 1
to 1
die 1
He 1
sighed 1
and 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
volume 1
again 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
forget 1
He 1
read 1
of 1
the 1
swallows 1
that 1
fly 1
in 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
cafe 1
at 1
Smyrna 1
where 1
the 1
Hadjis 1
sit 1
counting 1
their 1
amber 1
beads 1
and 1
the 1
turbaned 1
merchants 1
smoke 1
their 1
long 1
tasselled 1
pipes 1
and 1
talk 1
gravely 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
he 1
read 1
of 1
the 1
Obelisk 1
in 1
the 1
Place 1
de 1
la 1
Concorde 1
that 1
weeps 1
tears 1
of 1
granite 1
in 1
its 1
lonely 1
sunless 1
exile 1
and 1
longs 1
to 1
be 1
back 1
by 1
the 1
hot 1
lotus 1
covered 1
Nile 1
where 1
there 1
are 1
Sphinxes 1
and 1
rose 1
red 1
ibises 1
and 1
white 1
vultures 1
with 1
gilded 1
claws 1
and 1
crocodiles 1
with 1
small 1
beryl 1
eyes 1
that 1
crawl 1
over 1
the 1
green 1
steaming 1
mud 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
brood 1
over 1
those 1
verses 1
which 1
drawing 1
music 1
from 1
kiss 1
stained 1
marble 1
tell 1
of 1
that 1
curious 1
statue 1
that 1
Gautier 1
compares 1
to 1
a 1
contralto 1
voice 1
the 1
monstre 1
charmant 1
that 1
couches 1
in 1
the 1
porphyry 1
room 1
of 1
the 1
Louvre 1
But 1
after 1
a 1
time 1
the 1
book 1
fell 1
from 1
his 1
hand 1
He 1
grew 1
nervous 1
and 1
a 1
horrible 1
fit 1
of 1
terror 1
came 1
over 1
him 1
What 1
if 1
Alan 1
Campbell 1
should 1
be 1
out 1
of 1
England 1
Days 1
would 1
elapse 1
before 1
he 1
could 1
come 1
back 1
Perhaps 1
he 1
might 1
refuse 1
to 1
come 1
What 1
could 1
he 1
do 1
then 1
Every 1
moment 1
was 1
of 1
vital 1
importance 1
They 1
had 1
been 1
great 1
friends 1
once 1
five 1
years 1
before 1
almost 1
inseparable 1
indeed 1
Then 1
the 1
intimacy 1
had 1
come 1
suddenly 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
When 1
they 1
met 1
in 1
society 1
now 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
who 1
smiled 1
Alan 1
Campbell 1
never 1
did 1
He 1
was 1
an 1
extremely 1
clever 1
young 1
man 1
though 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
real 1
appreciation 1
of 1
the 1
visible 1
arts 1
and 1
whatever 1
little 1
sense 1
of 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
poetry 1
he 1
possessed 1
he 1
had 1
gained 1
entirely 1
from 1
Dorian 1
His 1
dominant 1
intellectual 1
passion 1
was 1
for 1
science 1
At 1
Cambridge 1
he 1
had 1
spent 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
his 1
time 1
working 1
in 1
the 1
laboratory 1
and 1
had 1
taken 1
a 1
good 1
class 1
in 1
the 1
Natural 1
Science 1
Tripos 1
of 1
his 1
year 1
Indeed 1
he 1
was 1
still 1
devoted 1
to 1
the 1
study 1
of 1
chemistry 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
laboratory 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
shut 1
himself 1
up 1
all 1
day 1
long 1
greatly 1
to 1
the 1
annoyance 1
of 1
his 1
mother 1
who 1
had 1
set 1
her 1
heart 1
on 1
his 1
standing 1
for 1
Parliament 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
vague 1
idea 1
that 1
a 1
chemist 1
was 1
a 1
person 1
who 1
made 1
up 1
prescriptions 1
He 1
was 1
an 1
excellent 1
musician 1
however 1
as 1
well 1
and 1
played 1
both 1
the 1
violin 1
and 1
the 1
piano 1
better 1
than 1
most 1
amateurs 1
In 1
fact 1
it 1
was 1
music 1
that 1
had 1
first 1
brought 1
him 1
and 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
together 1
music 1
and 1
that 1
indefinable 1
attraction 1
that 1
Dorian 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
exercise 1
whenever 1
he 1
wished 1
and 1
indeed 1
exercised 1
often 1
without 1
being 1
conscious 1
of 1
it 1
They 1
had 1
met 1
at 1
Lady 1
Berkshire 1
s 1
the 1
night 1
that 1
Rubinstein 1
played 1
there 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
always 1
seen 1
together 1
at 1
the 1
opera 1
and 1
wherever 1
good 1
music 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
For 1
eighteen 1
months 1
their 1
intimacy 1
lasted 1
Campbell 1
was 1
always 1
either 1
at 1
Selby 1
Royal 1
or 1
in 1
Grosvenor 1
Square 1
To 1
him 1
as 1
to 1
many 1
others 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
was 1
the 1
type 1
of 1
everything 1
that 1
is 1
wonderful 1
and 1
fascinating 1
in 1
life 1
Whether 1
or 1
not 1
a 1
quarrel 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
between 1
them 1
no 1
one 1
ever 1
knew 1
But 1
suddenly 1
people 1
remarked 1
that 1
they 1
scarcely 1
spoke 1
when 1
they 1
met 1
and 1
that 1
Campbell 1
seemed 1
always 1
to 1
go 1
away 1
early 1
from 1
any 1
party 1
at 1
which 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
was 1
present 1
He 1
had 1
changed 1
too 1
was 1
strangely 1
melancholy 1
at 1
times 1
appeared 1
almost 1
to 1
dislike 1
hearing 1
music 1
and 1
would 1
never 1
himself 1
play 1
giving 1
as 1
his 1
excuse 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
called 1
upon 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
absorbed 1
in 1
science 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
time 1
left 1
in 1
which 1
to 1
practise 1
And 1
this 1
was 1
certainly 1
true 1
Every 1
day 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
become 1
more 1
interested 1
in 1
biology 1
and 1
his 1
name 1
appeared 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
in 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
scientific 1
reviews 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
certain 1
curious 1
experiments 1
This 1
was 1
the 1
man 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
was 1
waiting 1
for 1
Every 1
second 1
he 1
kept 1
glancing 1
at 1
the 1
clock 1
As 1
the 1
minutes 1
went 1
by 1
he 1
became 1
horribly 1
agitated 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
pace 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
looking 1
like 1
a 1
beautiful 1
caged 1
thing 1
He 1
took 1
long 1
stealthy 1
strides 1
His 1
hands 1
were 1
curiously 1
cold 1
The 1
suspense 1
became 1
unbearable 1
Time 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
crawling 1
with 1
feet 1
of 1
lead 1
while 1
he 1
by 1
monstrous 1
winds 1
was 1
being 1
swept 1
towards 1
the 1
jagged 1
edge 1
of 1
some 1
black 1
cleft 1
of 1
precipice 1
He 1
knew 1
what 1
was 1
waiting 1
for 1
him 1
there 1
saw 1
it 1
indeed 1
and 1
shuddering 1
crushed 1
with 1
dank 1
hands 1
his 1
burning 1
lids 1
as 1
though 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
robbed 1
the 1
very 1
brain 1
of 1
sight 1
and 1
driven 1
the 1
eyeballs 1
back 1
into 1
their 1
cave 1
It 1
was 1
useless 1
The 1
brain 1
had 1
its 1
own 1
food 1
on 1
which 1
it 1
battened 1
and 1
the 1
imagination 1
made 1
grotesque 1
by 1
terror 1
twisted 1
and 1
distorted 1
as 1
a 1
living 1
thing 1
by 1
pain 1
danced 1
like 1
some 1
foul 1
puppet 1
on 1
a 1
stand 1
and 1
grinned 1
through 1
moving 1
masks 1
Then 1
suddenly 1
time 1
stopped 1
for 1
him 1
Yes 1
that 1
blind 1
slow 1
breathing 1
thing 1
crawled 1
no 1
more 1
and 1
horrible 1
thoughts 1
time 1
being 1
dead 1
raced 1
nimbly 1
on 1
in 1
front 1
and 1
dragged 1
a 1
hideous 1
future 1
from 1
its 1
grave 1
and 1
showed 1
it 1
to 1
him 1
He 1
stared 1
at 1
it 1
Its 1
very 1
horror 1
made 1
him 1
stone 1
At 1
last 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
his 1
servant 1
entered 1
He 1
turned 1
glazed 1
eyes 1
upon 1
him 1
Mr 1
Campbell 1
sir 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
A 1
sigh 1
of 1
relief 1
broke 1
from 1
his 1
parched 1
lips 1
and 1
the 1
colour 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
cheeks 1
Ask 1
him 1
to 1
come 1
in 1
at 1
once 1
Francis 1
He 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
himself 1
again 1
His 1
mood 1
of 1
cowardice 1
had 1
passed 1
away 1
The 1
man 1
bowed 1
and 1
retired 1
In 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
Alan 1
Campbell 1
walked 1
in 1
looking 1
very 1
stern 1
and 1
rather 1
pale 1
his 1
pallor 1
being 1
intensified 1
by 1
his 1
coal 1
black 1
hair 1
and 1
dark 1
eyebrows 1
Alan 1
This 1
is 1
kind 1
of 1
you 1
I 1
thank 1
you 1
for 1
coming 1
I 1
had 1
intended 1
never 1
to 1
enter 1
your 1
house 1
again 1
Gray 1
But 1
you 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
death 1
His 1
voice 1
was 1
hard 1
and 1
cold 1
He 1
spoke 1
with 1
slow 1
deliberation 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
contempt 1
in 1
the 1
steady 1
searching 1
gaze 1
that 1
he 1
turned 1
on 1
Dorian 1
He 1
kept 1
his 1
hands 1
in 1
the 1
pockets 1
of 1
his 1
Astrakhan 1
coat 1
and 1
seemed 1
not 1
to 1
have 1
noticed 1
the 1
gesture 1
with 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
greeted 1
Yes 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
death 1
Alan 1
and 1
to 1
more 1
than 1
one 1
person 1
Sit 1
down 1
Campbell 1
took 1
a 1
chair 1
by 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
Dorian 1
sat 1
opposite 1
to 1
him 1
The 1
two 1
men 1
s 1
eyes 1
met 1
In 1
Dorian 1
s 1
there 1
was 1
infinite 1
pity 1
He 1
knew 1
that 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
was 1
dreadful 1
After 1
a 1
strained 1
moment 1
of 1
silence 1
he 1
leaned 1
across 1
and 1
said 1
very 1
quietly 1
but 1
watching 1
the 1
effect 1
of 1
each 1
word 1
upon 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
him 1
he 1
had 1
sent 1
for 1
Alan 1
in 1
a 1
locked 1
room 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
this 1
house 1
a 1
room 1
to 1
which 1
nobody 1
but 1
myself 1
has 1
access 1
a 1
dead 1
man 1
is 1
seated 1
at 1
a 1
table 1
He 1
has 1
been 1
dead 1
ten 1
hours 1
now 1
Don 1
t 1
stir 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
look 1
at 1
me 1
like 1
that 1
Who 1
the 1
man 1
is 1
why 1
he 1
died 1
how 1
he 1
died 1
are 1
matters 1
that 1
do 1
not 1
concern 1
you 1
What 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
do 1
is 1
this 1
Stop 1
Gray 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
know 1
anything 1
further 1
Whether 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
told 1
me 1
is 1
true 1
or 1
not 1
true 1
doesn 1
t 1
concern 1
me 1
I 1
entirely 1
decline 1
to 1
be 1
mixed 1
up 1
in 1
your 1
life 1
Keep 1
your 1
horrible 1
secrets 1
to 1
yourself 1
They 1
don 1
t 1
interest 1
me 1
any 1
more 1
Alan 1
they 1
will 1
have 1
to 1
interest 1
you 1
This 1
one 1
will 1
have 1
to 1
interest 1
you 1
I 1
am 1
awfully 1
sorry 1
for 1
you 1
Alan 1
But 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
help 1
myself 1
You 1
are 1
the 1
one 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
able 1
to 1
save 1
me 1
I 1
am 1
forced 1
to 1
bring 1
you 1
into 1
the 1
matter 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
option 1
Alan 1
you 1
are 1
scientific 1
You 1
know 1
about 1
chemistry 1
and 1
things 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
You 1
have 1
made 1
experiments 1
What 1
you 1
have 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
is 1
to 1
destroy 1
the 1
thing 1
that 1
is 1
upstairs 1
to 1
destroy 1
it 1
so 1
that 1
not 1
a 1
vestige 1
of 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
left 1
Nobody 1
saw 1
this 1
person 1
come 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
Indeed 1
at 1
the 1
present 1
moment 1
he 1
is 1
supposed 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
Paris 1
He 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
missed 1
for 1
months 1
When 1
he 1
is 1
missed 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
no 1
trace 1
of 1
him 1
found 1
here 1
You 1
Alan 1
you 1
must 1
change 1
him 1
and 1
everything 1
that 1
belongs 1
to 1
him 1
into 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
ashes 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
scatter 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
You 1
are 1
mad 1
Dorian 1
Ah 1
I 1
was 1
waiting 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
call 1
me 1
Dorian 1
You 1
are 1
mad 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
mad 1
to 1
imagine 1
that 1
I 1
would 1
raise 1
a 1
finger 1
to 1
help 1
you 1
mad 1
to 1
make 1
this 1
monstrous 1
confession 1
I 1
will 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
this 1
matter 1
whatever 1
it 1
is 1
Do 1
you 1
think 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
peril 1
my 1
reputation 1
for 1
you 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
to 1
me 1
what 1
devil 1
s 1
work 1
you 1
are 1
up 1
to 1
It 1
was 1
suicide 1
Alan 1
I 1
am 1
glad 1
of 1
that 1
But 1
who 1
drove 1
him 1
to 1
it 1
You 1
I 1
should 1
fancy 1
Do 1
you 1
still 1
refuse 1
to 1
do 1
this 1
for 1
me 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
refuse 1
I 1
will 1
have 1
absolutely 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
what 1
shame 1
comes 1
on 1
you 1
You 1
deserve 1
it 1
all 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
sorry 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
disgraced 1
publicly 1
disgraced 1
How 1
dare 1
you 1
ask 1
me 1
of 1
all 1
men 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
mix 1
myself 1
up 1
in 1
this 1
horror 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
thought 1
you 1
knew 1
more 1
about 1
people 1
s 1
characters 1
Your 1
friend 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Wotton 1
can 1
t 1
have 1
taught 1
you 1
much 1
about 1
psychology 1
whatever 1
else 1
he 1
has 1
taught 1
you 1
Nothing 1
will 1
induce 1
me 1
to 1
stir 1
a 1
step 1
to 1
help 1
you 1
You 1
have 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
wrong 1
man 1
Go 1
to 1
some 1
of 1
your 1
friends 1
Don 1
t 1
come 1
to 1
me 1
Alan 1
it 1
was 1
murder 1
I 1
killed 1
him 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
made 1
me 1
suffer 1
Whatever 1
my 1
life 1
is 1
he 1
had 1
more 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
the 1
making 1
or 1
the 1
marring 1
of 1
it 1
than 1
poor 1
Harry 1
has 1
had 1
He 1
may 1
not 1
have 1
intended 1
it 1
the 1
result 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
Murder 1
Good 1
God 1
Dorian 1
is 1
that 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
come 1
to 1
I 1
shall 1
not 1
inform 1
upon 1
you 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
my 1
business 1
Besides 1
without 1
my 1
stirring 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
you 1
are 1
certain 1
to 1
be 1
arrested 1
Nobody 1
ever 1
commits 1
a 1
crime 1
without 1
doing 1
something 1
stupid 1
But 1
I 1
will 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
You 1
must 1
have 1
something 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
Wait 1
wait 1
a 1
moment 1
listen 1
to 1
me 1
Only 1
listen 1
Alan 1
All 1
I 1
ask 1
of 1
you 1
is 1
to 1
perform 1
a 1
certain 1
scientific 1
experiment 1
You 1
go 1
to 1
hospitals 1
and 1
dead 1
houses 1
and 1
the 1
horrors 1
that 1
you 1
do 1
there 1
don 1
t 1
affect 1
you 1
If 1
in 1
some 1
hideous 1
dissecting 1
room 1
or 1
fetid 1
laboratory 1
you 1
found 1
this 1
man 1
lying 1
on 1
a 1
leaden 1
table 1
with 1
red 1
gutters 1
scooped 1
out 1
in 1
it 1
for 1
the 1
blood 1
to 1
flow 1
through 1
you 1
would 1
simply 1
look 1
upon 1
him 1
as 1
an 1
admirable 1
subject 1
You 1
would 1
not 1
turn 1
a 1
hair 1
You 1
would 1
not 1
believe 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
doing 1
anything 1
wrong 1
On 1
the 1
contrary 1
you 1
would 1
probably 1
feel 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
benefiting 1
the 1
human 1
race 1
or 1
increasing 1
the 1
sum 1
of 1
knowledge 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
or 1
gratifying 1
intellectual 1
curiosity 1
or 1
something 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
What 1
I 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
is 1
merely 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
often 1
done 1
before 1
Indeed 1
to 1
destroy 1
a 1
body 1
must 1
be 1
far 1
less 1
horrible 1
than 1
what 1
you 1
are 1
accustomed 1
to 1
work 1
at 1
And 1
remember 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
piece 1
of 1
evidence 1
against 1
me 1
If 1
it 1
is 1
discovered 1
I 1
am 1
lost 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
sure 1
to 1
be 1
discovered 1
unless 1
you 1
help 1
me 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
desire 1
to 1
help 1
you 1
You 1
forget 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
simply 1
indifferent 1
to 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
It 1
has 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
me 1
Alan 1
I 1
entreat 1
you 1
Think 1
of 1
the 1
position 1
I 1
am 1
in 1
Just 1
before 1
you 1
came 1
I 1
almost 1
fainted 1
with 1
terror 1
You 1
may 1
know 1
terror 1
yourself 1
some 1
day 1
No 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
of 1
that 1
Look 1
at 1
the 1
matter 1
purely 1
from 1
the 1
scientific 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
inquire 1
where 1
the 1
dead 1
things 1
on 1
which 1
you 1
experiment 1
come 1
from 1
Don 1
t 1
inquire 1
now 1
I 1
have 1
told 1
you 1
too 1
much 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
But 1
I 1
beg 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
this 1
We 1
were 1
friends 1
once 1
Alan 1
Don 1
t 1
speak 1
about 1
those 1
days 1
Dorian 1
they 1
are 1
dead 1
The 1
dead 1
linger 1
sometimes 1
The 1
man 1
upstairs 1
will 1
not 1
go 1
away 1
He 1
is 1
sitting 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
with 1
bowed 1
head 1
and 1
outstretched 1
arms 1
Alan 2
If 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
come 1
to 1
my 1
assistance 1
I 1
am 1
ruined 1
Why 1
they 1
will 1
hang 1
me 1
Alan 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
understand 1
They 1
will 1
hang 1
me 1
for 1
what 1
I 1
have 1
done 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
good 1
in 1
prolonging 1
this 1
scene 1
I 1
absolutely 1
refuse 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
It 1
is 1
insane 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
ask 1
me 1
You 1
refuse 1
Yes 1
I 1
entreat 1
you 1
Alan 1
It 1
is 1
useless 1
The 1
same 1
look 1
of 1
pity 1
came 1
into 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
s 1
eyes 1
Then 1
he 1
stretched 1
out 1
his 1
hand 1
took 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
paper 1
and 1
wrote 1
something 1
on 1
it 1
He 1
read 1
it 1
over 1
twice 1
folded 1
it 1
carefully 1
and 1
pushed 1
it 1
across 1
the 1
table 1
Having 1
done 1
this 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
Campbell 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
in 1
surprise 1
and 1
then 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
paper 1
and 1
opened 1
it 1
As 1
he 1
read 1
it 1
his 1
face 1
became 1
ghastly 1
pale 1
and 1
he 1
fell 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
A 1
horrible 1
sense 1
of 1
sickness 1
came 1
over 1
him 1
He 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
his 1
heart 1
was 1
beating 1
itself 1
to 1
death 1
in 1
some 1
empty 1
hollow 1
After 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
minutes 1
of 1
terrible 1
silence 1
Dorian 1
turned 1
round 1
and 1
came 1
and 1
stood 1
behind 1
him 1
putting 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
his 1
shoulder 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
sorry 1
for 1
you 1
Alan 1
he 1
murmured 1
but 1
you 1
leave 1
me 1
no 1
alternative 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
letter 1
written 1
already 1
Here 1
it 1
is 1
You 1
see 1
the 1
address 1
If 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
help 1
me 1
I 1
must 1
send 1
it 1
If 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
help 1
me 1
I 1
will 1
send 1
it 1
You 1
know 1
what 1
the 1
result 1
will 1
be 1
But 1
you 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
help 1
me 1
It 1
is 1
impossible 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
refuse 1
now 1
I 1
tried 1
to 1
spare 1
you 1
You 1
will 1
do 1
me 1
the 1
justice 1
to 1
admit 1
that 1
You 1
were 1
stern 1
harsh 1
offensive 1
You 1
treated 1
me 1
as 1
no 1
man 1
has 1
ever 1
dared 1
to 1
treat 1
me 1
no 1
living 1
man 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
I 1
bore 1
it 1
all 1
Now 1
it 1
is 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
dictate 1
terms 1
Campbell 1
buried 1
his 1
face 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
a 1
shudder 1
passed 1
through 1
him 1
Yes 1
it 1
is 1
my 1
turn 1
to 1
dictate 1
terms 1
Alan 1
You 1
know 1
what 1
they 1
are 1
The 1
thing 1
is 1
quite 1
simple 1
Come 1
don 1
t 1
work 1
yourself 1
into 1
this 1
fever 1
The 1
thing 1
has 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
Face 1
it 1
and 1
do 1
it 1
A 1
groan 1
broke 1
from 1
Campbell 1
s 1
lips 1
and 1
he 1
shivered 1
all 1
over 1
The 1
ticking 1
of 1
the 1
clock 1
on 1
the 1
mantelpiece 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
dividing 1
time 1
into 1
separate 1
atoms 1
of 1
agony 1
each 1
of 1
which 1
was 1
too 1
terrible 1
to 1
be 1
borne 1
He 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
an 1
iron 1
ring 1
was 1
being 1
slowly 1
tightened 1
round 1
his 1
forehead 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
disgrace 1
with 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
threatened 1
had 1
already 1
come 1
upon 1
him 1
The 1
hand 1
upon 1
his 1
shoulder 1
weighed 1
like 1
a 1
hand 1
of 1
lead 1
It 1
was 1
intolerable 1
It 1
seemed 1
to 1
crush 1
him 1
Come 1
Alan 1
you 1
must 1
decide 1
at 1
once 1
I 1
cannot 1
do 1
it 1
he 1
said 1
mechanically 1
as 1
though 1
words 1
could 1
alter 1
things 1
You 1
must 1
You 1
have 1
no 1
choice 1
Don 1
t 1
delay 1
He 1
hesitated 1
a 1
moment 1
Is 1
there 1
a 1
fire 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
upstairs 1
Yes 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
gas 1
fire 1
with 1
asbestos 1
I 1
shall 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
get 1
some 1
things 1
from 1
the 1
laboratory 1
No 1
Alan 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
leave 1
the 1
house 1
Write 1
out 1
on 1
a 1
sheet 1
of 1
notepaper 1
what 1
you 1
want 1
and 1
my 1
servant 1
will 1
take 1
a 1
cab 1
and 1
bring 1
the 1
things 1
back 1
to 1
you 1
Campbell 1
scrawled 1
a 1
few 1
lines 1
blotted 1
them 1
and 1
addressed 1
an 1
envelope 1
to 1
his 1
assistant 1
Dorian 1
took 1
the 1
note 1
up 1
and 1
read 1
it 1
carefully 1
Then 1
he 1
rang 1
the 1
bell 1
and 1
gave 1
it 1
to 1
his 1
valet 1
with 1
orders 1
to 1
return 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
possible 1
and 1
to 1
bring 1
the 1
things 1
with 1
him 1
As 1
the 1
hall 1
door 1
shut 1
Campbell 1
started 1
nervously 1
and 1
having 1
got 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
chair 1
went 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
chimney 1
piece 1
He 1
was 1
shivering 1
with 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
ague 1
For 1
nearly 1
twenty 1
minutes 1
neither 1
of 1
the 1
men 1
spoke 1
A 1
fly 1
buzzed 1
noisily 1
about 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
the 1
ticking 1
of 1
the 1
clock 1
was 1
like 1
the 1
beat 1
of 1
a 1
hammer 1
As 1
the 1
chime 1
struck 1
one 1
Campbell 1
turned 1
round 1
and 1
looking 1
at 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
saw 1
that 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
filled 1
with 1
tears 1
There 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
the 1
purity 1
and 1
refinement 1
of 1
that 1
sad 1
face 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
enrage 1
him 1
You 1
are 1
infamous 1
absolutely 1
infamous 1
he 1
muttered 1
Hush 1
Alan 1
You 1
have 1
saved 1
my 1
life 1
said 1
Dorian 1
Your 1
life 1
Good 1
heavens 1
what 1
a 1
life 1
that 1
is 1
You 1
have 1
gone 1
from 1
corruption 1
to 1
corruption 1
and 1
now 1
you 1
have 1
culminated 1
in 1
crime 1
In 1
doing 1
what 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
what 1
you 1
force 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
of 1
your 1
life 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
thinking 1
Ah 1
Alan 1
murmured 1
Dorian 1
with 1
a 1
sigh 1
I 1
wish 1
you 1
had 1
a 1
thousandth 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
pity 1
for 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
for 1
you 1
He 1
turned 1
away 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
and 1
stood 1
looking 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
garden 1
Campbell 1
made 1
no 1
answer 1
After 1
about 1
ten 1
minutes 1
a 1
knock 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
the 1
servant 1
entered 1
carrying 1
a 1
large 1
mahogany 1
chest 1
of 1
chemicals 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
coil 1
of 1
steel 1
and 1
platinum 1
wire 1
and 1
two 1
rather 1
curiously 1
shaped 1
iron 1
clamps 1
Shall 1
I 1
leave 1
the 1
things 1
here 1
sir 1
he 1
asked 1
Campbell 1
Yes 1
said 1
Dorian 1
And 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
Francis 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
another 1
errand 1
for 1
you 1
What 1
is 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
at 1
Richmond 1
who 1
supplies 1
Selby 1
with 1
orchids 1
Harden 1
sir 1
Yes 1
Harden 1
You 1
must 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
Richmond 1
at 1
once 1
see 1
Harden 1
personally 1
and 1
tell 1
him 1
to 1
send 1
twice 1
as 1
many 1
orchids 1
as 1
I 1
ordered 1
and 1
to 1
have 1
as 1
few 1
white 1
ones 1
as 1
possible 1
In 1
fact 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
any 1
white 1
ones 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
lovely 1
day 1
Francis 1
and 1
Richmond 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
pretty 1
place 1
otherwise 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
bother 1
you 1
about 1
it 1
No 1
trouble 1
sir 1
At 1
what 1
time 1
shall 1
I 1
be 1
back 1
Dorian 1
looked 1
at 1
Campbell 1
How 1
long 1
will 1
your 1
experiment 1
take 1
Alan 1
he 1
said 1
in 1
a 1
calm 1
indifferent 1
voice 1
The 1
presence 1
of 1
a 1
third 1
person 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
seemed 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
extraordinary 1
courage 1
Campbell 1
frowned 1
and 1
bit 1
his 1
lip 1
It 1
will 1
take 1
about 1
five 1
hours 1
he 1
answered 1
It 1
will 1
be 1
time 1
enough 1
then 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
back 1
at 1
half 1
past 1
seven 1
Francis 1
Or 1
stay 1
just 1
leave 1
my 1
things 1
out 1
for 1
dressing 1
You 1
can 1
have 1
the 1
evening 1
to 1
yourself 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
dining 1
at 1
home 1
so 1
I 1
shall 1
not 1
want 1
you 1
Thank 1
you 1
sir 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
leaving 1
the 1
room 1
Now 1
Alan 1
there 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
moment 1
to 1
be 1
lost 1
How 1
heavy 1
this 1
chest 1
is 1
I 1
ll 1
take 1
it 1
for 1
you 1
You 1
bring 1
the 1
other 1
things 1
He 1
spoke 1
rapidly 1
and 1
in 1
an 1
authoritative 1
manner 1
Campbell 1
felt 1
dominated 1
by 1
him 1
They 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
together 1
When 1
they 1
reached 1
the 1
top 1
landing 1
Dorian 1
took 1
out 1
the 1
key 1
and 1
turned 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
Then 1
he 1
stopped 1
and 1
a 1
troubled 1
look 1
came 1
into 1
his 1
eyes 1
He 1
shuddered 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
I 1
can 1
go 1
in 1
Alan 1
he 1
murmured 1
It 1
is 1
nothing 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
require 1
you 1
said 1
Campbell 1
coldly 1
Dorian 1
half 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
As 1
he 1
did 1
so 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
his 1
portrait 1
leering 1
in 1
the 1
sunlight 1
On 1
the 1
floor 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
it 1
the 1
torn 1
curtain 1
was 1
lying 1
He 1
remembered 1
that 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
he 1
had 1
forgotten 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
in 1
his 1
life 1
to 1
hide 1
the 1
fatal 1
canvas 1
and 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
rush 1
forward 1
when 1
he 1
drew 1
back 1
with 1
a 1
shudder 1
What 1
was 1
that 1
loathsome 1
red 1
dew 1
that 1
gleamed 1
wet 1
and 1
glistening 1
on 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
hands 1
as 1
though 1
the 1
canvas 1
had 1
sweated 1
blood 1
How 1
horrible 1
it 1
was 1
more 1
horrible 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
than 1
the 1
silent 1
thing 1
that 1
he 1
knew 1
was 1
stretched 1
across 1
the 1
table 1
the 1
thing 1
whose 1
grotesque 1
misshapen 1
shadow 1
on 1
the 1
spotted 1
carpet 1
showed 1
him 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
not 1
stirred 1
but 1
was 1
still 1
there 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
it 1
He 1
heaved 1
a 1
deep 1
breath 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
a 1
little 1
wider 1
and 1
with 1
half 1
closed 1
eyes 1
and 1
averted 1
head 1
walked 1
quickly 1
in 1
determined 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
look 1
even 1
once 1
upon 1
the 1
dead 1
man 1
Then 1
stooping 1
down 1
and 1
taking 1
up 1
the 1
gold 1
and 1
purple 1
hanging 1
he 1
flung 1
it 1
right 1
over 1
the 1
picture 1
There 1
he 1
stopped 1
feeling 1
afraid 1
to 1
turn 1
round 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
themselves 1
on 1
the 1
intricacies 1
of 1
the 1
pattern 1
before 1
him 1
He 1
heard 1
Campbell 1
bringing 1
in 1
the 1
heavy 1
chest 1
and 1
the 1
irons 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
things 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
required 1
for 1
his 1
dreadful 1
work 1
He 1
began 1
to 1
wonder 1
if 1
he 1
and 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
had 1
ever 1
met 1
and 1
if 1
so 1
what 1
they 1
had 1
thought 1
of 1
each 1
other 1
Leave 1
me 1
now 1
said 1
a 1
stern 1
voice 1
behind 1
him 1
He 1
turned 1
and 1
hurried 1
out 1
just 1
conscious 1
that 1
the 1
dead 1
man 1
had 1
been 1
thrust 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
chair 1
and 1
that 1
Campbell 1
was 1
gazing 1
into 1
a 1
glistening 1
yellow 1
face 1
As 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
downstairs 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
key 1
being 1
turned 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
It 1
was 1
long 1
after 1
seven 1
when 1
Campbell 1
came 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
library 1
He 1
was 1
pale 1
but 1
absolutely 1
calm 1
I 1
have 1
done 1
what 1
you 1
asked 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
he 1
muttered 1
And 1
now 1
good 1
bye 1
Let 1
us 1
never 1
see 1
each 1
other 1
again 1
You 1
have 1
saved 1
me 1
from 1
ruin 1
Alan 1
I 1
cannot 1
forget 1
that 1
said 1
Dorian 1
simply 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
Campbell 1
had 1
left 1
he 1
went 1
upstairs 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
horrible 1
smell 1
of 1
nitric 1
acid 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
But 1
the 1
thing 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
sitting 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
was 1
gone 1
CHAPTER 1
That 1
evening 1
at 1
eight 1
thirty 1
exquisitely 1
dressed 1
and 1
wearing 1
a 1
large 1
button 1
hole 1
of 1
Parma 1
violets 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
was 1
ushered 1
into 1
Lady 1
Narborough 1
s 1
drawing 1
room 1
by 1
bowing 1
servants 1
His 1
forehead 1
was 1
throbbing 1
with 1
maddened 1
nerves 1
and 1
he 1
felt 1
wildly 1
excited 1
but 1
his 1
manner 1
as 1
he 1
bent 1
over 1
his 1
hostess 1
s 1
hand 1
was 1
as 1
easy 1
and 1
graceful 1
as 1
ever 1
Perhaps 1
one 1
never 1
seems 1
so 1
much 1
at 1
one 1
s 1
ease 1
as 1
when 1
one 1
has 1
to 1
play 1
a 1
part 1
Certainly 1
no 1
one 1
looking 1
at 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
that 1
night 1
could 1
have 1
believed 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
passed 1
through 1
a 1
tragedy 1
as 1
horrible 1
as 1
any 1
tragedy 1
of 1
our 1
age 1
Those 1
finely 1
shaped 1
fingers 1
could 1
never 1
have 1
clutched 1
a 1
knife 1
for 1
sin 1
nor 1
those 1
smiling 1
lips 1
have 1
cried 1
out 1
on 1
God 1
and 1
goodness 1
He 1
himself 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
wondering 1
at 1
the 1
calm 1
of 1
his 1
demeanour 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
felt 1
keenly 1
the 1
terrible 1
pleasure 1
of 1
a 1
double 1
life 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
party 1
got 1
up 1
rather 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
by 1
Lady 1
Narborough 1
who 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
clever 1
woman 1
with 1
what 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
used 1
to 1
describe 1
as 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
really 1
remarkable 1
ugliness 1
She 1
had 1
proved 1
an 1
excellent 1
wife 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
our 1
most 1
tedious 1
ambassadors 1
and 1
having 1
buried 1
her 1
husband 1
properly 1
in 1
a 1
marble 1
mausoleum 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
herself 1
designed 1
and 1
married 1
off 1
her 1
daughters 1
to 1
some 1
rich 1
rather 1
elderly 1
men 1
she 1
devoted 1
herself 1
now 1
to 1
the 1
pleasures 1
of 1
French 1
fiction 1
French 1
cookery 1
and 1
French 1
esprit 1
when 1
she 1
could 1
get 1
it 1
Dorian 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
her 1
especial 1
favourites 1
and 1
she 1
always 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
extremely 1
glad 1
she 1
had 1
not 1
met 1
him 1
in 1
early 1
life 1
I 1
know 1
my 1
dear 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
fallen 1
madly 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
you 1
she 1
used 1
to 1
say 1
and 1
thrown 1
my 1
bonnet 1
right 1
over 1
the 1
mills 1
for 1
your 1
sake 1
It 1
is 1
most 1
fortunate 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
not 1
thought 1
of 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
As 1
it 1
was 1
our 1
bonnets 1
were 1
so 1
unbecoming 1
and 1
the 1
mills 1
were 1
so 1
occupied 1
in 1
trying 1
to 1
raise 1
the 1
wind 1
that 1
I 1
never 1
had 1
even 1
a 1
flirtation 1
with 1
anybody 1
However 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
Narborough 1
s 1
fault 1
He 1
was 1
dreadfully 1
short 1
sighted 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
pleasure 1
in 1
taking 1
in 1
a 1
husband 1
who 1
never 1
sees 1
anything 1
Her 1
guests 1
this 1
evening 1
were 1
rather 1
tedious 1
The 1
fact 1
was 1
as 1
she 1
explained 1
to 1
Dorian 1
behind 1
a 1
very 1
shabby 1
fan 1
one 1
of 1
her 1
married 1
daughters 1
had 1
come 1
up 1
quite 1
suddenly 1
to 1
stay 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
to 1
make 1
matters 1
worse 1
had 1
actually 1
brought 1
her 1
husband 1
with 1
her 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
most 1
unkind 1
of 1
her 1
my 1
dear 1
she 1
whispered 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
go 1
and 1
stay 1
with 1
them 1
every 1
summer 1
after 1
I 1
come 1
from 1
Homburg 1
but 1
then 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
like 1
me 1
must 1
have 1
fresh 1
air 1
sometimes 1
and 1
besides 1
I 1
really 1
wake 1
them 1
up 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
an 1
existence 1
they 1
lead 1
down 1
there 1
It 1
is 1
pure 1
unadulterated 1
country 1
life 1
They 1
get 1
up 1
early 1
because 1
they 1
have 1
so 1
much 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
go 1
to 1
bed 1
early 1
because 1
they 1
have 1
so 1
little 1
to 1
think 1
about 1
There 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
a 1
scandal 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
since 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
Queen 1
Elizabeth 1
and 1
consequently 1
they 1
all 1
fall 1
asleep 1
after 1
dinner 1
You 1
shan 1
t 1
sit 1
next 1
either 1
of 1
them 1
You 1
shall 1
sit 1
by 1
me 1
and 1
amuse 1
me 1
Dorian 1
murmured 1
a 1
graceful 1
compliment 1
and 1
looked 1
round 1
the 1
room 1
Yes 1
it 1
was 1
certainly 1
a 1
tedious 1
party 1
Two 1
of 1
the 1
people 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
before 1
and 1
the 1
others 1
consisted 1
of 1
Ernest 1
Harrowden 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
middle 1
aged 1
mediocrities 1
so 1
common 1
in 1
London 1
clubs 1
who 1
have 1
no 1
enemies 1
but 1
are 1
thoroughly 1
disliked 1
by 1
their 1
friends 1
Lady 1
Ruxton 1
an 1
overdressed 1
woman 1
of 1
forty 1
seven 1
with 1
a 1
hooked 1
nose 1
who 1
was 1
always 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
herself 1
compromised 1
but 1
was 1
so 1
peculiarly 1
plain 1
that 1
to 1
her 1
great 1
disappointment 1
no 1
one 1
would 1
ever 1
believe 1
anything 1
against 1
her 1
Mrs 1
Erlynne 1
a 1
pushing 1
nobody 1
with 1
a 1
delightful 1
lisp 1
and 1
Venetian 1
red 1
hair 1
Lady 1
Alice 1
Chapman 1
his 1
hostess 1
s 1
daughter 1
a 1
dowdy 1
dull 1
girl 1
with 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
characteristic 1
British 1
faces 1
that 1
once 1
seen 1
are 1
never 1
remembered 1
and 1
her 1
husband 1
a 1
red 1
cheeked 1
white 1
whiskered 1
creature 1
who 1
like 1
so 1
many 1
of 1
his 1
class 1
was 1
under 1
the 1
impression 1
that 1
inordinate 1
joviality 1
can 1
atone 1
for 1
an 1
entire 1
lack 1
of 1
ideas 1
He 1
was 1
rather 1
sorry 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
till 1
Lady 1
Narborough 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
great 1
ormolu 1
gilt 1
clock 1
that 1
sprawled 1
in 1
gaudy 1
curves 1
on 1
the 1
mauve 1
draped 1
mantelshelf 1
exclaimed 1
How 1
horrid 1
of 1
Henry 1
Wotton 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
late 1
I 1
sent 1
round 1
to 1
him 1
this 1
morning 1
on 1
chance 1
and 1
he 1
promised 1
faithfully 1
not 1
to 1
disappoint 1
me 1
It 1
was 1
some 1
consolation 1
that 1
Harry 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
there 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
he 1
heard 1
his 1
slow 1
musical 1
voice 1
lending 1
charm 1
to 1
some 1
insincere 1
apology 1
he 1
ceased 1
to 1
feel 1
bored 1
But 1
at 1
dinner 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
eat 1
anything 1
Plate 1
after 1
plate 1
went 1
away 1
untasted 1
Lady 1
Narborough 1
kept 1
scolding 1
him 1
for 1
what 1
she 1
called 1
an 1
insult 1
to 1
poor 1
Adolphe 1
who 1
invented 1
the 1
menu 1
specially 1
for 1
you 1
and 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
looked 1
across 1
at 1
him 1
wondering 1
at 1
his 1
silence 1
and 1
abstracted 1
manner 1
From 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
the 1
butler 1
filled 1
his 1
glass 1
with 1
champagne 1
He 1
drank 1
eagerly 1
and 1
his 1
thirst 1
seemed 1
to 1
increase 1
Dorian 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
at 1
last 1
as 1
the 1
chaud 1
froid 1
was 1
being 1
handed 1
round 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
matter 1
with 1
you 1
to 1
night 1
You 1
are 1
quite 1
out 1
of 1
sorts 1
I 1
believe 1
he 1
is 1
in 1
love 1
cried 1
Lady 1
Narborough 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
afraid 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
for 1
fear 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
jealous 1
He 1
is 1
quite 1
right 1
I 1
certainly 1
should 1
Dear 1
Lady 1
Narborough 1
murmured 1
Dorian 1
smiling 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
in 1
love 1
for 1
a 1
whole 1
week 1
not 1
in 1
fact 1
since 1
Madame 1
de 1
Ferrol 1
left 1
town 1
How 1
you 1
men 1
can 1
fall 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
that 1
woman 1
exclaimed 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
I 1
really 1
cannot 1
understand 1
it 1
It 1
is 1
simply 1
because 1
she 1
remembers 1
you 1
when 1
you 1
were 1
a 1
little 1
girl 1
Lady 1
Narborough 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
She 1
is 1
the 1
one 1
link 1
between 1
us 1
and 1
your 1
short 1
frocks 1
She 1
does 1
not 1
remember 1
my 1
short 1
frocks 1
at 1
all 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
But 1
I 1
remember 1
her 1
very 1
well 1
at 1
Vienna 1
thirty 1
years 1
ago 1
and 1
how 1
decolletee 1
she 1
was 1
then 1
She 1
is 1
still 1
decolletee 1
he 1
answered 1
taking 1
an 1
olive 1
in 1
his 1
long 1
fingers 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
is 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
smart 1
gown 1
she 1
looks 1
like 1
an 1
edition 1
de 1
luxe 1
of 1
a 1
bad 1
French 1
novel 1
She 1
is 1
really 1
wonderful 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
surprises 1
Her 1
capacity 1
for 1
family 1
affection 1
is 1
extraordinary 1
When 1
her 1
third 1
husband 1
died 1
her 1
hair 1
turned 1
quite 1
gold 1
from 1
grief 1
How 1
can 1
you 1
Harry 1
cried 1
Dorian 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
most 1
romantic 1
explanation 1
laughed 1
the 1
hostess 1
But 1
her 1
third 1
husband 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
mean 1
to 1
say 1
Ferrol 1
is 1
the 1
fourth 1
Certainly 1
Lady 1
Narborough 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
believe 1
a 1
word 1
of 1
it 1
Well 1
ask 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
He 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
her 1
most 1
intimate 1
friends 1
Is 1
it 1
true 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
She 1
assures 1
me 1
so 1
Lady 1
Narborough 1
said 1
Dorian 1
I 1
asked 1
her 1
whether 1
like 1
Marguerite 1
de 1
Navarre 1
she 1
had 1
their 1
hearts 1
embalmed 1
and 1
hung 1
at 1
her 1
girdle 1
She 1
told 1
me 1
she 1
didn 1
t 1
because 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
had 2
any 1
hearts 1
at 1
all 1
Four 1
husbands 1
Upon 1
my 1
word 1
that 1
is 1
trop 1
de 1
zele 1
Trop 1
d 1
audace 1
I 1
tell 1
her 1
said 1
Dorian 1
Oh 1
she 1
is 1
audacious 1
enough 1
for 1
anything 1
my 1
dear 1
And 1
what 1
is 1
Ferrol 1
like 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
him 1
The 1
husbands 1
of 1
very 1
beautiful 1
women 1
belong 1
to 1
the 1
criminal 1
classes 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
sipping 1
his 1
wine 1
Lady 1
Narborough 1
hit 1
him 1
with 1
her 1
fan 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
surprised 1
that 1
the 1
world 1
says 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
extremely 1
wicked 1
But 1
what 1
world 1
says 1
that 1
asked 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
elevating 1
his 1
eyebrows 1
It 1
can 1
only 1
be 1
the 1
next 1
world 1
This 1
world 1
and 1
I 1
are 1
on 1
excellent 1
terms 1
Everybody 1
I 1
know 1
says 1
you 1
are 1
very 1
wicked 1
cried 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
shaking 1
her 1
head 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
looked 1
serious 1
for 1
some 1
moments 1
It 1
is 1
perfectly 1
monstrous 1
he 1
said 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
way 1
people 1
go 1
about 1
nowadays 1
saying 1
things 1
against 1
one 1
behind 1
one 1
s 1
back 1
that 1
are 1
absolutely 1
and 1
entirely 1
true 1
Isn 1
t 1
he 1
incorrigible 1
cried 1
Dorian 1
leaning 1
forward 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
I 1
hope 1
so 1
said 1
his 1
hostess 1
laughing 1
But 1
really 1
if 1
you 1
all 1
worship 1
Madame 1
de 1
Ferrol 1
in 1
this 1
ridiculous 1
way 1
I 1
shall 1
have 1
to 1
marry 1
again 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
fashion 1
You 1
will 1
never 1
marry 1
again 1
Lady 1
Narborough 1
broke 1
in 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
You 1
were 1
far 1
too 1
happy 1
When 1
a 1
woman 1
marries 1
again 1
it 1
is 1
because 1
she 1
detested 1
her 1
first 1
husband 1
When 1
a 1
man 1
marries 1
again 1
it 1
is 1
because 1
he 1
adored 1
his 1
first 1
wife 1
Women 1
try 1
their 1
luck 1
men 1
risk 1
theirs 1
Narborough 1
wasn 1
t 1
perfect 1
cried 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
If 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
loved 1
him 1
my 1
dear 1
lady 1
was 1
the 1
rejoinder 1
Women 1
love 1
us 1
for 1
our 1
defects 1
If 1
we 1
have 1
enough 1
of 1
them 1
they 1
will 1
forgive 1
us 1
everything 1
even 1
our 1
intellects 1
You 1
will 1
never 1
ask 1
me 1
to 1
dinner 1
again 1
after 1
saying 1
this 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
Lady 1
Narborough 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
true 1
Of 1
course 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
If 1
we 1
women 1
did 1
not 1
love 1
you 1
for 1
your 1
defects 1
where 1
would 1
you 1
all 1
be 1
Not 1
one 1
of 1
you 1
would 1
ever 1
be 1
married 1
You 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
set 1
of 1
unfortunate 1
bachelors 1
Not 1
however 1
that 2
would 1
alter 1
you 1
much 1
Nowadays 1
all 1
the 1
married 1
men 1
live 1
like 1
bachelors 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
bachelors 1
like 1
married 1
men 1
Fin 1
de 1
siecle 1
murmured 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Fin 1
du 1
globe 1
answered 1
his 1
hostess 1
I 1
wish 1
it 1
were 1
fin 1
du 1

said 1
Dorian 1
with 1
a 1
sigh 1
Life 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
disappointment 1
Ah 1
my 1
dear 1
cried 1
Lady 1
Narborough 1
putting 1
on 1
her 1
gloves 1
don 1
t 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
exhausted 1
life 1
When 1
a 1
man 1
says 1
that 1
one 1
knows 1
that 1
life 1
has 1
exhausted 1
him 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
is 1
very 1
wicked 1
and 1
I 1
sometimes 1
wish 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
but 1
you 1
are 1
made 1
to 1
be 1
good 1
you 1
look 1
so 1
good 1
I 1
must 1
find 1
you 1
a 1
nice 1
wife 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
should 1
get 1
married 1
I 1
am 1
always 1
telling 1
him 1
so 1
Lady 1
Narborough 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
with 1
a 1
bow 1
Well 1
we 1
must 1
look 1
out 1
for 1
a 1
suitable 1
match 1
for 1
him 1
I 1
shall 1
go 1
through 1
Debrett 1
carefully 1
to 1
night 1
and 1
draw 1
out 1
a 1
list 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
eligible 1
young 1
ladies 1
With 1
their 1
ages 1
Lady 1
Narborough 1
asked 1
Dorian 1
Of 1
course 1
with 1
their 1
ages 1
slightly 1
edited 1
But 1
nothing 1
must 1
be 1
done 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
I 1
want 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
what 1
The 1
Morning 1
Post 1
calls 1
a 1
suitable 1
alliance 1
and 1
I 1
want 1
you 1
both 1
to 1
be 1
happy 1
What 1
nonsense 1
people 1
talk 1
about 1
happy 1
marriages 1
exclaimed 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
A 1
man 1
can 1
be 1
happy 1
with 1
any 1
woman 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
he 1
does 1
not 1
love 1
her 1
Ah 1
what 1
a 1
cynic 1
you 1
are 1
cried 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
pushing 1
back 1
her 1
chair 1
and 1
nodding 1
to 1
Lady 1
Ruxton 1
You 1
must 1
come 1
and 1
dine 1
with 1
me 1
soon 1
again 1
You 1
are 1
really 1
an 1
admirable 1
tonic 1
much 1
better 1
than 1
what 1
Sir 1
Andrew 1
prescribes 1
for 1
me 1
You 1
must 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
people 1
you 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
meet 1
though 1
I 1
want 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
delightful 1
gathering 1
I 1
like 1
men 1
who 1
have 1
a 1
future 1
and 1
women 1
who 1
have 1
a 1
past 1
he 1
answered 1
Or 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
would 1
make 1
it 1
a 1
petticoat 1
party 1
I 1
fear 1
so 1
she 1
said 1
laughing 1
as 1
she 1
stood 1
up 1
A 1
thousand 1
pardons 1
my 1
dear 1
Lady 1
Ruxton 1
she 1
added 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
see 1
you 1
hadn 1
t 1
finished 1
your 1
cigarette 1
Never 1
mind 1
Lady 1
Narborough 1
I 1
smoke 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
too 1
much 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
limit 1
myself 1
for 1
the 1
future 1
Pray 1
don 1
t 1
Lady 1
Ruxton 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Moderation 1
is 1
a 1
fatal 1
thing 1
Enough 1
is 1
as 1
bad 1
as 1
a 1
meal 1
More 1
than 1
enough 1
is 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
a 1
feast 1
Lady 1
Ruxton 1
glanced 1
at 1
him 1
curiously 1
You 1
must 1
come 1
and 1
explain 1
that 1
to 1
me 1
some 1
afternoon 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
It 1
sounds 1
a 1
fascinating 1
theory 1
she 1
murmured 1
as 1
she 1
swept 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
Now 1
mind 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
stay 1
too 1
long 1
over 1
your 1
politics 1
and 1
scandal 1
cried 1
Lady 1
Narborough 1
from 1
the 1
door 1
If 1
you 1
do 1
we 1
are 1
sure 1
to 1
squabble 1
upstairs 1
The 1
men 1
laughed 1
and 1
Mr 1
Chapman 1
got 1
up 1
solemnly 1
from 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
changed 1
his 1
seat 1
and 1
went 1
and 1
sat 1
by 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Mr 1
Chapman 1
began 1
to 1
talk 1
in 1
a 1
loud 1
voice 1
about 1
the 1
situation 1
in 1
the 1
House 1
of 1
Commons 1
He 1
guffawed 1
at 1
his 1
adversaries 1
The 1
word 1
doctrinaire 1
word 1
full 1
of 1
terror 1
to 1
the 1
British 1
mind 1
reappeared 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
between 1
his 1
explosions 1
An 1
alliterative 1
prefix 1
served 1
as 1
an 1
ornament 1
of 1
oratory 1
He 1
hoisted 1
the 1
Union 1
Jack 1
on 1
the 1
pinnacles 1
of 1
thought 1
The 1
inherited 1
stupidity 1
of 1
the 1
race 1
sound 1
English 1
common 1
sense 1
he 1
jovially 1
termed 1
it 1
was 1
shown 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
proper 1
bulwark 1
for 1
society 1
A 1
smile 1
curved 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
s 1
lips 1
and 1
he 1
turned 1
round 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
Dorian 1
Are 1
you 1
better 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
he 1
asked 1
You 1
seemed 1
rather 1
out 1
of 1
sorts 1
at 1
dinner 1
I 1
am 1
quite 1
well 1
Harry 1
I 1
am 1
tired 1
That 1
is 1
all 1
You 1
were 1
charming 1
last 1
night 1
The 1
little 1
duchess 1
is 1
quite 1
devoted 1
to 1
you 1
She 1
tells 1
me 1
she 1
is 1
going 1
down 1
to 1
Selby 1
She 1
has 1
promised 1
to 1
come 1
on 1
the 1
twentieth 1
Is 1
Monmouth 1
to 1
be 1
there 1
too 1
Oh 1
yes 1
Harry 1
He 1
bores 1
me 1
dreadfully 1
almost 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
he 1
bores 1
her 1
She 1
is 1
very 1
clever 1
too 1
clever 1
for 1
a 1
woman 1
She 1
lacks 1
the 1
indefinable 1
charm 1
of 1
weakness 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
feet 1
of 1
clay 1
that 1
make 1
the 1
gold 1
of 1
the 1
image 1
precious 1
Her 1
feet 1
are 1
very 1
pretty 1
but 1
they 1
are 1
not 1
feet 1
of 1
clay 1
White 1
porcelain 1
feet 1
if 1
you 1
like 1
They 1
have 1
been 1
through 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
what 1
fire 1
does 1
not 1
destroy 1
it 1
hardens 1
She 1
has 1
had 1
experiences 1
How 1
long 1
has 1
she 1
been 1
married 1
asked 1
Dorian 1
An 1
eternity 1
she 1
tells 1
me 1
I 1
believe 1
according 1
to 1
the 1
peerage 1
it 1
is 1
ten 1
years 1
but 1
ten 1
years 1
with 1
Monmouth 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
like 1
eternity 1
with 1
time 1
thrown 1
in 1
Who 1
else 1
is 1
coming 1
Oh 1
the 1
Willoughbys 1
Lord 1
Rugby 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
our 1
hostess 1
Geoffrey 1
Clouston 1
the 1
usual 1
set 1
I 1
have 1
asked 1
Lord 1
Grotrian 1
I 1
like 1
him 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
A 1
great 1
many 1
people 1
don 1
t 1
but 1
I 1
find 1
him 1
charming 1
He 1
atones 1
for 1
being 1
occasionally 1
somewhat 1
overdressed 1
by 1
being 1
always 1
absolutely 1
over 1
educated 1
He 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
modern 1
type 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
if 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
come 1
Harry 1
He 1
may 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
Monte 1
Carlo 1
with 1
his 1
father 1
Ah 1
what 1
a 1
nuisance 1
people 1
s 1
people 1
are 1
Try 1
and 1
make 1
him 1
come 1
By 1
the 1
way 1
Dorian 1
you 1
ran 1
off 1
very 1
early 1
last 1
night 1
You 1
left 1
before 1
eleven 1
What 1
did 1
you 1
do 1
afterwards 1
Did 1
you 1
go 1
straight 1
home 1
Dorian 1
glanced 1
at 1
him 1
hurriedly 1
and 1
frowned 1
No 1
Harry 1
he 1
said 1
at 1
last 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
get 1
home 1
till 1
nearly 1
three 1
Did 1
you 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
club 1
Yes 1
he 1
answered 1
Then 1
he 1
bit 1
his 1
lip 1
No 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
mean 1
that 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
club 1
I 1
walked 1
about 1
I 1
forget 1
what 1
I 1
did 1
How 1
inquisitive 1
you 1
are 1
Harry 1
You 1
always 1
want 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
one 1
has 1
been 1
doing 1
I 1
always 1
want 1
to 1
forget 1
what 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
doing 1
I 1
came 1
in 1
at 1
half 1
past 1
two 1
if 1
you 1
wish 1
to 1
know 1
the 1
exact 1
time 1
I 1
had 1
left 1
my 1
latch 1
key 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
my 1
servant 1
had 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
in 1
If 1
you 1
want 1
any 1
corroborative 1
evidence 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
you 1
can 1
ask 1
him 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
as 1
if 1
I 1
cared 1
Let 1
us 1
go 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
drawing 1
room 1
No 1
sherry 1
thank 1
you 1
Mr 1
Chapman 1
Something 1
has 1
happened 1
to 1
you 1
Dorian 1
Tell 1
me 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
You 1
are 1
not 1
yourself 1
to 1
night 1
Don 1
t 1
mind 1
me 1
Harry 1
I 1
am 1
irritable 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
temper 1
I 1
shall 1
come 1
round 1
and 1
see 1
you 1
to 1
morrow 1
or 1
next 1
day 1
Make 1
my 1
excuses 1
to 1
Lady 1
Narborough 1
I 1
shan 1
t 1
go 1
upstairs 1
I 1
shall 1
go 1
home 1
I 1
must 1
go 1
home 1
All 1
right 1
Dorian 1
I 1
dare 1
say 1
I 1
shall 1
see 1
you 1
to 1
morrow 1
at 1
tea 1
time 1
The 1
duchess 1
is 1
coming 1
I 1
will 1
try 1
to 1
be 1
there 1
Harry 1
he 1
said 1
leaving 1
the 1
room 1
As 1
he 1
drove 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
own 1
house 1
he 1
was 1
conscious 1
that 1
the 1
sense 1
of 1
terror 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
had 1
strangled 1
had 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
him 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
s 1
casual 1
questioning 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
lose 1
his 1
nerve 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
and 1
he 1
wanted 1
his 1
nerve 1
still 1
Things 1
that 1
were 1
dangerous 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
destroyed 1
He 1
winced 1
He 1
hated 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
even 1
touching 1
them 1
Yet 1
it 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
He 1
realized 1
that 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
locked 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
his 1
library 1
he 1
opened 1
the 1
secret 1
press 1
into 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
thrust 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
s 1
coat 1
and 1
bag 1
A 1
huge 1
fire 1
was 1
blazing 1
He 1
piled 1
another 1
log 1
on 1
it 1
The 1
smell 1
of 1
the 1
singeing 1
clothes 1
and 1
burning 1
leather 1
was 1
horrible 1
It 1
took 1
him 1
three 1
quarters 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
to 1
consume 1
everything 1
At 1
the 1
end 1
he 1
felt 1
faint 1
and 1
sick 1
and 1
having 1
lit 1
some 1
Algerian 1
pastilles 1
in 1
a 1
pierced 1
copper 1
brazier 1
he 1
bathed 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
forehead 1
with 1
a 1
cool 1
musk 1
scented 1
vinegar 1
Suddenly 1
he 1
started 1
His 1
eyes 1
grew 1
strangely 1
bright 1
and 1
he 1
gnawed 1
nervously 1
at 1
his 1
underlip 1
Between 1
two 1
of 1
the 1
windows 1
stood 1
a 1
large 1
Florentine 1
cabinet 1
made 1
out 1
of 1
ebony 1
and 1
inlaid 1
with 1
ivory 1
and 1
blue 1
lapis 1
He 1
watched 1
it 1
as 1
though 1
it 1
were 1
a 1
thing 1
that 1
could 1
fascinate 1
and 1
make 1
afraid 1
as 1
though 1
it 1
held 1
something 1
that 1
he 1
longed 1
for 1
and 1
yet 1
almost 1
loathed 1
His 1
breath 1
quickened 1
A 1
mad 1
craving 1
came 1
over 1
him 1
He 1
lit 1
a 1
cigarette 1
and 1
then 1
threw 1
it 1
away 1
His 1
eyelids 1
drooped 1
till 1
the 1
long 1
fringed 1
lashes 1
almost 1
touched 1
his 1
cheek 1
But 1
he 1
still 1
watched 1
the 1
cabinet 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
sofa 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
lying 1
went 1
over 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
having 1
unlocked 1
it 1
touched 1
some 1
hidden 1
spring 1
A 1
triangular 1
drawer 1
passed 1
slowly 1
out 1
His 1
fingers 1
moved 1
instinctively 1
towards 1
it 1
dipped 1
in 1
and 1
closed 1
on 1
something 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
Chinese 1
box 1
of 1
black 1
and 1
gold 1
dust 1
lacquer 1
elaborately 1
wrought 1
the 1
sides 1
patterned 1
with 1
curved 1
waves 1
and 1
the 1
silken 1
cords 1
hung 1
with 1
round 1
crystals 1
and 1
tasselled 1
in 1
plaited 1
metal 1
threads 1
He 1
opened 1
it 1
Inside 1
was 1
a 1
green 1
paste 1
waxy 1
in 1
lustre 1
the 1
odour 1
curiously 1
heavy 1
and 1
persistent 1
He 1
hesitated 1
for 1
some 1
moments 1
with 1
a 1
strangely 1
immobile 1
smile 1
upon 1
his 1
face 1
Then 1
shivering 1
though 1
the 1
atmosphere 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
was 1
terribly 1
hot 1
he 1
drew 1
himself 1
up 1
and 1
glanced 1
at 1
the 1
clock 1
It 1
was 1
twenty 1
minutes 1
to 1
twelve 1
He 1
put 1
the 1
box 1
back 1
shutting 1
the 1
cabinet 1
doors 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
so 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
his 1
bedroom 1
As 1
midnight 1
was 1
striking 1
bronze 1
blows 1
upon 1
the 1
dusky 1
air 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
dressed 1
commonly 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
muffler 1
wrapped 1
round 1
his 1
throat 1
crept 1
quietly 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
house 1
In 1
Bond 1
Street 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
hansom 1
with 1
a 1
good 1
horse 1
He 1
hailed 1
it 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
voice 1
gave 1
the 1
driver 1
an 1
address 1
The 1
man 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
It 1
is 1
too 1
far 1
for 1
me 1
he 1
muttered 1
Here 1
is 1
a 1
sovereign 1
for 1
you 1
said 1
Dorian 1
You 1
shall 1
have 1
another 1
if 1
you 1
drive 1
fast 1
All 1
right 1
sir 1
answered 1
the 1
man 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
there 1
in 1
an 1
hour 1
and 1
after 1
his 1
fare 1
had 1
got 1
in 1
he 1
turned 1
his 1
horse 1
round 1
and 1
drove 1
rapidly 1
towards 1
the 1
river 1
CHAPTER 1
A 1
cold 1
rain 1
began 1
to 1
fall 1
and 1
the 1
blurred 1
street 1
lamps 1
looked 1
ghastly 1
in 1
the 1
dripping 1
mist 1
The 1
public 1
houses 1
were 1
just 1
closing 1
and 1
dim 1
men 1
and 1
women 1
were 1
clustering 1
in 1
broken 1
groups 1
round 1
their 1
doors 1
From 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
bars 1
came 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
horrible 1
laughter 1
In 1
others 1
drunkards 1
brawled 1
and 1
screamed 1
Lying 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
hansom 1
with 1
his 1
hat 1
pulled 1
over 1
his 1
forehead 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
watched 1
with 1
listless 1
eyes 1
the 1
sordid 1
shame 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
city 1
and 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
repeated 1
to 1
himself 1
the 1
words 1
that 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
had 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
they 1
had 1
met 1
To 1
cure 1
the 1
soul 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
the 1
senses 1
and 1
the 1
senses 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
the 1
soul 1
Yes 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
secret 1
He 1
had 1
often 1
tried 1
it 1
and 1
would 1
try 1
it 1
again 1
now 1
There 1
were 1
opium 1
dens 1
where 1
one 1
could 1
buy 1
oblivion 1
dens 1
of 1
horror 1
where 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
old 1
sins 1
could 1
be 1
destroyed 1
by 1
the 1
madness 1
of 1
sins 1
that 1
were 1
new 1
The 1
moon 1
hung 1
low 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
like 1
a 1
yellow 1
skull 1
From 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
a 1
huge 1
misshapen 1
cloud 1
stretched 1
a 1
long 1
arm 1
across 1
and 1
hid 1
it 1
The 1
gas 1
lamps 1
grew 1
fewer 1
and 1
the 1
streets 1
more 1
narrow 1
and 1
gloomy 1
Once 1
the 1
man 1
lost 1
his 1
way 1
and 1
had 1
to 1
drive 1
back 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
A 1
steam 1
rose 1
from 1
the 1
horse 1
as 1
it 1
splashed 1
up 1
the 1
puddles 1
The 1
sidewindows 1
of 1
the 1
hansom 1
were 1
clogged 1
with 1
a 1
grey 1
flannel 1
mist 1
To 1
cure 1
the 1
soul 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
the 1
senses 1
and 1
the 1
senses 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
the 1
soul 1
How 1
the 1
words 1
rang 1
in 1
his 1
ears 1
His 1
soul 1
certainly 1
was 1
sick 1
to 1
death 1
Was 1
it 1
true 1
that 1
the 1
senses 1
could 1
cure 1
it 1
Innocent 1
blood 1
had 1
been 1
spilled 1
What 1
could 1
atone 1
for 1
that 1
Ah 1
for 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
atonement 1
but 1
though 1
forgiveness 1
was 1
impossible 1
forgetfulness 1
was 1
possible 1
still 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
determined 1
to 1
forget 1
to 1
stamp 1
the 1
thing 1
out 1
to 1
crush 1
it 1
as 1
one 1
would 1
crush 1
the 1
adder 1
that 1
had 1
stung 1
one 1
Indeed 1
what 1
right 1
had 1
Basil 1
to 1
have 1
spoken 1
to 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
Who 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
a 1
judge 1
over 1
others 1
He 1
had 1
said 1
things 1
that 1
were 1
dreadful 1
horrible 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
endured 1
On 1
and 1
on 1
plodded 1
the 1
hansom 1
going 1
slower 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
at 1
each 1
step 1
He 1
thrust 1
up 1
the 1
trap 1
and 1
called 1
to 1
the 1
man 1
to 1
drive 1
faster 1
The 1
hideous 1
hunger 1
for 1
opium 1
began 1
to 1
gnaw 1
at 1
him 1
His 1
throat 1
burned 1
and 1
his 1
delicate 1
hands 1
twitched 1
nervously 1
together 1
He 1
struck 1
at 1
the 1
horse 1
madly 1
with 1
his 1
stick 1
The 1
driver 1
laughed 1
and 1
whipped 1
up 1
He 1
laughed 1
in 1
answer 1
and 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
silent 1
The 1
way 1
seemed 1
interminable 1
and 1
the 1
streets 1
like 1
the 1
black 1
web 1
of 1
some 1
sprawling 1
spider 1
The 1
monotony 1
became 1
unbearable 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
mist 1
thickened 1
he 1
felt 1
afraid 1
Then 1
they 1
passed 1
by 1
lonely 1
brickfields 1
The 1
fog 1
was 1
lighter 1
here 1
and 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
strange 1
bottle 1
shaped 1
kilns 1
with 1
their 1
orange 1
fanlike 1
tongues 1
of 1
fire 1
A 1
dog 1
barked 1
as 1
they 1
went 1
by 1
and 1
far 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
some 1
wandering 1
sea 1
gull 1
screamed 1
The 1
horse 1
stumbled 1
in 1
a 1
rut 1
then 1
swerved 1
aside 1
and 1
broke 1
into 1
a 1
gallop 1
After 1
some 1
time 1
they 1
left 1
the 1
clay 1
road 1
and 1
rattled 1
again 1
over 1
rough 1
paven 1
streets 1
Most 1
of 1
the 1
windows 1
were 1
dark 1
but 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
fantastic 1
shadows 1
were 1
silhouetted 1
against 1
some 1
lamplit 1
blind 1
He 1
watched 1
them 1
curiously 1
They 1
moved 1
like 1
monstrous 1
marionettes 1
and 1
made 1
gestures 1
like 1
live 1
things 1
He 1
hated 1
them 1
A 1
dull 1
rage 1
was 1
in 1
his 1
heart 1
As 1
they 1
turned 1
a 1
corner 1
a 1
woman 1
yelled 1
something 1
at 1
them 1
from 1
an 1
open 1
door 1
and 1
two 1
men 1
ran 1
after 1
the 1
hansom 1
for 1
about 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
The 1
driver 1
beat 1
at 1
them 1
with 1
his 1
whip 1
It 1
is 1
said 1
that 1
passion 1
makes 1
one 1
think 1
in 1
a 1
circle 1
Certainly 1
with 1
hideous 1
iteration 1
the 1
bitten 1
lips 1
of 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
shaped 1
and 1
reshaped 1
those 1
subtle 1
words 1
that 1
dealt 1
with 1
soul 1
and 1
sense 1
till 1
he 1
had 1
found 1
in 1
them 1
the 1
full 1
expression 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
of 1
his 1
mood 1
and 1
justified 1
by 1
intellectual 1
approval 1
passions 1
that 1
without 1
such 1
justification 1
would 1
still 1
have 1
dominated 1
his 1
temper 1
From 1
cell 1
to 1
cell 1
of 1
his 1
brain 1
crept 1
the 1
one 1
thought 1
and 1
the 1
wild 1
desire 1
to 1
live 1
most 1
terrible 1
of 1
all 1
man 1
s 1
appetites 1
quickened 1
into 1
force 1
each 1
trembling 1
nerve 1
and 1
fibre 1
Ugliness 1
that 1
had 1
once 1
been 1
hateful 1
to 1
him 1
because 1
it 1
made 1
things 1
real 1
became 1
dear 1
to 1
him 1
now 1
for 1
that 1
very 1
reason 1
Ugliness 1
was 1
the 1
one 1
reality 1
The 1
coarse 1
brawl 1
the 1
loathsome 1
den 1
the 1
crude 1
violence 1
of 1
disordered 1
life 1
the 1
very 1
vileness 1
of 1
thief 1
and 1
outcast 1
were 1
more 1
vivid 1
in 1
their 1
intense 1
actuality 1
of 1
impression 1
than 1
all 1
the 1
gracious 1
shapes 1
of 1
art 1
the 1
dreamy 1
shadows 1
of 1
song 1
They 1
were 1
what 1
he 1
needed 1
for 1
forgetfulness 1
In 1
three 1
days 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
free 1
Suddenly 1
the 1
man 1
drew 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
jerk 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
a 1
dark 1
lane 1
Over 1
the 1
low 1
roofs 1
and 1
jagged 1
chimney 1
stacks 1
of 1
the 1
houses 1
rose 1
the 1
black 1
masts 1
of 1
ships 1
Wreaths 1
of 1
white 1
mist 1
clung 1
like 1
ghostly 1
sails 1
to 1
the 1
yards 1
Somewhere 1
about 1
here 1
sir 1
ain 1
t 1
it 1
he 1
asked 1
huskily 1
through 1
the 1
trap 1
Dorian 1
started 1
and 1
peered 1
round 1
This 1
will 1
do 1
he 1
answered 1
and 1
having 1
got 1
out 1
hastily 1
and 1
given 1
the 1
driver 1
the 1
extra 1
fare 1
he 1
had 1
promised 1
him 1
he 1
walked 1
quickly 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
quay 1
Here 1
and 1
there 1
a 1
lantern 1
gleamed 1
at 1
the 1
stern 1
of 1
some 1
huge 1
merchantman 1
The 1
light 1
shook 1
and 1
splintered 1
in 1
the 1
puddles 1
A 1
red 1
glare 1
came 1
from 1
an 1
outward 1
bound 1
steamer 1
that 1
was 1
coaling 1
The 1
slimy 1
pavement 1
looked 1
like 1
a 1
wet 1
mackintosh 1
He 1
hurried 1
on 1
towards 1
the 1
left 1
glancing 1
back 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
being 1
followed 1
In 1
about 1
seven 1
or 1
eight 1
minutes 1
he 1
reached 1
a 1
small 1
shabby 1
house 1
that 1
was 1
wedged 1
in 1
between 1
two 1
gaunt 1
factories 1
In 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
top 1
windows 1
stood 1
a 1
lamp 1
He 1
stopped 1
and 1
gave 1
a 1
peculiar 1
knock 1
After 1
a 1
little 1
time 1
he 1
heard 1
steps 1
in 1
the 1
passage 1
and 1
the 1
chain 1
being 1
unhooked 1
The 1
door 1
opened 1
quietly 1
and 1
he 1
went 1
in 1
without 1
saying 1
a 1
word 1
to 1
the 1
squat 1
misshapen 1
figure 1
that 1
flattened 1
itself 1
into 1
the 1
shadow 1
as 1
he 1
passed 1
At 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
hung 1
a 1
tattered 1
green 1
curtain 1
that 1
swayed 1
and 1
shook 1
in 1
the 1
gusty 1
wind 1
which 1
had 1
followed 1
him 1
in 1
from 1
the 1
street 1
He 1
dragged 1
it 1
aside 1
and 1
entered 1
a 1
long 1
low 1
room 1
which 1
looked 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
once 1
been 1
a 1
third 1
rate 1
dancing 1
saloon 1
Shrill 1
flaring 1
gas 1
jets 1
dulled 1
and 1
distorted 1
in 1
the 1
fly 1
blown 1
mirrors 1
that 1
faced 1
them 1
were 1
ranged 1
round 1
the 1
walls 1
Greasy 1
reflectors 1
of 1
ribbed 1
tin 1
backed 1
them 1
making 1
quivering 1
disks 1
of 1
light 1
The 1
floor 1
was 1
covered 1
with 1
ochre 1
coloured 1
sawdust 1
trampled 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
into 1
mud 1
and 1
stained 1
with 1
dark 1
rings 1
of 1
spilled 1
liquor 1
Some 1
Malays 1
were 1
crouching 1
by 1
a 1
little 1
charcoal 1
stove 1
playing 1
with 1
bone 1
counters 1
and 1
showing 1
their 1
white 1
teeth 1
as 1
they 1
chattered 1
In 1
one 1
corner 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
buried 1
in 1
his 1
arms 1
a 1
sailor 1
sprawled 1
over 1
a 1
table 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
tawdrily 1
painted 1
bar 1
that 1
ran 1
across 1
one 1
complete 1
side 1
stood 1
two 1
haggard 1
women 1
mocking 1
an 1
old 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
brushing 1
the 1
sleeves 1
of 1
his 1
coat 1
with 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
disgust 1
He 1
thinks 1
he 1
s 1
got 1
red 1
ants 1
on 1
him 1
laughed 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
as 1
Dorian 1
passed 1
by 1
The 1
man 1
looked 1
at 1
her 1
in 1
terror 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
whimper 1
At 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
staircase 1
leading 1
to 1
a 1
darkened 1
chamber 1
As 1
Dorian 1
hurried 1
up 1
its 1
three 1
rickety 1
steps 1
the 1
heavy 1
odour 1
of 1
opium 1
met 1
him 1
He 1
heaved 1
a 1
deep 1
breath 1
and 1
his 1
nostrils 1
quivered 1
with 1
pleasure 1
When 1
he 1
entered 1
a 1
young 1
man 1
with 1
smooth 1
yellow 1
hair 1
who 1
was 1
bending 1
over 1
a 1
lamp 1
lighting 1
a 1
long 1
thin 1
pipe 1
looked 1
up 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
nodded 1
in 1
a 1
hesitating 1
manner 1
You 1
here 1
Adrian 1
muttered 1
Dorian 1
Where 1
else 1
should 1
I 1
be 1
he 1
answered 1
listlessly 1
None 1
of 1
the 1
chaps 1
will 1
speak 1
to 1
me 1
now 1
I 1
thought 1
you 1
had 1
left 1
England 1
Darlington 1
is 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
My 1
brother 1
paid 1
the 1
bill 1
at 1
last 1
George 1
doesn 1
t 1
speak 1
to 1
me 1
either 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
he 1
added 1
with 1
a 1
sigh 1
As 1
long 1
as 1
one 1
has 1
this 1
stuff 1
one 1
doesn 1
t 1
want 1
friends 1
I 1
think 1
I 1
have 1
had 1
too 1
many 1
friends 1
Dorian 1
winced 1
and 1
looked 1
round 1
at 1
the 1
grotesque 1
things 1
that 1
lay 1
in 1
such 1
fantastic 1
postures 1
on 1
the 1
ragged 1
mattresses 1
The 1
twisted 1
limbs 1
the 1
gaping 1
mouths 1
the 1
staring 1
lustreless 1
eyes 1
fascinated 1
him 1
He 1
knew 1
in 1
what 1
strange 1
heavens 1
they 1
were 1
suffering 1
and 1
what 1
dull 1
hells 1
were 1
teaching 1
them 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
some 1
new 1
joy 1
They 1
were 1
better 1
off 1
than 1
he 1
was 1
He 1
was 1
prisoned 1
in 1
thought 1
Memory 1
like 1
a 1
horrible 1
malady 1
was 1
eating 1
his 1
soul 1
away 1
From 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
looking 1
at 1
him 1
Yet 1
he 1
felt 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
stay 1
The 1
presence 1
of 1
Adrian 1
Singleton 1
troubled 1
him 1
He 1
wanted 1
to 1
be 1
where 1
no 1
one 1
would 1
know 1
who 1
he 1
was 1
He 1
wanted 1
to 1
escape 1
from 1
himself 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
place 1
he 1
said 1
after 1
a 1
pause 1
On 1
the 1
wharf 1
Yes 1
That 1
mad 1
cat 1
is 1
sure 1
to 1
be 1
there 1
They 1
won 1
t 1
have 1
her 1
in 1
this 1
place 1
now 1
Dorian 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
I 1
am 1
sick 1
of 1
women 1
who 1
love 1
one 1
Women 1
who 1
hate 1
one 1
are 1
much 1
more 1
interesting 1
Besides 1
the 1
stuff 1
is 1
better 1
Much 1
the 1
same 1
I 1
like 1
it 1
better 1
Come 1
and 1
have 1
something 1
to 1
drink 1
I 1
must 1
have 1
something 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
anything 1
murmured 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
Never 1
mind 1
Adrian 1
Singleton 1
rose 1
up 1
wearily 1
and 1
followed 1
Dorian 1
to 1
the 1
bar 1
A 1
half 1
caste 1
in 1
a 1
ragged 1
turban 1
and 1
a 1
shabby 1
ulster 1
grinned 1
a 1
hideous 1
greeting 1
as 1
he 1
thrust 1
a 1
bottle 1
of 1
brandy 1
and 1
two 1
tumblers 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
them 1
The 1
women 1
sidled 1
up 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
chatter 1
Dorian 1
turned 1
his 1
back 1
on 1
them 1
and 1
said 1
something 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
voice 1
to 1
Adrian 1
Singleton 1
A 1
crooked 1
smile 1
like 1
a 1
Malay 1
crease 1
writhed 1
across 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
women 1
We 1
are 1
very 1
proud 1
to 1
night 1
she 1
sneered 1
For 1
God 1
s 1
sake 1
don 1
t 1
talk 1
to 1
me 1
cried 1
Dorian 1
stamping 1
his 1
foot 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
Money 1
Here 1
it 1
is 1
Don 1
t 1
ever 1
talk 1
to 1
me 1
again 1
Two 1
red 1
sparks 1
flashed 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
in 1
the 1
woman 1
s 1
sodden 1
eyes 1
then 1
flickered 1
out 1
and 1
left 1
them 1
dull 1
and 1
glazed 1
She 1
tossed 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
raked 1
the 1
coins 1
off 1
the 1
counter 1
with 1
greedy 1
fingers 1
Her 1
companion 1
watched 1
her 1
enviously 1
It 1
s 1
no 1
use 1
sighed 1
Adrian 1
Singleton 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
What 1
does 1
it 1
matter 1
I 1
am 1
quite 1
happy 1
here 1
You 1
will 1
write 1
to 1
me 1
if 1
you 1
want 1
anything 1
won 1
t 1
you 1
said 1
Dorian 1
after 1
a 1
pause 1
Perhaps 1
Good 1
night 1
then 1
Good 1
night 1
answered 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
passing 1
up 1
the 1
steps 1
and 1
wiping 1
his 1
parched 1
mouth 1
with 1
a 1
handkerchief 1
Dorian 1
walked 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
pain 1
in 1
his 1
face 1
As 1
he 1
drew 1
the 1
curtain 1
aside 1
a 1
hideous 1
laugh 1
broke 1
from 1
the 1
painted 1
lips 1
of 1
the 1
woman 1
who 1
had 1
taken 1
his 1
money 1
There 1
goes 1
the 1
devil 1
s 1
bargain 1
she 1
hiccoughed 1
in 1
a 1
hoarse 1
voice 1
Curse 1
you 1
he 1
answered 1
don 1
t 1
call 1
me 1
that 1
She 1
snapped 1
her 1
fingers 1
Prince 1
Charming 1
is 1
what 1
you 1
like 1
to 1
be 1
called 1
ain 1
t 1
it 1
she 1
yelled 1
after 1
him 1
The 1
drowsy 1
sailor 1
leaped 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
as 1
she 1
spoke 1
and 1
looked 1
wildly 1
round 1
The 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
shutting 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
door 1
fell 1
on 1
his 1
ear 1
He 1
rushed 1
out 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
pursuit 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
hurried 1
along 1
the 1
quay 1
through 1
the 1
drizzling 1
rain 1
His 1
meeting 1
with 1
Adrian 1
Singleton 1
had 1
strangely 1
moved 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
wondered 1
if 1
the 1
ruin 1
of 1
that 1
young 1
life 1
was 1
really 1
to 1
be 1
laid 1
at 1
his 1
door 1
as 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
had 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
with 1
such 1
infamy 1
of 1
insult 1
He 1
bit 1
his 1
lip 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
seconds 1
his 1
eyes 1
grew 1
sad 1
Yet 1
after 1
all 1
what 1
did 1
it 1
matter 1
to 1
him 1
One 1
s 1
days 1
were 1
too 1
brief 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
burden 1
of 1
another 1
s 1
errors 1
on 1
one 1
s 1
shoulders 1
Each 1
man 1
lived 1
his 1
own 1
life 1
and 1
paid 1
his 1
own 1
price 1
for 1
living 1
it 1
The 1
only 1
pity 1
was 1
one 1
had 1
to 1
pay 1
so 1
often 1
for 1
a 1
single 1
fault 1
One 1
had 1
to 1
pay 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
again 1
indeed 1
In 1
her 1
dealings 1
with 1
man 1
destiny 1
never 1
closed 1
her 1
accounts 1
There 1
are 1
moments 1
psychologists 1
tell 1
us 1
when 1
the 1
passion 1
for 1
sin 1
or 1
for 1
what 1
the 1
world 1
calls 1
sin 1
so 1
dominates 1
a 1
nature 1
that 1
every 1
fibre 1
of 1
the 1
body 1
as 1
every 1
cell 1
of 1
the 1
brain 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
instinct 1
with 1
fearful 1
impulses 1
Men 1
and 1
women 1
at 1
such 1
moments 1
lose 1
the 1
freedom 1
of 1
their 1
will 1
They 1
move 1
to 1
their 1
terrible 1
end 1
as 1
automatons 1
move 1
Choice 1
is 1
taken 1
from 1
them 1
and 1
conscience 1
is 1
either 1
killed 1
or 1
if 1
it 1
lives 1
at 1
all 1
lives 1
but 1
to 1
give 1
rebellion 1
its 1
fascination 1
and 1
disobedience 1
its 1
charm 1
For 1
all 1
sins 1
as 1
theologians 1
weary 1
not 1
of 1
reminding 1
us 1
are 1
sins 1
of 1
disobedience 1
When 1
that 1
high 1
spirit 1
that 1
morning 1
star 1
of 1
evil 1
fell 1
from 1
heaven 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
a 1
rebel 1
that 1
he 1
fell 1
Callous 1
concentrated 1
on 1
evil 1
with 1
stained 1
mind 1
and 1
soul 1
hungry 1
for 1
rebellion 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
hastened 1
on 1
quickening 1
his 1
step 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
but 1
as 1
he 1
darted 1
aside 1
into 1
a 1
dim 1
archway 1
that 1
had 1
served 1
him 1
often 1
as 1
a 1
short 1
cut 1
to 1
the 1
ill 1
famed 1
place 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
he 1
felt 1
himself 1
suddenly 1
seized 1
from 1
behind 1
and 1
before 1
he 1
had 1
time 1
to 1
defend 1
himself 1
he 1
was 1
thrust 1
back 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
with 1
a 1
brutal 1
hand 1
round 1
his 1
throat 1
He 1
struggled 1
madly 1
for 1
life 1
and 1
by 1
a 1
terrible 1
effort 1
wrenched 1
the 1
tightening 1
fingers 1
away 1
In 1
a 1
second 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
click 1
of 1
a 1
revolver 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
gleam 1
of 1
a 1
polished 1
barrel 1
pointing 1
straight 1
at 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
the 1
dusky 1
form 1
of 1
a 1
short 1
thick 1
set 1
man 1
facing 1
him 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
he 1
gasped 1
Keep 1
quiet 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
If 1
you 1
stir 1
I 1
shoot 1
you 1
You 1
are 1
mad 1
What 1
have 1
I 1
done 1
to 1
you 1
You 1
wrecked 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
was 1
the 1
answer 1
and 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
was 1
my 1
sister 1
She 1
killed 1
herself 1
I 1
know 1
it 1
Her 1
death 1
is 1
at 1
your 1
door 1
I 1
swore 1
I 1
would 1
kill 1
you 1
in 1
return 1
For 1
years 1
I 1
have 1
sought 1
you 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
clue 1
no 1
trace 1
The 1
two 1
people 1
who 1
could 1
have 1
described 1
you 1
were 1
dead 1
I 1
knew 1
nothing 1
of 1
you 1
but 1
the 1
pet 1
name 1
she 1
used 1
to 1
call 1
you 1
I 1
heard 1
it 1
to 1
night 1
by 1
chance 1
Make 1
your 1
peace 1
with 1
God 1
for 1
to 1
night 1
you 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
die 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
grew 1
sick 1
with 1
fear 1
I 1
never 1
knew 1
her 1
he 1
stammered 1
I 1
never 1
heard 1
of 1
her 1
You 1
are 1
mad 1
You 1
had 1
better 1
confess 1
your 1
sin 1
for 1
as 1
sure 1
as 1
I 1
am 1
James 1
Vane 1
you 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
die 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
horrible 1
moment 1
Dorian 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
or 1
do 1
Down 1
on 1
your 1
knees 1
growled 1
the 1
man 1
I 1
give 1
you 1
one 1
minute 1
to 1
make 1
your 1
peace 1
no 1
more 1
I 1
go 1
on 1
board 1
to 1
night 1
for 1
India 1
and 1
I 1
must 1
do 1
my 1
job 1
first 1
One 1
minute 1
That 1
s 1
all 1
Dorian 1
s 1
arms 1
fell 1
to 1
his 1
side 1
Paralysed 1
with 1
terror 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
Suddenly 1
a 1
wild 1
hope 1
flashed 1
across 1
his 1
brain 1
Stop 1
he 1
cried 1
How 1
long 1
ago 1
is 1
it 1
since 1
your 1
sister 1
died 1
Quick 1
tell 1
me 1
Eighteen 1
years 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
Why 1
do 1
you 1
ask 1
me 1
What 1
do 1
years 1
matter 1
Eighteen 1
years 1
laughed 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
with 1
a 1
touch 1
of 1
triumph 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
Eighteen 1
years 1
Set 1
me 1
under 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
look 1
at 1
my 1
face 1
James 1
Vane 1
hesitated 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
not 1
understanding 1
what 1
was 1
meant 1
Then 1
he 1
seized 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
and 1
dragged 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
archway 1
Dim 1
and 1
wavering 1
as 1
was 1
the 1
wind 1
blown 1
light 1
yet 1
it 1
served 1
to 1
show 1
him 1
the 1
hideous 1
error 1
as 1
it 1
seemed 1
into 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
fallen 1
for 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
he 1
had 1
sought 1
to 1
kill 1
had 1
all 1
the 1
bloom 1
of 1
boyhood 1
all 1
the 1
unstained 1
purity 1
of 1
youth 1
He 1
seemed 1
little 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
lad 1
of 1
twenty 1
summers 1
hardly 1
older 1
if 1
older 1
indeed 1
at 1
all 1
than 1
his 1
sister 1
had 1
been 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
parted 1
so 1
many 1
years 1
ago 1
It 1
was 1
obvious 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
destroyed 1
her 1
life 1
He 1
loosened 1
his 1
hold 1
and 1
reeled 1
back 1
My 1
God 1
my 1
God 1
he 1
cried 1
and 1
I 1
would 1
have 1
murdered 1
you 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
drew 1
a 1
long 1
breath 1
You 1
have 1
been 1
on 1
the 1
brink 1
of 1
committing 1
a 1
terrible 1
crime 1
my 1
man 1
he 1
said 1
looking 1
at 1
him 1
sternly 1
Let 1
this 1
be 1
a 1
warning 1
to 1
you 1
not 1
to 1
take 1
vengeance 1
into 1
your 1
own 1
hands 1
Forgive 1
me 1
sir 1
muttered 1
James 1
Vane 1
I 1
was 1
deceived 1
A 1
chance 1
word 1
I 1
heard 1
in 1
that 1
damned 1
den 1
set 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
wrong 1
track 1
You 1
had 1
better 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
put 1
that 1
pistol 1
away 1
or 1
you 1
may 1
get 1
into 1
trouble 1
said 1
Dorian 1
turning 1
on 1
his 1
heel 1
and 1
going 1
slowly 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
James 1
Vane 1
stood 1
on 1
the 1
pavement 1
in 1
horror 1
He 1
was 1
trembling 1
from 1
head 1
to 1
foot 1
After 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
a 1
black 1
shadow 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
creeping 1
along 1
the 1
dripping 1
wall 1
moved 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
light 1
and 1
came 1
close 1
to 1
him 1
with 1
stealthy 1
footsteps 1
He 1
felt 1
a 1
hand 1
laid 1
on 1
his 1
arm 1
and 1
looked 1
round 1
with 1
a 1
start 1
It 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
women 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
drinking 1
at 1
the 1
bar 1
Why 1
didn 1
t 1
you 1
kill 1
him 1
she 1
hissed 1
out 1
putting 1
haggard 1
face 1
quite 1
close 1
to 1
his 1
I 1
knew 1
you 1
were 1
following 1
him 1
when 1
you 1
rushed 1
out 1
from 1
Daly 1
s 1
You 1
fool 1
You 1
should 1
have 1
killed 1
him 1
He 1
has 1
lots 1
of 1
money 1
and 1
he 1
s 1
as 1
bad 1
as 1
bad 1
He 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
man 1
I 1
am 1
looking 1
for 1
he 1
answered 1
and 1
I 1
want 1
no 1
man 1
s 1
money 1
I 1
want 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
life 1
The 1
man 1
whose 1
life 1
I 1
want 1
must 1
be 1
nearly 1
forty 1
now 1
This 1
one 1
is 1
little 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
boy 1
Thank 1
God 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
got 1
his 1
blood 1
upon 1
my 1
hands 1
The 1
woman 1
gave 1
a 1
bitter 1
laugh 1
Little 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
boy 1
she 1
sneered 1
Why 1
man 1
it 1
s 1
nigh 1
on 1
eighteen 1
years 1
since 1
Prince 1
Charming 1
made 1
me 1
what 1
I 1
am 1
You 1
lie 1
cried 1
James 1
Vane 1
She 1
raised 1
her 1
hand 1
up 1
to 1
heaven 1
Before 1
God 1
I 1
am 1
telling 1
the 1
truth 1
she 1
cried 1
Before 1
God 1
Strike 1
me 1
dumb 1
if 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
so 1
He 1
is 1
the 1
worst 1
one 1
that 1
comes 1
here 1
They 1
say 1
he 1
has 1
sold 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
devil 1
for 1
a 1
pretty 1
face 1
It 1
s 1
nigh 1
on 1
eighteen 1
years 1
since 1
I 1
met 1
him 1
He 1
hasn 1
t 1
changed 1
much 1
since 1
then 1
I 1
have 1
though 1
she 1
added 1
with 1
a 1
sickly 1
leer 1
You 1
swear 1
this 1
I 1
swear 1
it 1
came 1
in 1
hoarse 1
echo 1
from 1
her 1
flat 1
mouth 1
But 1
don 1
t 1
give 1
me 1
away 1
to 1
him 1
she 1
whined 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
of 1
him 1
Let 1
me 1
have 1
some 1
money 1
for 1
my 1
night 1
s 1
lodging 1
He 1
broke 1
from 1
her 1
with 1
an 1
oath 1
and 1
rushed 1
to 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
but 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
had 1
disappeared 1
When 1
he 1
looked 1
back 1
the 1
woman 1
had 1
vanished 1
also 1
CHAPTER 1
A 1
week 1
later 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
was 1
sitting 1
in 1
the 1
conservatory 1
at 1
Selby 1
Royal 1
talking 1
to 1
the 1
pretty 1
Duchess 1
of 1
Monmouth 1
who 1
with 1
her 1
husband 1
a 1
jaded 1
looking 1
man 1
of 1
sixty 1
was 1
amongst 1
his 1
guests 1
It 1
was 1
tea 1
time 1
and 1
the 1
mellow 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
huge 1
lace 1
covered 1
lamp 1
that 1
stood 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
lit 1
up 1
the 1
delicate 1
china 1
and 1
hammered 1
silver 1
of 1
the 1
service 1
at 1
which 1
the 1
duchess 1
was 1
presiding 1
Her 1
white 1
hands 1
were 1
moving 1
daintily 1
among 1
the 1
cups 1
and 1
her 1
full 1
red 1
lips 1
were 1
smiling 1
at 1
something 1
that 1
Dorian 1
had 1
whispered 1
to 1
her 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
was 1
lying 1
back 1
in 1
a 1
silk 1
draped 1
wicker 1
chair 1
looking 1
at 1
them 1
On 1
a 1
peach 1
coloured 1
divan 1
sat 1
Lady 1
Narborough 1
pretending 1
to 1
listen 1
to 1
the 1
duke 1
s 1
description 1
of 1
the 1
last 1
Brazilian 1
beetle 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
added 1
to 1
his 1
collection 1
Three 1
young 1
men 1
in 1
elaborate 1
smoking 1
suits 1
were 1
handing 1
tea 1
cakes 1
to 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
women 1
The 1
house 1
party 1
consisted 1
of 1
twelve 1
people 1
and 1
there 1
were 1
more 1
expected 1
to 1
arrive 1
on 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
What 1
are 1
you 1
two 1
talking 1
about 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
strolling 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
putting 1
his 1
cup 1
down 1
I 1
hope 1
Dorian 1
has 1
told 1
you 1
about 1
my 1
plan 1
for 1
rechristening 1
everything 1
Gladys 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
delightful 1
idea 1
But 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
rechristened 1
Harry 1
rejoined 1
the 1
duchess 1
looking 1
up 1
at 1
him 1
with 1
her 1
wonderful 1
eyes 1
I 1
am 1
quite 1
satisfied 1
with 1
my 1
own 1
name 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
should 1
be 1
satisfied 1
with 1
his 1
My 1
dear 1
Gladys 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
alter 1
either 1
name 1
for 1
the 1
world 1
They 1
are 1
both 1
perfect 1
I 1
was 1
thinking 1
chiefly 1
of 1
flowers 1
Yesterday 1
I 1
cut 1
an 1
orchid 1
for 1
my 1
button 1
hole 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
marvellous 1
spotted 1
thing 1
as 1
effective 1
as 1
the 1
seven 1
deadly 1
sins 1
In 1
a 1
thoughtless 1
moment 1
I 1
asked 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
gardeners 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
called 1
He 1
told 1
me 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
fine 1
specimen 1
of 1
Robinsoniana 1
or 1
something 1
dreadful 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
sad 1
truth 1
but 1
we 1
have 1
lost 1
the 1
faculty 1
of 1
giving 1
lovely 1
names 1
to 1
things 1
Names 1
are 1
everything 1
I 1
never 1
quarrel 1
with 1
actions 1
My 1
one 1
quarrel 1
is 1
with 1
words 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
reason 1
I 1
hate 1
vulgar 1
realism 1
in 1
literature 1
The 1
man 1
who 1
could 1
call 1
a 1
spade 1
a 1
spade 1
should 1
be 1
compelled 1
to 1
use 1
one 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
he 1
is 1
fit 1
for 1
Then 1
what 1
should 1
we 1
call 1
you 1
Harry 1
she 1
asked 1
His 1
name 1
is 1
Prince 1
Paradox 1
said 1
Dorian 1
I 1
recognize 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
flash 1
exclaimed 1
the 1
duchess 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
hear 1
of 1
it 1
laughed 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
sinking 1
into 1
a 1
chair 1
From 1
a 1
label 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
escape 1
I 1
refuse 1
the 1
title 1
Royalties 1
may 1
not 1
abdicate 1
fell 1
as 1
a 1
warning 1
from 1
pretty 1
lips 1
You 1
wish 1
me 1
to 1
defend 1
my 1
throne 1
then 1
Yes 1
I 1
give 1
the 1
truths 1
of 1
to 1
morrow 1
I 1
prefer 1
the 1
mistakes 1
of 1
to 1
day 1
she 1
answered 1
You 1
disarm 1
me 1
Gladys 1
he 1
cried 1
catching 1
the 1
wilfulness 1
of 1
her 1
mood 1
Of 1
your 1
shield 1
Harry 1
not 1
of 1
your 1
spear 1
I 1
never 1
tilt 1
against 1
beauty 1
he 1
said 1
with 1
a 1
wave 1
of 1
his 1
hand 1
That 1
is 1
your 1
error 1
Harry 1
believe 1
me 1
You 1
value 1
beauty 1
far 1
too 1
much 1
How 1
can 1
you 1
say 1
that 1
I 1
admit 1
that 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
better 1
to 1
be 1
beautiful 1
than 1
to 1
be 1
good 1
But 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
no 1
one 1
is 1
more 1
ready 1
than 1
I 1
am 1
to 1
acknowledge 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
better 1
to 1
be 1
good 1
than 1
to 1
be 1
ugly 1
Ugliness 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
seven 1
deadly 1
sins 1
then 1
cried 1
the 1
duchess 1
What 1
becomes 1
of 1
your 1
simile 1
about 1
the 1
orchid 1
Ugliness 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
seven 1
deadly 1
virtues 1
Gladys 1
You 1
as 1
a 1
good 1
Tory 1
must 1
not 1
underrate 1
them 1
Beer 1
the 1
Bible 1
and 1
the 1
seven 1
deadly 1
virtues 1
have 1
made 1
our 1
England 1
what 1
she 1
is 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
your 1
country 1
then 1
she 1
asked 1
I 1
live 1
in 1
it 1
That 1
you 1
may 1
censure 1
it 1
the 1
better 1
Would 1
you 1
have 1
me 1
take 1
the 1
verdict 1
of 1
Europe 1
on 1
it 1
he 1
inquired 1
What 1
do 1
they 1
say 1
of 1
us 1
That 1
Tartuffe 1
has 1
emigrated 1
to 1
England 1
and 1
opened 1
a 1
shop 1
Is 1
that 1
yours 1
Harry 1
I 1
give 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
use 1
it 1
It 1
is 1
too 1
true 1
You 1
need 1
not 1
be 1
afraid 1
Our 1
countrymen 1
never 1
recognize 1
a 1
description 1
They 1
are 1
practical 1
They 1
are 1
more 1
cunning 1
than 1
practical 1
When 1
they 1
make 1
up 1
their 1
ledger 1
they 1
balance 1
stupidity 1
by 1
wealth 1
and 1
vice 1
by 1
hypocrisy 1
Still 1
we 1
have 1
done 1
great 1
things 1
Great 1
things 1
have 1
been 1
thrust 1
on 1
us 1
Gladys 1
We 1
have 1
carried 1
their 1
burden 1
Only 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
the 1
Stock 1
Exchange 1
She 1
shook 1
her 1
head 1
I 1
believe 1
in 1
the 1
race 1
she 1
cried 1
It 1
represents 1
the 1
survival 1
of 1
the 1
pushing 1
It 1
has 1
development 1
Decay 1
fascinates 1
me 1
more 1
What 1
of 1
art 1
she 1
asked 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
malady 1
Love 1
An 1
illusion 1
Religion 1
The 1
fashionable 1
substitute 1
for 1
belief 1
You 1
are 1
a 1
sceptic 1
Never 1
Scepticism 1
is 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
faith 1
What 1
are 1
you 1
To 1
define 1
is 1
to 1
limit 1
Give 1
me 1
a 1
clue 1
Threads 1
snap 1
You 1
would 1
lose 1
your 1
way 1
in 1
the 1
labyrinth 1
You 1
bewilder 1
me 1
Let 1
us 1
talk 1
of 1
some 1
one 1
else 1
Our 1
host 1
is 1
a 1
delightful 1
topic 1
Years 1
ago 1
he 1
was 1
christened 1
Prince 1
Charming 1
Ah 1
don 1
t 1
remind 1
me 1
of 1
that 1
cried 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
Our 1
host 1
is 1
rather 1
horrid 1
this 1
evening 1
answered 1
the 1
duchess 1
colouring 1
I 1
believe 1
he 1
thinks 1
that 1
Monmouth 1
married 1
me 1
on 1
purely 1
scientific 1
principles 1
as 1
the 1
best 1
specimen 1
he 1
could 1
find 1
of 1
a 1
modern 1
butterfly 1
Well 1
I 1
hope 1
he 1
won 1
t 1
stick 1
pins 1
into 1
you 1
Duchess 1
laughed 1
Dorian 1
Oh 1
my 1
maid 1
does 1
that 1
already 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
when 1
she 1
is 1
annoyed 1
with 1
me 1
And 1
what 1
does 1
she 1
get 1
annoyed 1
with 1
you 1
about 1
Duchess 1
For 1
the 1
most 1
trivial 1
things 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
I 1
assure 1
you 1
Usually 1
because 1
I 1
come 1
in 1
at 1
ten 1
minutes 1
to 1
nine 1
and 1
tell 1
her 1
that 1
I 1
must 1
be 1
dressed 1
by 1
half 1
past 1
eight 1
How 1
unreasonable 1
of 1
her 1
You 1
should 1
give 1
her 1
warning 1
I 1
daren 1
t 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
Why 1
she 1
invents 1
hats 1
for 1
me 1
You 1
remember 1
the 1
one 1
I 1
wore 1
at 1
Lady 1
Hilstone 1
s 1
garden 1
party 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
nice 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
pretend 1
that 1
you 1
do 1
Well 1
she 1
made 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
nothing 1
All 1
good 1
hats 1
are 1
made 1
out 1
of 1
nothing 1
Like 1
all 1
good 1
reputations 1
Gladys 1
interrupted 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Every 1
effect 1
that 1
one 1
produces 1
gives 1
one 1
an 1
enemy 1
To 1
be 1
popular 1
one 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
mediocrity 1
Not 1
with 1
women 1
said 1
the 1
duchess 1
shaking 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
women 1
rule 1
the 1
world 1
I 1
assure 1
you 1
we 1
can 1
t 1
bear 1
mediocrities 1
We 1
women 1
as 1
some 1
one 1
says 1
love 1
with 1
our 1
ears 1
just 1
as 1
you 1
men 1
love 1
with 1
your 1
eyes 1
if 1
you 1
ever 1
love 1
at 1
all 1
It 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
we 1
never 1
do 1
anything 1
else 1
murmured 1
Dorian 1
Ah 1
then 1
you 1
never 1
really 1
love 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
answered 1
the 1
duchess 1
with 1
mock 1
sadness 1
My 1
dear 1
Gladys 1
cried 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
How 1
can 1
you 1
say 1
that 1
Romance 1
lives 1
by 1
repetition 1
and 1
repetition 1
converts 1
an 1
appetite 1
into 1
an 1
art 1
Besides 1
each 1
time 1
that 1
one 1
loves 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
time 1
one 1
has 1
ever 1
loved 1
Difference 1
of 1
object 1
does 1
not 1
alter 1
singleness 1
of 1
passion 1
It 1
merely 1
intensifies 1
it 1
We 1
can 1
have 1
in 1
life 1
but 1
one 1
great 1
experience 1
at 1
best 1
and 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
life 1
is 1
to 1
reproduce 1
that 1
experience 1
as 1
often 1
as 1
possible 1
Even 1
when 1
one 1
has 1
been 1
wounded 1
by 1
it 1
Harry 1
asked 1
the 1
duchess 1
after 1
a 1
pause 1
Especially 1
when 1
one 1
has 1
been 1
wounded 1
by 1
it 1
answered 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
The 1
duchess 1
turned 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
with 1
a 1
curious 1
expression 1
in 1
her 1
eyes 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
say 1
to 1
that 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
she 1
inquired 1
Dorian 1
hesitated 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
Then 1
he 1
threw 1
his 1
head 1
back 1
and 1
laughed 1
I 1
always 1
agree 1
with 1
Harry 1
Duchess 1
Even 1
when 1
he 1
is 1
wrong 1
Harry 1
is 1
never 1
wrong 1
Duchess 1
And 1
does 1
his 1
philosophy 1
make 1
you 1
happy 1
I 1
have 1
never 1
searched 1
for 1
happiness 1
Who 1
wants 1
happiness 1
I 1
have 1
searched 1
for 1
pleasure 1
And 1
found 1
it 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
Often 1
Too 1
often 1
The 1
duchess 1
sighed 1
I 1
am 1
searching 1
for 1
peace 1
she 1
said 1
and 1
if 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
go 1
and 1
dress 1
I 1
shall 1
have 1
none 1
this 1
evening 1
Let 1
me 1
get 1
you 1
some 1
orchids 1
Duchess 1
cried 1
Dorian 1
starting 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
and 1
walking 1
down 1
the 1
conservatory 1
You 1
are 1
flirting 1
disgracefully 1
with 1
him 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
to 1
his 1
cousin 1
You 1
had 1
better 1
take 1
care 1
He 1
is 1
very 1
fascinating 1
If 1
he 1
were 1
not 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
no 1
battle 1
Greek 1
meets 1
Greek 1
then 1
I 1
am 1
on 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
Trojans 1
They 1
fought 1
for 1
a 1
woman 1
They 1
were 1
defeated 1
There 1
are 1
worse 1
things 1
than 1
capture 1
she 1
answered 1
You 1
gallop 1
with 1
a 1
loose 1
rein 1
Pace 1
gives 1
life 1
was 1
the 1
riposte 1
I 1
shall 1
write 1
it 1
in 1
my 1
diary 1
to 1
night 1
What 1
That 1
a 1
burnt 1
child 1
loves 1
the 1
fire 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
even 1
singed 1
My 1
wings 1
are 1
untouched 1
You 1
use 1
them 1
for 1
everything 1
except 1
flight 1
Courage 1
has 1
passed 1
from 1
men 1
to 1
women 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
new 1
experience 1
for 1
us 1
You 1
have 1
a 1
rival 1
Who 1
He 1
laughed 1
Lady 1
Narborough 1
he 1
whispered 1
She 1
perfectly 1
adores 1
him 1
You 1
fill 1
me 1
with 1
apprehension 1
The 1
appeal 1
to 1
antiquity 1
is 1
fatal 1
to 1
us 1
who 1
are 1
romanticists 1
Romanticists 1
You 1
have 1
all 1
the 1
methods 1
of 1
science 1
Men 1
have 1
educated 1
us 1
But 1
not 1
explained 1
you 1
Describe 1
us 1
as 1
a 1
sex 1
was 1
her 1
challenge 1
Sphinxes 1
without 1
secrets 1
She 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
smiling 1
How 1
long 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
is 1
she 1
said 1
Let 1
us 1
go 1
and 1
help 1
him 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
yet 1
told 1
him 1
the 1
colour 1
of 1
my 1
frock 1
Ah 1
you 1
must 1
suit 1
your 1
frock 1
to 1
his 1
flowers 1
Gladys 1
That 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
premature 1
surrender 1
Romantic 1
art 1
begins 1
with 1
its 1
climax 1
I 1
must 1
keep 1
an 1
opportunity 1
for 1
retreat 1
In 1
the 1
Parthian 1
manner 1
They 1
found 1
safety 1
in 1
the 1
desert 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
do 1
that 1
Women 1
are 1
not 1
always 1
allowed 1
a 1
choice 1
he 1
answered 1
but 1
hardly 1
had 1
he 1
finished 1
the 1
sentence 1
before 1
from 1
the 1
far 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
conservatory 1
came 1
a 1
stifled 1
groan 1
followed 1
by 1
the 1
dull 1
sound 1
of 1
a 1
heavy 1
fall 1
Everybody 1
started 1
up 1
The 1
duchess 1
stood 1
motionless 1
in 1
horror 1
And 1
with 1
fear 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
rushed 1
through 1
the 1
flapping 1
palms 1
to 1
find 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
lying 1
face 1
downwards 1
on 1
the 1
tiled 1
floor 1
in 1
a 1
deathlike 1
swoon 1
He 1
was 1
carried 1
at 1
once 1
into 1
the 1
blue 1
drawing 1
room 1
and 1
laid 1
upon 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
sofas 1
After 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
himself 1
and 1
looked 1
round 1
with 1
a 1
dazed 1
expression 1
What 1
has 1
happened 1
he 1
asked 1
Oh 1
I 1
remember 1
Am 1
I 1
safe 1
here 1
Harry 1
He 1
began 1
to 1
tremble 1
My 1
dear 1
Dorian 1
answered 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
you 1
merely 1
fainted 1
That 1
was 1
all 1
You 1
must 1
have 1
overtired 1
yourself 1
You 1
had 1
better 1
not 1
come 1
down 1
to 1
dinner 1
I 1
will 1
take 1
your 1
place 1
No 1
I 1
will 1
come 1
down 1
he 1
said 1
struggling 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
I 1
would 1
rather 1
come 1
down 1
I 1
must 1
not 1
be 1
alone 1
He 1
went 1
to 1
his 1
room 1
and 1
dressed 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
wild 1
recklessness 1
of 1
gaiety 1
in 1
his 1
manner 1
as 1
he 1
sat 1
at 1
table 1
but 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
thrill 1
of 1
terror 1
ran 1
through 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
remembered 1
that 1
pressed 1
against 1
the 1
window 1
of 1
the 1
conservatory 1
like 1
a 1
white 1
handkerchief 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
James 1
Vane 1
watching 1
him 1
CHAPTER 1
The 1
next 1
day 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
leave 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
indeed 1
spent 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
room 1
sick 1
with 1
a 1
wild 1
terror 1
of 1
dying 1
and 1
yet 1
indifferent 1
to 1
life 1
itself 1
The 1
consciousness 1
of 1
being 1
hunted 1
snared 1
tracked 1
down 1
had 1
begun 1
to 1
dominate 1
him 1
If 1
the 1
tapestry 1
did 1
but 1
tremble 1
in 1
the 1
wind 1
he 1
shook 1
The 1
dead 1
leaves 1
that 1
were 1
blown 1
against 1
the 1
leaded 1
panes 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
like 1
his 1
own 1
wasted 1
resolutions 1
and 1
wild 1
regrets 1
When 1
he 1
closed 1
his 1
eyes 1
he 1
saw 1
again 1
the 1
sailor 1
s 1
face 1
peering 1
through 1
the 1
mist 1
stained 1
glass 1
and 1
horror 1
seemed 1
once 1
more 1
to 1
lay 1
its 1
hand 1
upon 1
his 1
heart 1
But 1
perhaps 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
only 1
his 1
fancy 1
that 1
had 1
called 1
vengeance 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
and 1
set 1
the 1
hideous 1
shapes 1
of 1
punishment 1
before 1
him 1
Actual 1
life 1
was 1
chaos 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
terribly 1
logical 1
in 1
the 1
imagination 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
imagination 1
that 1
set 1
remorse 1
to 1
dog 1
the 1
feet 1
of 1
sin 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
imagination 1
that 1
made 1
each 1
crime 1
bear 1
its 1
misshapen 1
brood 1
In 1
the 1
common 1
world 1
of 1
fact 1
the 1
wicked 1
were 1
not 1
punished 1
nor 1
the 1
good 1
rewarded 1
Success 1
was 1
given 1
to 1
the 1
strong 1
failure 1
thrust 1
upon 1
the 1
weak 1
That 1
was 1
all 1
Besides 1
had 1
any 1
stranger 1
been 1
prowling 1
round 1
the 1
house 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
seen 1
by 1
the 1
servants 1
or 1
the 1
keepers 1
Had 1
any 1
foot 1
marks 1
been 1
found 1
on 1
the 1
flower 1
beds 1
the 1
gardeners 1
would 1
have 1
reported 1
it 1
Yes 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
merely 1
fancy 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
s 1
brother 1
had 1
not 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
kill 1
him 1
He 1
had 1
sailed 1
away 1
in 1
his 1
ship 1
to 1
founder 1
in 1
some 1
winter 1
sea 1
From 1
him 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
he 1
was 1
safe 1
Why 1
the 1
man 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
who 1
he 1
was 1
could 1
not 1
know 1
who 1
he 1
was 1
The 1
mask 1
of 1
youth 1
had 1
saved 1
him 1
And 1
yet 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
merely 1
an 1
illusion 1
how 1
terrible 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
conscience 1
could 1
raise 1
such 1
fearful 1
phantoms 1
and 1
give 1
them 1
visible 1
form 1
and 1
make 1
them 1
move 1
before 1
one 1
What 1
sort 1
of 1
life 1
would 1
his 1
be 1
if 1
day 1
and 1
night 1
shadows 1
of 1
his 1
crime 1
were 1
to 1
peer 1
at 1
him 1
from 1
silent 1
corners 1
to 1
mock 1
him 1
from 1
secret 1
places 1
to 1
whisper 1
in 1
his 1
ear 1
as 1
he 1
sat 1
at 1
the 1
feast 1
to 1
wake 1
him 1
with 1
icy 1
fingers 1
as 1
he 1
lay 1
asleep 1
As 1
the 1
thought 1
crept 1
through 1
his 1
brain 1
he 1
grew 1
pale 1
with 1
terror 1
and 1
the 1
air 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
have 1
become 1
suddenly 1
colder 1
Oh 1
in 1
what 1
a 1
wild 1
hour 1
of 1
madness 1
he 1
had 1
killed 1
his 1
friend 1
How 1
ghastly 1
the 1
mere 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
scene 1
He 1
saw 1
it 1
all 1
again 1
Each 1
hideous 1
detail 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
him 1
with 1
added 1
horror 1
Out 1
of 1
the 1
black 1
cave 1
of 1
time 1
terrible 1
and 1
swathed 1
in 1
scarlet 1
rose 1
the 1
image 1
of 1
his 1
sin 1
When 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
came 1
in 1
at 1
six 1
o 1
clock 1
he 1
found 1
him 1
crying 1
as 1
one 1
whose 1
heart 1
will 1
break 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
till 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
that 1
he 1
ventured 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
There 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
the 1
clear 1
pine 1
scented 1
air 1
of 1
that 1
winter 1
morning 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
bring 1
him 1
back 1
his 1
joyousness 1
and 1
his 1
ardour 1
for 1
life 1
But 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
merely 1
the 1
physical 1
conditions 1
of 1
environment 1
that 1
had 1
caused 1
the 1
change 1
His 1
own 1
nature 1
had 1
revolted 1
against 1
the 1
excess 1
of 1
anguish 1
that 1
had 1
sought 1
to 1
maim 1
and 1
mar 1
the 1
perfection 1
of 1
its 1
calm 1
With 1
subtle 1
and 1
finely 1
wrought 1
temperaments 1
it 1
is 1
always 1
so 1
Their 1
strong 1
passions 1
must 1
either 1
bruise 1
or 1
bend 1
They 1
either 1
slay 1
the 1
man 1
or 1
themselves 1
die 1
Shallow 1
sorrows 1
and 1
shallow 1
loves 1
live 1
on 1
The 1
loves 1
and 1
sorrows 1
that 1
are 1
great 1
are 1
destroyed 1
by 1
their 1
own 1
plenitude 1
Besides 1
he 1
had 1
convinced 1
himself 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
victim 1
of 1
a 1
terror 1
stricken 1
imagination 1
and 1
looked 1
back 1
now 1
on 1
his 1
fears 1
with 1
something 1
of 1
pity 1
and 1
not 1
a 1
little 1
of 1
contempt 1
After 1
breakfast 1
he 1
walked 1
with 1
the 1
duchess 1
for 1
an 1
hour 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
then 1
drove 1
across 1
the 1
park 1
to 1
join 1
the 1
shooting 1
party 1
The 1
crisp 1
frost 1
lay 1
like 1
salt 1
upon 1
the 1
grass 1
The 1
sky 1
was 1
an 1
inverted 1
cup 1
of 1
blue 1
metal 1
A 1
thin 1
film 1
of 1
ice 1
bordered 1
the 1
flat 1
reed 1
grown 1
lake 1
At 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
pine 1
wood 1
he 1
caught 1
sight 1
of 1
Sir 1
Geoffrey 1
Clouston 1
the 1
duchess 1
s 1
brother 1
jerking 1
two 1
spent 1
cartridges 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
gun 1
He 1
jumped 1
from 1
the 1
cart 1
and 1
having 1
told 1
the 1
groom 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
mare 1
home 1
made 1
his 1
way 1
towards 1
his 1
guest 1
through 1
the 1
withered 1
bracken 1
and 1
rough 1
undergrowth 1
Have 1
you 1
had 1
good 1
sport 1
Geoffrey 1
he 1
asked 1
Not 1
very 1
good 1
Dorian 1
I 1
think 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
birds 1
have 1
gone 1
to 1
the 1
open 1
I 1
dare 1
say 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
better 1
after 1
lunch 1
when 1
we 1
get 1
to 1
new 1
ground 1
Dorian 1
strolled 1
along 1
by 1
his 1
side 1
The 1
keen 1
aromatic 1
air 1
the 1
brown 1
and 1
red 1
lights 1
that 1
glimmered 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
the 1
hoarse 1
cries 1
of 1
the 1
beaters 1
ringing 1
out 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
and 1
the 1
sharp 1
snaps 1
of 1
the 1
guns 1
that 1
followed 1
fascinated 1
him 1
and 1
filled 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
delightful 1
freedom 1
He 1
was 1
dominated 1
by 1
the 1
carelessness 1
of 1
happiness 1
by 1
the 1
high 1
indifference 1
of 1
joy 1
Suddenly 1
from 1
a 1
lumpy 1
tussock 1
of 1
old 1
grass 1
some 1
twenty 1
yards 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
them 1
with 1
black 1
tipped 1
ears 1
erect 1
and 1
long 1
hinder 1
limbs 1
throwing 1
it 1
forward 1
started 1
a 1
hare 1
It 1
bolted 1
for 1
a 1
thicket 1
of 1
alders 1
Sir 1
Geoffrey 1
put 1
his 1
gun 1
to 1
his 1
shoulder 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
the 1
animal 1
s 1
grace 1
of 1
movement 1
that 1
strangely 1
charmed 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
and 1
he 1
cried 1
out 1
at 1
once 1
Don 1
t 1
shoot 1
it 1
Geoffrey 1
Let 1
it 1
live 1
What 1
nonsense 1
Dorian 1
laughed 1
his 1
companion 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
hare 1
bounded 1
into 1
the 1
thicket 1
he 1
fired 1
There 1
were 1
two 1
cries 1
heard 1
the 1
cry 1
of 1
a 1
hare 1
in 1
pain 1
which 1
is 1
dreadful 1
the 1
cry 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
agony 1
which 1
is 1
worse 1
Good 1
heavens 1
I 1
have 1
hit 1
a 1
beater 1
exclaimed 1
Sir 1
Geoffrey 1
What 1
an 1
ass 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
to 1
get 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
guns 1
Stop 1
shooting 1
there 1
he 1
called 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
his 1
voice 1
A 1
man 1
is 1
hurt 1
The 1
head 1
keeper 1
came 1
running 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
stick 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
Where 1
sir 1
Where 1
is 1
he 2
shouted 1
At 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
the 1
firing 1
ceased 1
along 1
the 1
line 1
Here 1
answered 1
Sir 1
Geoffrey 1
angrily 1
hurrying 1
towards 1
the 1
thicket 1
Why 1
on 1
earth 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
keep 1
your 1
men 1
back 1
Spoiled 1
my 1
shooting 1
for 1
the 1
day 1
Dorian 1
watched 1
them 1
as 1
they 1
plunged 1
into 1
the 1
alder 1
clump 1
brushing 1
the 1
lithe 1
swinging 1
branches 1
aside 1
In 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
they 1
emerged 1
dragging 1
a 1
body 1
after 1
them 1
into 1
the 1
sunlight 1
He 1
turned 1
away 1
in 1
horror 1
It 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
misfortune 1
followed 1
wherever 1
he 1
went 1
He 1
heard 1
Sir 1
Geoffrey 1
ask 1
if 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
really 1
dead 1
and 1
the 1
affirmative 1
answer 1
of 1
the 1
keeper 1
The 1
wood 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
have 1
become 1
suddenly 1
alive 1
with 1
faces 1
There 1
was 1
the 1
trampling 1
of 1
myriad 1
feet 1
and 1
the 1
low 1
buzz 1
of 1
voices 1
A 1
great 1
copper 1
breasted 1
pheasant 1
came 1
beating 1
through 1
the 1
boughs 1
overhead 1
After 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
that 1
were 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
perturbed 1
state 1
like 1
endless 1
hours 1
of 1
pain 1
he 1
felt 1
a 1
hand 1
laid 1
on 1
his 1
shoulder 1
He 1
started 1
and 1
looked 1
round 1
Dorian 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
I 1
had 1
better 1
tell 1
them 1
that 1
the 1
shooting 1
is 1
stopped 1
for 1
to 1
day 1
It 1
would 1
not 1
look 1
well 1
to 1
go 1
on 1
I 1
wish 1
it 1
were 1
stopped 1
for 1
ever 1
Harry 1
he 1
answered 1
bitterly 1
The 1
whole 1
thing 1
is 1
hideous 1
and 1
cruel 1
Is 1
the 1
man 1
He 1
could 1
not 1
finish 1
the 1
sentence 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
so 1
rejoined 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
He 1
got 1
the 1
whole 1
charge 1
of 1
shot 1
in 1
his 1
chest 1
He 1
must 1
have 1
died 1
almost 1
instantaneously 1
Come 1
let 1
us 1
go 1
home 1
They 1
walked 1
side 1
by 1
side 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
avenue 1
for 1
nearly 1
fifty 1
yards 1
without 1
speaking 1
Then 1
Dorian 1
looked 1
at 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
and 1
said 1
with 1
a 1
heavy 1
sigh 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
bad 1
omen 1
Harry 1
a 1
very 1
bad 1
omen 1
What 1
is 1
asked 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
Oh 1
this 1
accident 1
I 1
suppose 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
it 1
can 1
t 1
be 1
helped 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
own 1
fault 1
Why 1
did 1
he 1
get 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
guns 1
Besides 1
it 1
is 1
nothing 1
to 1
us 1
It 1
is 1
rather 1
awkward 1
for 1
Geoffrey 1
of 1
course 1
It 1
does 1
not 1
do 1
to 1
pepper 1
beaters 1
It 1
makes 1
people 1
think 1
that 1
one 1
is 1
a 1
wild 1
shot 1
And 1
Geoffrey 1
is 1
not 1
he 1
shoots 1
very 1
straight 1
But 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
use 1
talking 1
about 1
the 1
matter 1
Dorian 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
bad 1
omen 1
Harry 1
I 1
feel 1
as 1
if 1
something 1
horrible 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
happen 1
to 1
some 1
of 1
us 1
To 1
myself 1
perhaps 1
he 1
added 1
passing 1
his 1
hand 1
over 1
his 1
eyes 1
with 1
a 1
gesture 1
of 1
pain 1
The 1
elder 1
man 1
laughed 1
The 1
only 1
horrible 1
thing 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
is 1
ennui 1
Dorian 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
one 1
sin 1
for 1
which 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
forgiveness 1
But 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
likely 1
to 1
suffer 1
from 1
it 1
unless 1
these 1
fellows 1
keep 1
chattering 1
about 1
this 1
thing 1
at 1
dinner 1
I 1
must 1
tell 1
them 1
that 1
the 1
subject 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
tabooed 1
As 1
for 1
omens 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
such 1
thing 1
as 1
an 1
omen 1
Destiny 1
does 1
not 1
send 1
us 1
heralds 1
She 1
is 1
too 1
wise 1
or 1
too 1
cruel 1
for 1
that 1
Besides 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
could 1
happen 1
to 1
you 1
Dorian 1
You 1
have 1
everything 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
that 1
a 1
man 1
can 1
want 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
one 1
who 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
delighted 1
to 1
change 1
places 1
with 1
you 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
one 1
with 1
whom 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
change 1
places 1
Harry 1
Don 1
t 1
laugh 1
like 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
telling 1
you 1
the 1
truth 1
The 1
wretched 1
peasant 1
who 1
has 1
just 1
died 1
is 1
better 1
off 1
than 1
I 1
am 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
terror 1
of 1
death 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
coming 1
of 1
death 1
that 1
terrifies 1
me 1
Its 1
monstrous 1
wings 1
seem 1
to 1
wheel 1
in 1
the 1
leaden 1
air 1
around 1
me 1
Good 1
heavens 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
see 1
a 1
man 1
moving 1
behind 1
the 1
trees 1
there 1
watching 1
me 1
waiting 1
for 1
me 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
looked 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
trembling 1
gloved 1
hand 1
was 1
pointing 1
Yes 1
he 1
said 1
smiling 1
I 1
see 1
the 1
gardener 1
waiting 1
for 1
you 1
I 1
suppose 1
he 1
wants 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
what 1
flowers 1
you 1
wish 1
to 1
have 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
to 1
night 1
How 1
absurdly 1
nervous 1
you 1
are 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
You 1
must 1
come 1
and 1
see 1
my 1
doctor 1
when 1
we 1
get 1
back 1
to 1
town 1
Dorian 1
heaved 1
a 1
sigh 1
of 1
relief 1
as 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
gardener 1
approaching 1
The 1
man 1
touched 1
his 1
hat 1
glanced 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
at 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
in 1
a 1
hesitating 1
manner 1
and 1
then 1
produced 1
a 1
letter 1
which 1
he 1
handed 1
to 1
his 1
master 1
Her 1
Grace 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
wait 1
for 1
an 1
answer 1
he 1
murmured 1
Dorian 1
put 1
the 1
letter 1
into 1
his 1
pocket 1
Tell 1
her 1
Grace 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
coming 1
in 1
he 1
said 1
coldly 1
The 1
man 1
turned 1
round 1
and 1
went 1
rapidly 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
How 1
fond 1
women 1
are 1
of 1
doing 1
dangerous 1
things 1
laughed 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
It 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
qualities 1
in 1
them 1
that 1
I 1
admire 1
most 1
A 1
woman 1
will 1
flirt 1
with 1
anybody 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
other 1
people 1
are 1
looking 1
on 1
How 1
fond 1
you 1
are 1
of 1
saying 1
dangerous 1
things 1
Harry 1
In 1
the 1
present 1
instance 1
you 1
are 1
quite 1
astray 1
I 1
like 1
the 1
duchess 1
very 1
much 1
but 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
love 1
her 1
And 1
the 1
duchess 1
loves 1
you 1
very 1
much 1
but 1
she 1
likes 1
you 1
less 1
so 1
you 1
are 1
excellently 1
matched 1
You 1
are 1
talking 1
scandal 1
Harry 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
never 1
any 1
basis 1
for 1
scandal 1
The 1
basis 1
of 1
every 1
scandal 1
is 1
an 1
immoral 1
certainty 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
lighting 1
a 1
cigarette 1
You 1
would 1
sacrifice 1
anybody 1
Harry 1
for 1
the 1
sake 1
of 1
an 1
epigram 1
The 1
world 1
goes 1
to 1
the 1
altar 1
of 1
its 1
own 1
accord 1
was 1
the 1
answer 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
could 1
love 1
cried 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
with 1
a 1
deep 1
note 1
of 1
pathos 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
But 1
I 1
seem 1
to 1
have 1
lost 1
the 1
passion 1
and 1
forgotten 1
the 1
desire 1
I 1
am 1
too 1
much 1
concentrated 1
on 1
myself 1
My 1
own 1
personality 1
has 1
become 1
a 1
burden 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
escape 1
to 1
go 1
away 1
to 1
forget 1
It 1
was 1
silly 1
of 1
me 1
to 1
come 1
down 1
here 1
at 1
all 1
I 1
think 1
I 1
shall 1
send 1
a 1
wire 1
to 1
Harvey 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
yacht 1
got 1
ready 1
On 1
a 1
yacht 1
one 1
is 1
safe 1
Safe 1
from 1
what 1
Dorian 1
You 1
are 1
in 1
some 1
trouble 1
Why 1
not 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
You 1
know 1
I 1
would 1
help 1
you 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
tell 1
you 1
Harry 1
he 1
answered 1
sadly 1
And 1
I 1
dare 1
say 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
a 1
fancy 1
of 1
mine 1
This 1
unfortunate 1
accident 1
has 1
upset 1
me 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
horrible 1
presentiment 1
that 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
may 1
happen 1
to 1
me 1
What 1
nonsense 1
I 1
hope 1
it 1
is 1
but 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
help 1
feeling 1
it 1
Ah 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
duchess 1
looking 1
like 1
Artemis 1
in 1
a 1
tailor 1
made 1
gown 1
You 1
see 1
we 1
have 1
come 1
back 1
Duchess 1
I 1
have 1
heard 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
she 1
answered 1
Poor 1
Geoffrey 1
is 1
terribly 1
upset 1
And 1
it 1
seems 1
that 1
you 1
asked 1
him 1
not 1
to 1
shoot 1
the 1
hare 1
How 1
curious 1
Yes 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
curious 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
made 1
me 1
say 1
it 1
Some 1
whim 1
I 1
suppose 1
It 1
looked 1
the 1
loveliest 1
of 1
little 1
live 1
things 1
But 1
I 1
am 1
sorry 1
they 1
told 1
you 1
about 1
the 1
man 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
hideous 1
subject 1
It 1
is 1
an 1
annoying 1
subject 1
broke 1
in 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
It 1
has 1
no 1
psychological 1
value 1
at 1
all 1
Now 1
if 1
Geoffrey 1
had 1
done 1
the 1
thing 1
on 1
purpose 1
how 1
interesting 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
know 1
some 1
one 1
who 1
had 1
committed 1
a 1
real 1
murder 1
How 1
horrid 1
of 1
you 1
Harry 1
cried 1
the 1
duchess 1
Isn 1
t 1
it 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
Harry 1
Mr 1
Gray 1
is 1
ill 1
again 1
He 1
is 1
going 1
to 1
faint 1
Dorian 1
drew 1
himself 1
up 1
with 1
an 1
effort 1
and 1
smiled 1
It 1
is 1
nothing 1
Duchess 1
he 1
murmured 1
my 1
nerves 1
are 1
dreadfully 1
out 1
of 1
order 1
That 1
is 1
all 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
I 1
walked 1
too 1
far 1
this 1
morning 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
hear 1
what 1
Harry 1
said 1
Was 1
it 1
very 1
bad 1
You 1
must 1
tell 1
me 1
some 1
other 1
time 1
I 1
think 1
I 1
must 1
go 1
and 1
lie 1
down 1
You 1
will 1
excuse 1
me 1
won 1
t 1
you 1
They 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
great 1
flight 1
of 1
steps 1
that 1
led 1
from 1
the 1
conservatory 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
terrace 1
As 1
the 1
glass 1
door 1
closed 1
behind 1
Dorian 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
turned 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
duchess 1
with 1
his 1
slumberous 1
eyes 1
Are 1
you 1
very 1
much 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
him 1
he 1
asked 1
She 1
did 1
not 1
answer 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
but 1
stood 1
gazing 1
at 1
the 1
landscape 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
knew 1
she 1
said 1
at 1
last 1
He 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
Knowledge 1
would 1
be 1
fatal 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
uncertainty 1
that 1
charms 1
one 1
A 1
mist 1
makes 1
things 1
wonderful 1
One 1
may 1
lose 1
one 1
s 1
way 1
All 1
ways 1
end 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
point 1
my 1
dear 1
Gladys 1
What 1
is 1
that 1
Disillusion 1
It 1
was 1
my 1
debut 1
in 1
life 1
she 1
sighed 1
It 1
came 1
to 1
you 1
crowned 1
I 1
am 1
tired 1
of 1
strawberry 1
leaves 1
They 1
become 1
you 1
Only 1
in 1
public 1
You 1
would 1
miss 1
them 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
part 1
with 1
a 1
petal 1
Monmouth 1
has 1
ears 1
Old 1
age 1
is 1
dull 1
of 1
hearing 1
Has 1
he 1
never 1
been 1
jealous 1
I 1
wish 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
He 1
glanced 1
about 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
something 1
What 1
are 1
you 1
looking 1
for 1
she 1
inquired 1
The 1
button 1
from 1
your 1
foil 1
he 1
answered 1
You 1
have 1
dropped 1
it 1
She 1
laughed 1
I 1
have 1
still 1
the 1
mask 1
It 1
makes 1
your 1
eyes 1
lovelier 1
was 1
his 1
reply 1
She 1
laughed 1
again 1
Her 1
teeth 1
showed 1
like 1
white 1
seeds 1
in 1
a 1
scarlet 1
fruit 1
Upstairs 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
room 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
was 1
lying 1
on 1
a 1
sofa 1
with 1
terror 1
in 1
every 1
tingling 1
fibre 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
Life 1
had 1
suddenly 1
become 1
too 1
hideous 1
a 1
burden 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
bear 1
The 1
dreadful 1
death 1
of 1
the 1
unlucky 1
beater 1
shot 1
in 1
the 1
thicket 1
like 1
a 1
wild 1
animal 1
had 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
pre 1
figure 1
death 1
for 1
himself 1
also 1
He 1
had 1
nearly 1
swooned 1
at 1
what 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
had 1
said 1
in 1
a 1
chance 1
mood 1
of 1
cynical 1
jesting 1
At 1
five 1
o 1
clock 1
he 1
rang 1
his 1
bell 1
for 1
his 1
servant 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
orders 1
to 1
pack 1
his 1
things 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
express 1
to 1
town 1
and 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
brougham 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
by 1
eight 1
thirty 1
He 1
was 1
determined 1
not 1
to 1
sleep 1
another 1
night 1
at 1
Selby 1
Royal 1
It 1
was 1
an 1
ill 1
omened 1
place 1
Death 1
walked 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
sunlight 1
The 1
grass 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
had 1
been 1
spotted 1
with 1
blood 1
Then 1
he 1
wrote 1
a 1
note 1
to 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
telling 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
up 1
to 1
town 1
to 1
consult 1
his 1
doctor 1
and 1
asking 1
him 1
to 1
entertain 1
his 1
guests 1
in 1
his 1
absence 1
As 1
he 1
was 1
putting 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
envelope 1
a 1
knock 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
his 1
valet 1
informed 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
head 1
keeper 1
wished 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
He 1
frowned 1
and 1
bit 1
his 1
lip 1
Send 1
him 1
in 1
he 1
muttered 1
after 1
some 1
moments 1
hesitation 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
man 1
entered 1
Dorian 1
pulled 1
his 1
chequebook 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
drawer 1
and 1
spread 1
it 1
out 1
before 1
him 1
I 1
suppose 1
you 1
have 1
come 1
about 1
the 1
unfortunate 1
accident 1
of 1
this 1
morning 1
Thornton 1
he 1
said 1
taking 1
up 1
a 1
pen 1
Yes 1
sir 1
answered 1
the 1
gamekeeper 1
Was 1
the 1
poor 1
fellow 1
married 1
Had 1
he 1
any 1
people 1
dependent 1
on 1
him 1
asked 1
Dorian 1
looking 1
bored 1
If 1
so 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
like 1
them 1
to 1
be 1
left 1
in 1
want 1
and 1
will 1
send 1
them 1
any 1
sum 1
of 1
money 1
you 1
may 1
think 1
necessary 1
We 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
who 1
he 1
is 1
sir 1
That 1
is 1
what 1
I 1
took 1
the 1
liberty 1
of 1
coming 1
to 1
you 1
about 1
Don 1
t 1
know 1
who 1
he 1
is 1
said 1
Dorian 1
listlessly 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
Wasn 1
t 1
he 1
one 1
of 1
your 1
men 1
No 1
sir 1
Never 1
saw 1
him 1
before 1
Seems 1
like 1
a 1
sailor 1
sir 1
The 1
pen 1
dropped 1
from 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
s 1
hand 1
and 1
he 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
his 1
heart 1
had 1
suddenly 1
stopped 1
beating 1
A 1
sailor 1
he 1
cried 1
out 1
Did 1
you 1
say 1
a 1
sailor 1
Yes 1
sir 1
He 1
looks 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
sailor 1
tattooed 1
on 1
both 1
arms 1
and 1
that 1
kind 1
of 1
thing 1
Was 1
there 1
anything 1
found 1
on 1
him 1
said 1
Dorian 1
leaning 1
forward 1
and 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
man 1
with 1
startled 1
eyes 1
Anything 1
that 1
would 1
tell 1
his 1
name 1
Some 1
money 1
sir 1
not 1
much 1
and 1
a 1
six 1
shooter 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
name 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
A 1
decent 1
looking 1
man 1
sir 1
but 1
rough 1
like 1
A 1
sort 1
of 1
sailor 1
we 1
think 1
Dorian 1
started 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
A 1
terrible 1
hope 1
fluttered 1
past 1
him 1
He 1
clutched 1
at 1
it 1
madly 1
Where 1
is 1
the 1
body 1
he 1
exclaimed 1
Quick 1
I 1
must 1
see 1
it 1
at 1
once 1
It 1
is 1
in 1
an 1
empty 1
stable 1
in 1
the 1
Home 1
Farm 1
sir 1
The 1
folk 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
to 1
have 1
that 1
sort 1
of 1
thing 1
in 1
their 1
houses 1
They 1
say 1
a 1
corpse 1
brings 1
bad 1
luck 1
The 1
Home 1
Farm 1
Go 1
there 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
meet 1
me 1
Tell 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
grooms 1
to 1
bring 1
my 1
horse 1
round 1
No 1
Never 1
mind 1
I 1
ll 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
stables 1
myself 1
It 1
will 1
save 1
time 1
In 1
less 1
than 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
was 1
galloping 1
down 1
the 1
long 1
avenue 1
as 1
hard 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
go 1
The 1
trees 1
seemed 1
to 1
sweep 1
past 1
him 1
in 1
spectral 1
procession 1
and 1
wild 1
shadows 1
to 1
fling 1
themselves 1
across 1
his 1
path 1
Once 1
the 1
mare 1
swerved 1
at 1
a 1
white 1
gate 1
post 1
and 1
nearly 1
threw 1
him 1
He 1
lashed 1
her 1
across 1
the 1
neck 1
with 1
his 1
crop 1
She 1
cleft 1
the 1
dusky 1
air 1
like 1
an 1
arrow 1
The 1
stones 1
flew 1
from 1
her 1
hoofs 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
reached 1
the 1
Home 1
Farm 1
Two 1
men 1
were 1
loitering 1
in 1
the 1
yard 1
He 1
leaped 1
from 1
the 1
saddle 1
and 1
threw 1
the 1
reins 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
In 1
the 1
farthest 1
stable 1
a 1
light 1
was 1
glimmering 1
Something 1
seemed 1
to 1
tell 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
body 1
was 1
there 1
and 1
he 1
hurried 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
the 1
latch 1
There 1
he 1
paused 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
feeling 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
brink 1
of 1
a 1
discovery 1
that 1
would 1
either 1
make 1
or 1
mar 1
his 1
life 1
Then 1
he 1
thrust 1
the 1
door 1
open 1
and 1
entered 1
On 1
a 1
heap 1
of 1
sacking 1
in 1
the 1
far 1
corner 1
was 1
lying 1
the 1
dead 1
body 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
dressed 1
in 1
a 1
coarse 1
shirt 1
and 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
blue 1
trousers 1
A 1
spotted 1
handkerchief 1
had 1
been 1
placed 1
over 1
the 1
face 1
A 1
coarse 1
candle 1
stuck 1
in 1
a 1
bottle 1
sputtered 1
beside 1
it 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
shuddered 1
He 1
felt 1
that 1
his 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
the 1
hand 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
handkerchief 1
away 1
and 1
called 1
out 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
farm 1
servants 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
him 1
Take 1
that 1
thing 1
off 1
the 1
face 1
I 1
wish 1
to 1
see 1
it 1
he 1
said 1
clutching 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
post 1
for 1
support 1
When 1
the 1
farm 1
servant 1
had 1
done 1
so 1
he 1
stepped 1
forward 1
A 1
cry 1
of 1
joy 1
broke 1
from 1
his 1
lips 1
The 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
shot 1
in 1
the 1
thicket 1
was 1
James 1
Vane 1
He 1
stood 1
there 1
for 1
some 1
minutes 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
dead 1
body 1
As 1
he 1
rode 1
home 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
full 1
of 1
tears 1
for 1
he 1
knew 1
he 1
was 1
safe 1
CHAPTER 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
use 1
your 1
telling 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
good 1
cried 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
dipping 1
his 1
white 1
fingers 1
into 1
a 1
red 1
copper 1
bowl 1
filled 1
with 1
rose 1
water 1
You 1
are 1
quite 1
perfect 1
Pray 1
don 1
t 1
change 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
No 1
Harry 1
I 1
have 1
done 1
too 1
many 1
dreadful 1
things 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
any 1
more 1
I 1
began 1
my 1
good 1
actions 1
yesterday 1
Where 1
were 1
you 1
yesterday 1
In 1
the 1
country 1
Harry 1
I 1
was 1
staying 1
at 1
a 1
little 1
inn 1
by 1
myself 1
My 1
dear 1
boy 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
smiling 1
anybody 1
can 1
be 1
good 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
There 1
are 1
no 1
temptations 1
there 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
reason 1
why 1
people 1
who 1
live 1
out 1
of 1
town 1
are 1
so 1
absolutely 1
uncivilized 1
Civilization 1
is 1
not 1
by 1
any 1
means 1
an 1
easy 1
thing 1
to 1
attain 1
to 1
There 1
are 1
only 1
two 1
ways 1
by 1
which 1
man 1
can 1
reach 1
it 1
One 1
is 1
by 1
being 1
cultured 1
the 1
other 1
by 1
being 1
corrupt 1
Country 1
people 1
have 1
no 1
opportunity 1
of 1
being 1
either 1
so 1
they 1
stagnate 1
Culture 1
and 1
corruption 1
echoed 1
Dorian 1
I 1
have 1
known 1
something 1
of 1
both 1
It 1
seems 1
terrible 1
to 1
me 1
now 1
that 1
they 1
should 1
ever 1
be 1
found 1
together 1
For 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
new 1
ideal 1
Harry 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
alter 1
I 1
think 1
I 1
have 1
altered 1
You 1
have 1
not 1
yet 1
told 1
me 1
what 1
your 1
good 1
action 1
was 1
Or 1
did 1
you 1
say 1
you 1
had 1
done 1
more 1
than 1
one 1
asked 1
his 1
companion 1
as 1
he 1
spilled 1
into 1
his 1
plate 1
a 1
little 1
crimson 1
pyramid 1
of 1
seeded 1
strawberries 1
and 1
through 1
a 1
perforated 1
shell 1
shaped 1
spoon 1
snowed 1
white 1
sugar 1
upon 1
them 1
I 1
can 1
tell 1
you 1
Harry 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
story 1
I 1
could 1
tell 1
to 1
any 1
one 1
else 1
I 1
spared 1
somebody 1
It 1
sounds 1
vain 1
but 1
you 1
understand 1
what 1
I 1
mean 1
She 1
was 1
quite 1
beautiful 1
and 1
wonderfully 1
like 1
Sibyl 1
Vane 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
which 1
first 1
attracted 1
me 1
to 1
her 1
You 1
remember 1
Sibyl 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
How 1
long 1
ago 1
that 1
seems 1
Well 1
Hetty 1
was 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
our 1
own 1
class 1
of 1
course 1
She 1
was 1
simply 1
a 1
girl 1
in 1
a 1
village 1
But 1
I 1
really 1
loved 1
her 1
I 1
am 1
quite 1
sure 1
that 1
I 1
loved 1
her 1
All 1
during 1
this 1
wonderful 1
May 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
having 1
I 1
used 1
to 1
run 1
down 1
and 1
see 1
her 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
times 1
a 1
week 1
Yesterday 1
she 1
met 1
me 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
orchard 1
The 1
apple 1
blossoms 1
kept 1
tumbling 1
down 1
on 1
her 1
hair 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
laughing 1
We 1
were 1
to 1
have 1
gone 1
away 1
together 1
this 1
morning 1
at 1
dawn 1
Suddenly 1
I 1
determined 1
to 1
leave 1
her 1
as 1
flowerlike 1
as 1
I 1
had 1
found 1
her 1
I 1
should 1
think 1
the 1
novelty 1
of 1
the 1
emotion 1
must 1
have 1
given 1
you 1
a 1
thrill 1
of 1
real 1
pleasure 1
Dorian 1
interrupted 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
But 1
I 1
can 1
finish 1
your 1
idyll 1
for 1
you 1
You 1
gave 1
her 1
good 1
advice 1
and 1
broke 1
her 1
heart 1
That 1
was 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
your 1
reformation 1
Harry 1
you 1
are 1
horrible 1
You 1
mustn 1
t 1
say 1
these 1
dreadful 1
things 1
Hetty 1
s 1
heart 1
is 1
not 1
broken 1
Of 1
course 1
she 1
cried 1
and 1
all 1
that 1
But 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
disgrace 1
upon 1
her 1
She 1
can 1
live 1
like 1
Perdita 1
in 1
her 1
garden 1
of 1
mint 1
and 1
marigold 1
And 1
weep 1
over 1
a 1
faithless 1
Florizel 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
laughing 1
as 1
he 1
leaned 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
My 1
dear 1
Dorian 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
most 1
curiously 1
boyish 1
moods 1
Do 1
you 1
think 1
this 1
girl 1
will 1
ever 1
be 1
really 1
content 1
now 1
with 1
any 1
one 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
rank 1
I 1
suppose 1
she 1
will 1
be 1
married 1
some 1
day 1
to 1
a 1
rough 1
carter 1
or 1
a 1
grinning 1
ploughman 1
Well 1
the 1
fact 1
of 1
having 1
met 1
you 1
and 1
loved 1
you 1
will 1
teach 1
her 1
to 1
despise 1
her 1
husband 1
and 1
she 1
will 1
be 1
wretched 1
From 1
a 1
moral 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
I 1
cannot 1
say 1
that 1
I 1
think 1
much 1
of 1
your 1
great 1
renunciation 1
Even 1
as 1
a 1
beginning 1
it 1
is 1
poor 1
Besides 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
that 1
Hetty 1
isn 1
t 1
floating 1
at 1
the 1
present 1
moment 1
in 1
some 1
starlit 1
mill 1
pond 1
with 1
lovely 1
water 1
lilies 1
round 1
her 1
like 1
Ophelia 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
bear 1
this 1
Harry 1
You 1
mock 1
at 1
everything 1
and 1
then 1
suggest 1
the 1
most 1
serious 1
tragedies 1
I 1
am 1
sorry 1
I 1
told 1
you 1
now 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
what 1
you 1
say 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
know 1
I 1
was 1
right 1
in 1
acting 1
as 1
I 1
did 1
Poor 1
Hetty 1
As 1
I 1
rode 1
past 1
the 1
farm 1
this 1
morning 1
I 1
saw 1
her 1
white 1
face 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
like 1
a 1
spray 1
of 1
jasmine 1
Don 1
t 1
let 1
us 1
talk 1
about 1
it 1
any 1
more 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
try 1
to 1
persuade 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
first 1
good 1
action 1
I 1
have 1
done 1
for 1
years 1
the 1
first 1
little 1
bit 1
of 1
self 1
sacrifice 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
known 1
is 1
really 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
sin 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
better 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
better 1
Tell 1
me 1
something 1
about 1
yourself 1
What 1
is 1
going 1
on 1
in 1
town 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
to 1
the 1
club 1
for 1
days 1
The 1
people 1
are 1
still 1
discussing 1
poor 1
Basil 1
s 1
disappearance 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
thought 1
they 1
had 1
got 1
tired 1
of 1
that 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
said 1
Dorian 1
pouring 1
himself 1
out 1
some 1
wine 1
and 1
frowning 1
slightly 1
My 1
dear 1
boy 1
they 1
have 1
only 1
been 1
talking 1
about 1
it 1
for 1
six 1
weeks 1
and 1
the 1
British 1
public 1
are 1
really 1
not 1
equal 1
to 1
the 1
mental 1
strain 1
of 1
having 1
more 1
than 1
one 1
topic 1
every 1
three 1
months 1
They 1
have 1
been 1
very 1
fortunate 1
lately 1
however 1
They 1
have 1
had 1
my 1
own 1
divorce 1
case 1
and 1
Alan 1
Campbell 1
s 1
suicide 1
Now 1
they 1
have 1
got 1
the 1
mysterious 1
disappearance 1
of 1
an 1
artist 1
Scotland 1
Yard 1
still 1
insists 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
grey 1
ulster 1
who 1
left 1
for 1
Paris 1
by 1
the 1
midnight 1
train 1
on 1
the 1
ninth 1
of 1
November 1
was 1
poor 1
Basil 1
and 1
the 1
French 1
police 1
declare 1
that 1
Basil 1
never 1
arrived 1
in 1
Paris 1
at 1
all 1
I 1
suppose 1
in 1
about 1
a 1
fortnight 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
told 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
seen 1
in 1
San 1
Francisco 1
It 1
is 1
an 1
odd 1
thing 1
but 1
every 1
one 1
who 1
disappears 1
is 1
said 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
at 1
San 1
Francisco 1
It 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
delightful 1
city 1
and 1
possess 1
all 1
the 1
attractions 1
of 1
the 1
next 1
world 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
has 1
happened 1
to 1
Basil 1
asked 1
Dorian 1
holding 1
up 1
his 1
Burgundy 1
against 1
the 1
light 1
and 1
wondering 1
how 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
discuss 1
the 1
matter 1
so 1
calmly 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
the 1
slightest 1
idea 1
If 1
Basil 1
chooses 1
to 1
hide 1
himself 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
business 1
of 1
mine 1
If 1
he 1
is 1
dead 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
think 1
about 1
him 1
Death 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
that 1
ever 1
terrifies 1
me 1
I 1
hate 1
it 1
Why 1
said 1
the 1
younger 1
man 1
wearily 1
Because 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
passing 1
beneath 1
his 1
nostrils 1
the 1
gilt 1
trellis 1
of 1
an 1
open 1
vinaigrette 1
box 1
one 1
can 1
survive 1
everything 1
nowadays 1
except 1
that 1
Death 1
and 1
vulgarity 1
are 1
the 1
only 1
two 1
facts 1
in 1
the 1
nineteenth 1
century 1
that 1
one 1
cannot 1
explain 1
away 1
Let 1
us 1
have 1
our 1
coffee 1
in 1
the 1
music 1
room 1
Dorian 1
You 1
must 1
play 1
Chopin 1
to 1
me 1
The 1
man 1
with 1
whom 1
my 1
wife 1
ran 1
away 1
played 1
Chopin 1
exquisitely 1
Poor 1
Victoria 1
I 1
was 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
her 1
The 1
house 1
is 1
rather 1
lonely 1
without 1
her 1
Of 1
course 1
married 1
life 1
is 1
merely 1
a 1
habit 1
a 1
bad 1
habit 1
But 1
then 1
one 1
regrets 1
the 1
loss 1
even 1
of 1
one 1
s 1
worst 1
habits 1
Perhaps 1
one 1
regrets 1
them 1
the 1
most 1
They 1
are 1
such 1
an 1
essential 1
part 1
of 1
one 1
s 1
personality 1
Dorian 1
said 1
nothing 1
but 1
rose 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
passing 1
into 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
piano 1
and 1
let 1
his 1
fingers 1
stray 1
across 1
the 1
white 1
and 1
black 1
ivory 1
of 1
the 1
keys 1
After 1
the 1
coffee 1
had 1
been 1
brought 1
in 1
he 1
stopped 1
and 1
looking 1
over 1
at 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
said 1
Harry 1
did 1
it 1
ever 1
occur 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
Basil 1
was 1
murdered 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
yawned 1
Basil 1
was 1
very 1
popular 1
and 1
always 1
wore 1
a 1
Waterbury 1
watch 1
Why 1
should 1
he 1
have 1
been 1
murdered 1
He 1
was 1
not 1
clever 1
enough 1
to 1
have 1
enemies 1
Of 1
course 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
wonderful 1
genius 1
for 1
painting 1
But 1
a 1
man 1
can 1
paint 1
like 1
Velasquez 1
and 1
yet 1
be 1
as 1
dull 1
as 1
possible 1
Basil 1
was 1
really 1
rather 1
dull 1
He 1
only 1
interested 1
me 1
once 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
when 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
years 1
ago 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
wild 1
adoration 1
for 1
you 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
the 1
dominant 1
motive 1
of 1
his 1
art 1
I 1
was 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
Basil 1
said 1
Dorian 1
with 1
a 1
note 1
of 1
sadness 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
But 1
don 1
t 1
people 1
say 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
murdered 1
Oh 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
papers 1
do 1
It 1
does 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
all 1
probable 1
I 1
know 1
there 1
are 1
dreadful 1
places 1
in 1
Paris 1
but 1
Basil 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
sort 1
of 1
man 1
to 1
have 1
gone 1
to 1
them 1
He 1
had 1
no 1
curiosity 1
It 1
was 1
his 1
chief 1
defect 1
What 1
would 1
you 1
say 1
Harry 1
if 1
I 1
told 1
you 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
murdered 1
Basil 1
said 1
the 1
younger 1
man 1
He 1
watched 1
him 1
intently 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
spoken 1
I 1
would 1
say 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
posing 1
for 1
a 1
character 1
that 1
doesn 1
t 1
suit 1
you 1
All 1
crime 1
is 1
vulgar 1
just 1
as 1
all 1
vulgarity 1
is 1
crime 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
in 1
you 1
Dorian 1
to 1
commit 1
a 1
murder 1
I 1
am 1
sorry 1
if 1
I 1
hurt 1
your 1
vanity 1
by 1
saying 1
so 1
but 1
I 1
assure 1
you 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
Crime 1
belongs 1
exclusively 1
to 1
the 1
lower 1
orders 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
blame 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
smallest 1
degree 1
I 1
should 1
fancy 1
that 1
crime 1
was 1
to 1
them 1
what 1
art 1
is 1
to 1
us 1
simply 1
a 1
method 1
of 1
procuring 1
extraordinary 1
sensations 1
A 1
method 1
of 1
procuring 1
sensations 1
Do 1
you 1
think 1
then 1
that 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
has 1
once 1
committed 1
a 1
murder 1
could 1
possibly 1
do 1
the 1
same 1
crime 1
again 1
Don 1
t 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
Oh 1
anything 1
becomes 1
a 1
pleasure 1
if 1
one 1
does 1
it 1
too 1
often 1
cried 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
laughing 1
That 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
important 1
secrets 1
of 1
life 1
I 1
should 1
fancy 1
however 1
that 1
murder 1
is 1
always 1
a 1
mistake 1
One 1
should 1
never 1
do 1
anything 1
that 1
one 1
cannot 1
talk 1
about 1
after 1
dinner 1
But 1
let 1
us 1
pass 1
from 1
poor 1
Basil 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
could 1
believe 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
such 1
a 1
really 1
romantic 1
end 1
as 1
you 1
suggest 1
but 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
I 1
dare 1
say 1
he 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
Seine 1
off 1
an 1
omnibus 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
conductor 1
hushed 1
up 1
the 1
scandal 1
Yes 1
I 1
should 1
fancy 1
that 1
was 1
his 1
end 1
I 1
see 1
him 1
lying 1
now 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
under 1
those 1
dull 1
green 1
waters 1
with 1
the 1
heavy 1
barges 1
floating 1
over 1
him 1
and 1
long 1
weeds 1
catching 1
in 1
his 1
hair 1
Do 1
you 1
know 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
done 1
much 1
more 1
good 1
work 1
During 1
the 1
last 1
ten 1
years 1
his 1
painting 1
had 1
gone 1
off 1
very 1
much 1
Dorian 1
heaved 1
a 1
sigh 1
and 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
strolled 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
stroke 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
a 1
curious 1
Java 1
parrot 1
a 1
large 1
grey 1
plumaged 1
bird 1
with 1
pink 1
crest 1
and 1
tail 1
that 1
was 1
balancing 1
itself 1
upon 1
a 1
bamboo 1
perch 1
As 1
his 1
pointed 1
fingers 1
touched 1
it 2
dropped 1
the 1
white 1
scurf 1
of 1
crinkled 1
lids 1
over 1
black 1
glasslike 1
eyes 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
sway 1
backwards 1
and 1
forwards 1
Yes 1
he 1
continued 1
turning 1
round 1
and 1
taking 1
his 1
handkerchief 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
pocket 1
his 1
painting 1
had 1
quite 1
gone 1
off 1
It 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
have 1
lost 1
something 1
It 1
had 1
lost 1
an 1
ideal 1
When 1
you 1
and 1
he 1
ceased 1
to 1
be 1
great 1
friends 1
he 1
ceased 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
great 1
artist 1
What 1
was 1
it 1
separated 1
you 1
I 1
suppose 1
he 1
bored 1
you 1
If 1
so 1
he 1
never 1
forgave 1
you 1
It 1
s 1
a 1
habit 1
bores 1
have 1
By 1
the 1
way 1
what 1
has 1
become 1
of 1
that 1
wonderful 1
portrait 1
he 1
did 1
of 1
you 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
seen 1
it 1
since 1
he 1
finished 1
it 1
Oh 1
I 1
remember 1
your 1
telling 1
me 1
years 1
ago 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
sent 1
it 1
down 1
to 1
Selby 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
got 1
mislaid 1
or 1
stolen 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
You 1
never 1
got 1
it 1
back 1
What 1
a 1
pity 1
it 1
was 1
really 1
a 1
masterpiece 1
I 1
remember 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
buy 1
it 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
had 1
now 1
It 1
belonged 1
to 1
Basil 1
s 1
best 1
period 1
Since 1
then 1
his 1
work 1
was 1
that 1
curious 1
mixture 1
of 1
bad 1
painting 1
and 1
good 1
intentions 1
that 1
always 1
entitles 1
a 1
man 1
to 1
be 1
called 1
a 1
representative 1
British 1
artist 1
Did 1
you 1
advertise 1
for 1
it 1
You 1
should 1
I 1
forget 1
said 1
Dorian 1
I 1
suppose 1
I 1
did 1
But 1
I 1
never 1
really 1
liked 1
it 1
I 1
am 1
sorry 1
I 1
sat 1
for 1
it 1
The 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
thing 1
is 1
hateful 1
to 1
me 1
Why 1
do 1
you 1
talk 1
of 1
it 1
It 1
used 1
to 1
remind 1
me 1
of 1
those 1
curious 1
lines 1
in 1
some 1
play 1
Hamlet 1
I 1
think 1
how 1
do 1
they 1
run 1
Like 1
the 1
painting 1
of 1
a 1
sorrow 1
A 1
face 1
without 1
a 1
heart 1
Yes 1
that 1
is 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
like 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
laughed 1
If 1
a 1
man 1
treats 1
life 1
artistically 1
his 1
brain 1
is 1
his 1
heart 1
he 1
answered 1
sinking 1
into 1
an 1
arm 1
chair 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
struck 1
some 1
soft 1
chords 1
on 1
the 1
piano 1
Like 1
the 1
painting 1
of 1
a 1
sorrow 1
he 1
repeated 1
a 1
face 1
without 1
a 1
heart 1
The 1
elder 1
man 1
lay 1
back 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
with 1
half 1
closed 1
eyes 1
By 1
the 1
way 1
Dorian 1
he 1
said 1
after 1
a 1
pause 1
what 1
does 1
it 1
profit 1
a 1
man 1
if 1
he 1
gain 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
and 1
lose 1
how 1
does 1
the 1
quotation 1
run 1
his 1
own 1
soul 1
The 1
music 1
jarred 1
and 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
started 1
and 1
stared 1
at 1
his 1
friend 1
Why 1
do 1
you 1
ask 1
me 1
that 1
Harry 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
elevating 1
his 1
eyebrows 1
in 1
surprise 1
I 1
asked 1
you 1
because 1
I 1
thought 1
you 1
might 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
give 1
me 1
an 1
answer 1
That 1
is 1
all 1
I 1
was 1
going 1
through 1
the 1
park 1
last 1
Sunday 1
and 1
close 1
by 1
the 1
Marble 1
Arch 1
there 1
stood 1
a 1
little 1
crowd 1
of 1
shabby 1
looking 1
people 1
listening 1
to 1
some 1
vulgar 1
street 1
preacher 1
As 1
I 1
passed 1
by 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
man 1
yelling 1
out 1
that 1
question 1
to 1
his 1
audience 1
It 1
struck 1
me 1
as 1
being 1
rather 1
dramatic 1
London 1
is 1
very 1
rich 1
in 1
curious 1
effects 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
A 1
wet 1
Sunday 1
an 1
uncouth 1
Christian 1
in 1
a 1
mackintosh 1
a 1
ring 1
of 1
sickly 1
white 1
faces 1
under 1
a 1
broken 1
roof 1
of 1
dripping 1
umbrellas 1
and 1
a 1
wonderful 1
phrase 1
flung 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
by 1
shrill 1
hysterical 1
lips 1
it 1
was 1
really 1
very 1
good 1
in 1
its 1
way 1
quite 1
a 1
suggestion 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
telling 1
the 1
prophet 1
that 1
art 1
had 1
a 1
soul 1
but 1
that 1
man 1
had 1
not 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
however 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
understood 1
me 1
Don 1
t 1
Harry 1
The 1
soul 1
is 1
a 1
terrible 1
reality 1
It 1
can 1
be 1
bought 1
and 1
sold 1
and 1
bartered 1
away 1
It 1
can 1
be 1
poisoned 1
or 1
made 1
perfect 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
soul 1
in 1
each 1
one 1
of 1
us 1
I 1
know 1
it 1
Do 1
you 1
feel 1
quite 1
sure 1
of 1
that 1
Dorian 1
Quite 1
sure 1
Ah 1
then 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
an 1
illusion 1
The 1
things 1
one 1
feels 1
absolutely 1
certain 1
about 1
are 1
never 1
true 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
fatality 1
of 1
faith 1
and 1
the 1
lesson 1
of 1
romance 1
How 1
grave 1
you 1
are 1
Don 1
t 1
be 1
so 1
serious 1
What 1
have 1
you 1
or 1
I 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
the 1
superstitions 1
of 1
our 1
age 1
No 1
we 1
have 1
given 1
up 1
our 1
belief 1
in 1
the 1
soul 1
Play 1
me 1
something 1
Play 1
me 1
a 1
nocturne 1
Dorian 1
and 1
as 1
you 1
play 1
tell 1
me 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
voice 1
how 1
you 1
have 1
kept 1
your 1
youth 1
You 1
must 1
have 1
some 1
secret 1
I 1
am 1
only 1
ten 1
years 1
older 1
than 1
you 1
are 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
wrinkled 1
and 1
worn 1
and 1
yellow 1
You 1
are 1
really 1
wonderful 1
Dorian 1
You 1
have 1
never 1
looked 1
more 1
charming 1
than 1
you 1
do 1
to 1
night 1
You 1
remind 1
me 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
I 1
saw 1
you 1
first 1
You 1
were 1
rather 1
cheeky 1
very 1
shy 1
and 1
absolutely 1
extraordinary 1
You 1
have 1
changed 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
not 1
in 1
appearance 1
I 1
wish 1
you 1
would 1
tell 1
me 1
your 1
secret 1
To 1
get 1
back 1
my 1
youth 1
I 1
would 1
do 1
anything 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
except 1
take 1
exercise 1
get 1
up 1
early 1
or 1
be 1
respectable 1
Youth 1
There 1
is 1
nothing 1
like 1
it 1
It 1
s 1
absurd 1
to 1
talk 1
of 1
the 1
ignorance 1
of 1
youth 1
The 1
only 1
people 1
to 1
whose 1
opinions 1
I 1
listen 1
now 1
with 1
any 1
respect 1
are 1
people 1
much 1
younger 1
than 1
myself 1
They 1
seem 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
me 1
Life 1
has 1
revealed 1
to 1
them 1
her 1
latest 1
wonder 1
As 1
for 1
the 1
aged 1
I 1
always 1
contradict 1
the 1
aged 1
I 1
do 1
it 1
on 1
principle 1
If 1
you 1
ask 1
them 1
their 1
opinion 1
on 1
something 1
that 1
happened 1
yesterday 1
they 1
solemnly 1
give 1
you 1
the 1
opinions 1
current 1
in 1
when 1
people 1
wore 1
high 1
stocks 1
believed 1
in 1
everything 1
and 1
knew 1
absolutely 1
nothing 1
How 1
lovely 1
that 1
thing 1
you 1
are 1
playing 1
is 1
I 1
wonder 1
did 1
Chopin 1
write 1
it 1
at 1
Majorca 1
with 1
the 1
sea 1
weeping 1
round 1
the 1
villa 1
and 1
the 1
salt 1
spray 1
dashing 1
against 1
the 1
panes 1
It 1
is 1
marvellously 1
romantic 1
What 1
a 1
blessing 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
one 1
art 1
left 1
to 1
us 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
imitative 1
Don 1
t 1
stop 1
I 1
want 1
music 1
to 1
night 1
It 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
young 1
Apollo 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
Marsyas 1
listening 1
to 1
you 1
I 1
have 1
sorrows 1
Dorian 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
that 1
even 1
you 1
know 1
nothing 1
of 1
The 1
tragedy 1
of 1
old 1
age 1
is 1
not 1
that 1
one 1
is 1
old 1
but 1
that 1
one 1
is 1
young 1
I 1
am 1
amazed 1
sometimes 1
at 1
my 1
own 1
sincerity 1
Ah 1
Dorian 1
how 1
happy 1
you 1
are 1
What 1
an 1
exquisite 1
life 1
you 1
have 1
had 1
You 1
have 1
drunk 1
deeply 1
of 1
everything 1
You 1
have 1
crushed 1
the 1
grapes 1
against 1
your 1
palate 1
Nothing 1
has 1
been 1
hidden 1
from 1
you 1
And 1
it 1
has 1
all 1
been 1
to 1
you 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
music 1
It 1
has 1
not 1
marred 1
you 1
You 1
are 1
still 1
the 1
same 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
the 1
same 1
Harry 1
Yes 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
same 1
I 1
wonder 1
what 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
your 1
life 1
will 1
be 1
Don 1
t 1
spoil 1
it 1
by 1
renunciations 1
At 1
present 1
you 1
are 1
a 1
perfect 1
type 1
Don 1
t 1
make 1
yourself 1
incomplete 1
You 1
are 1
quite 1
flawless 1
now 1
You 1
need 1
not 1
shake 1
your 1
head 1
you 1
know 1
you 1
are 1
Besides 1
Dorian 1
don 1
t 1
deceive 1
yourself 1
Life 1
is 1
not 1
governed 1
by 1
will 1
or 1
intention 1
Life 1
is 1
a 1
question 1
of 1
nerves 1
and 1
fibres 1
and 1
slowly 1
built 1
up 1
cells 1
in 1
which 1
thought 1
hides 1
itself 1
and 1
passion 1
has 1
its 1
dreams 1
You 1
may 1
fancy 1
yourself 1
safe 1
and 1
think 1
yourself 1
strong 1
But 1
a 1
chance 1
tone 1
of 1
colour 1
in 1
a 1
room 1
or 1
a 1
morning 1
sky 1
a 1
particular 1
perfume 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
once 1
loved 1
and 1
that 1
brings 1
subtle 1
memories 1
with 1
it 1
a 1
line 1
from 1
a 1
forgotten 1
poem 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
come 1
across 1
again 1
a 1
cadence 1
from 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
music 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
play 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
Dorian 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
on 1
things 1
like 1
these 1
that 1
our 1
lives 1
depend 1
Browning 1
writes 1
about 1
that 1
somewhere 1
but 1
our 1
own 1
senses 1
will 1
imagine 1
them 1
for 1
us 1
There 1
are 1
moments 1
when 1
the 1
odour 1
of 1
lilas 1
blanc 1
passes 1
suddenly 1
across 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
to 1
live 1
the 1
strangest 1
month 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
over 1
again 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
could 1
change 1
places 1
with 1
you 1
Dorian 1
The 1
world 1
has 1
cried 1
out 1
against 1
us 1
both 1
but 1
it 1
has 1
always 1
worshipped 1
you 1
It 1
always 1
will 1
worship 1
you 1
You 1
are 1
the 1
type 1
of 1
what 1
the 1
age 1
is 1
searching 1
for 1
and 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
afraid 1
it 1
has 1
found 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
glad 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
never 1
done 1
anything 1
never 1
carved 1
a 1
statue 1
or 1
painted 1
a 1
picture 1
or 1
produced 1
anything 1
outside 1
of 1
yourself 1
Life 1
has 1
been 1
your 1
art 1
You 1
have 1
set 1
yourself 1
to 1
music 1
Your 1
days 1
are 1
your 1
sonnets 1
Dorian 1
rose 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
piano 1
and 1
passed 1
his 1
hand 1
through 1
his 1
hair 1
Yes 1
life 1
has 1
been 1
exquisite 1
he 1
murmured 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
same 1
life 1
Harry 1
And 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
say 1
these 1
extravagant 1
things 1
to 1
me 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
everything 1
about 1
me 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
if 1
you 1
did 1
even 1
you 1
would 1
turn 1
from 1
me 1
You 1
laugh 1
Don 1
t 1
laugh 1
Why 1
have 1
you 1
stopped 1
playing 1
Dorian 1
Go 1
back 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
nocturne 1
over 1
again 1
Look 1
at 1
that 1
great 1
honey 1
coloured 1
moon 1
that 1
hangs 1
in 1
the 1
dusky 1
air 1
She 1
is 1
waiting 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
charm 1
her 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
play 1
she 1
will 1
come 1
closer 1
to 1
the 1
earth 1
You 1
won 1
t 1
Let 1
us 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
club 1
then 1
It 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
charming 1
evening 1
and 1
we 1
must 1
end 1
it 1
charmingly 1
There 1
is 1
some 1
one 1
at 1
White 1
s 1
who 1
wants 1
immensely 1
to 1
know 1
you 1
young 1
Lord 1
Poole 1
Bournemouth 1
s 1
eldest 1
son 1
He 1
has 1
already 1
copied 1
your 1
neckties 1
and 1
has 1
begged 1
me 1
to 1
introduce 1
him 1
to 1
you 1
He 1
is 1
quite 1
delightful 1
and 1
rather 1
reminds 1
me 1
of 1
you 1
I 1
hope 1
not 1
said 1
Dorian 1
with 1
a 1
sad 1
look 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
But 1
I 1
am 1
tired 1
to 1
night 1
Harry 1
I 1
shan 1
t 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
club 1
It 1
is 1
nearly 1
eleven 1
and 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
bed 1
early 1
Do 1
stay 1
You 1
have 1
never 1
played 1
so 1
well 1
as 1
to 1
night 1
There 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
your 1
touch 1
that 1
was 1
wonderful 1
It 1
had 1
more 1
expression 1
than 1
I 1
had 1
ever 1
heard 1
from 1
it 1
before 1
It 1
is 1
because 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
good 1
he 1
answered 1
smiling 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
little 1
changed 1
already 1
You 1
cannot 1
change 1
to 1
me 1
Dorian 1
said 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
You 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
always 1
be 1
friends 1
Yet 1
you 1
poisoned 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
book 1
once 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
forgive 1
that 1
Harry 1
promise 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
never 1
lend 1
that 1
book 1
to 1
any 1
one 1
It 1
does 1
harm 1
My 1
dear 1
boy 1
you 1
are 1
really 1
beginning 1
to 1
moralize 1
You 1
will 1
soon 1
be 1
going 1
about 1
like 1
the 1
converted 1
and 1
the 1
revivalist 1
warning 1
people 1
against 1
all 1
the 1
sins 1
of 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
grown 1
tired 1
You 1
are 1
much 1
too 1
delightful 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
Besides 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
use 1
You 1
and 1
I 1
are 1
what 1
we 1
are 1
and 1
will 1
be 1
what 1
we 1
will 1
be 1
As 1
for 1
being 1
poisoned 1
by 1
a 1
book 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
such 1
thing 1
as 1
that 1
Art 1
has 1
no 1
influence 1
upon 1
action 1
It 1
annihilates 1
the 1
desire 1
to 1
act 1
It 1
is 1
superbly 1
sterile 1
The 1
books 1
that 1
the 1
world 1
calls 1
immoral 1
are 1
books 1
that 1
show 1
the 1
world 1
its 1
own 1
shame 1
That 1
is 1
all 1
But 1
we 1
won 1
t 1
discuss 1
literature 1
Come 1
round 1
to 1
morrow 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
ride 1
at 1
eleven 1
We 1
might 1
go 1
together 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
take 1
you 1
to 1
lunch 1
afterwards 1
with 1
Lady 1
Branksome 1
She 1
is 1
a 1
charming 1
woman 1
and 1
wants 1
to 1
consult 1
you 1
about 1
some 1
tapestries 1
she 1
is 1
thinking 1
of 1
buying 1
Mind 1
you 1
come 1
Or 1
shall 1
we 1
lunch 1
with 1
our 1
little 1
duchess 1
She 1
says 1
she 1
never 1
sees 1
you 1
now 1
Perhaps 1
you 1
are 1
tired 1
of 1
Gladys 1
I 1
thought 1
you 1
would 1
be 1
Her 1
clever 1
tongue 1
gets 1
on 1
one 1
s 1
nerves 1
Well 1
in 1
any 1
case 1
be 1
here 1
at 1
eleven 1
Must 1
I 1
really 1
come 1
Harry 1
Certainly 1
The 1
park 1
is 1
quite 1
lovely 1
now 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
there 1
have 1
been 1
such 1
lilacs 1
since 1
the 1
year 1
I 1
met 1
you 1
Very 1
well 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
here 1
at 1
eleven 1
said 1
Dorian 1
Good 1
night 1
Harry 1
As 1
he 1
reached 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
hesitated 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
something 1
more 1
to 1
say 1
Then 1
he 1
sighed 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
CHAPTER 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
lovely 1
night 1
so 1
warm 1
that 1
he 1
threw 1
his 1
coat 1
over 1
his 1
arm 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
even 1
put 1
his 1
silk 1
scarf 1
round 1
his 1
throat 1
As 1
he 1
strolled 1
home 1
smoking 1
his 1
cigarette 1
two 1
young 1
men 1
in 1
evening 1
dress 1
passed 1
him 1
He 1
heard 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
whisper 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
That 1
is 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
He 1
remembered 1
how 1
pleased 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
pointed 1
out 1
or 1
stared 1
at 1
or 1
talked 1
about 1
He 1
was 1
tired 1
of 1
hearing 1
his 1
own 1
name 1
now 1
Half 1
the 1
charm 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
village 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
so 1
often 1
lately 1
was 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
knew 1
who 1
he 1
was 1
He 1
had 1
often 1
told 1
the 1
girl 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
lured 1
to 1
love 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
poor 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
believed 1
him 1
He 1
had 1
told 1
her 1
once 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
wicked 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
laughed 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
answered 1
that 1
wicked 1
people 1
were 1
always 1
very 1
old 1
and 1
very 1
ugly 1
What 1
a 1
laugh 1
she 1
had 1
just 1
like 1
a 1
thrush 1
singing 1
And 1
how 1
pretty 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
her 1
cotton 1
dresses 1
and 1
her 1
large 1
hats 1
She 1
knew 1
nothing 1
but 1
she 1
had 1
everything 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
lost 1
When 1
he 1
reached 1
home 1
he 1
found 1
his 1
servant 1
waiting 1
up 1
for 1
him 1
He 1
sent 1
him 1
to 1
bed 1
and 1
threw 1
himself 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
sofa 1
in 1
the 1
library 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
over 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
things 1
that 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
had 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
Was 1
it 1
really 1
true 1
that 1
one 1
could 1
never 1
change 1
He 1
felt 1
a 1
wild 1
longing 1
for 1
the 1
unstained 1
purity 1
of 1
his 1
boyhood 1
his 1
rose 1
white 1
boyhood 1
as 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
had 1
once 1
called 1
it 1
He 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
tarnished 1
himself 1
filled 1
his 1
mind 1
with 1
corruption 1
and 1
given 1
horror 1
to 1
his 1
fancy 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
an 1
evil 1
influence 1
to 1
others 1
and 1
had 1
experienced 1
a 1
terrible 1
joy 1
in 1
being 1
so 1
and 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
lives 1
that 1
had 1
crossed 1
his 1
own 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
fairest 1
and 1
the 1
most 1
full 1
of 1
promise 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
brought 1
to 1
shame 1
But 1
was 1
it 1
all 1
irretrievable 1
Was 1
there 1
no 1
hope 1
for 1
him 1
Ah 1
in 1
what 1
a 1
monstrous 1
moment 1
of 1
pride 1
and 1
passion 1
he 1
had 1
prayed 1
that 1
the 1
portrait 1
should 1
bear 1
the 1
burden 1
of 1
his 1
days 1
and 1
he 1
keep 1
the 1
unsullied 1
splendour 1
of 1
eternal 1
youth 1
All 1
his 1
failure 1
had 1
been 1
due 1
to 1
that 1
Better 1
for 1
him 1
that 1
each 1
sin 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
had 1
brought 1
its 1
sure 1
swift 1
penalty 1
along 1
with 1
it 1
There 1
was 1
purification 1
in 1
punishment 1
Not 1
Forgive 1
us 1
our 1
sins 1
but 1
Smite 1
us 1
for 1
our 1
iniquities 1
should 1
be 1
the 1
prayer 1
of 1
man 1
to 1
a 1
most 1
just 1
God 1
The 1
curiously 1
carved 1
mirror 1
that 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
had 1
given 1
to 1
him 1
so 1
many 1
years 1
ago 1
now 1
was 1
standing 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
the 1
white 1
limbed 1
Cupids 1
laughed 1
round 1
it 1
as 1
of 1
old 1
He 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
on 1
that 1
night 1
of 1
horror 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
first 1
noted 1
the 1
change 1
in 1
the 1
fatal 1
picture 1
and 1
with 1
wild 1
tear 1
dimmed 1
eyes 1
looked 1
into 1
its 1
polished 1
shield 1
Once 1
some 1
one 1
who 1
had 1
terribly 1
loved 1
him 1
had 1
written 1
to 1
him 1
a 1
mad 1
letter 1
ending 1
with 1
these 1
idolatrous 1
words 1
The 1
world 1
is 1
changed 1
because 1
you 1
are 1
made 1
of 1
ivory 1
and 1
gold 1
The 1
curves 1
of 1
your 1
lips 1
rewrite 1
history 1
The 1
phrases 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
memory 1
and 1
he 1
repeated 1
them 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
to 1
himself 1
Then 1
he 1
loathed 1
his 1
own 1
beauty 1
and 1
flinging 1
the 1
mirror 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
crushed 1
it 1
into 1
silver 1
splinters 1
beneath 1
his 1
heel 1
It 1
was 1
his 1
beauty 1
that 1
had 1
ruined 1
him 1
his 1
beauty 1
and 1
the 1
youth 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
prayed 1
for 1
But 1
for 1
those 1
two 1
things 1
his 1
life 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
free 1
from 1
stain 1
His 1
beauty 1
had 1
been 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
a 1
mask 1
his 1
youth 1
but 1
a 1
mockery 1
What 1
was 1
youth 1
at 1
best 1
A 1
green 1
an 1
unripe 1
time 1
a 1
time 1
of 1
shallow 1
moods 1
and 1
sickly 1
thoughts 1
Why 1
had 1
he 1
worn 1
its 1
livery 1
Youth 1
had 1
spoiled 1
him 1
It 1
was 1
better 1
not 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
past 1
Nothing 1
could 1
alter 1
that 1
It 1
was 1
of 1
himself 1
and 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
future 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
think 1
James 1
Vane 1
was 1
hidden 1
in 1
a 1
nameless 1
grave 1
in 1
Selby 1
churchyard 1
Alan 1
Campbell 1
had 1
shot 1
himself 1
one 1
night 1
in 1
his 1
laboratory 1
but 1
had 1
not 1
revealed 1
the 1
secret 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
forced 1
to 1
know 1
The 1
excitement 1
such 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
over 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
s 1
disappearance 1
would 1
soon 1
pass 1
away 1
It 1
was 1
already 1
waning 1
He 1
was 1
perfectly 1
safe 1
there 1
Nor 1
indeed 1
was 1
it 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
that 1
weighed 1
most 1
upon 1
his 1
mind 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
living 1
death 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
soul 1
that 1
troubled 1
him 1
Basil 1
had 1
painted 1
the 1
portrait 1
that 1
had 1
marred 1
his 1
life 1
He 1
could 1
not 1
forgive 1
him 1
that 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
portrait 1
that 1
had 1
done 1
everything 1
Basil 1
had 1
said 1
things 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
were 1
unbearable 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
yet 1
borne 1
with 1
patience 1
The 1
murder 1
had 1
been 1
simply 1
the 1
madness 1
of 1
a 1
moment 1
As 1
for 1
Alan 1
Campbell 1
his 1
suicide 1
had 1
been 1
his 1
own 1
act 1
He 1
had 1
chosen 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
It 1
was 1
nothing 1
to 1
him 1
A 1
new 1
life 1
That 1
was 1
what 1
he 1
wanted 1
That 1
was 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
waiting 1
for 1
Surely 1
he 1
had 1
begun 1
it 1
already 1
He 1
had 1
spared 1
one 1
innocent 1
thing 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
He 1
would 1
never 1
again 1
tempt 1
innocence 1
He 1
would 1
be 1
good 1
As 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
Hetty 1
Merton 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
wonder 1
if 1
the 1
portrait 1
in 1
the 1
locked 1
room 1
had 1
changed 1
Surely 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
still 1
so 1
horrible 1
as 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
Perhaps 1
if 1
his 1
life 1
became 1
pure 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
expel 1
every 1
sign 1
of 1
evil 1
passion 1
from 1
the 1
face 1
Perhaps 1
the 1
signs 1
of 1
evil 1
had 1
already 1
gone 1
away 1
He 1
would 1
go 1
and 1
look 1
He 1
took 1
the 1
lamp 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
crept 1
upstairs 1
As 1
he 1
unbarred 1
the 1
door 1
a 1
smile 1
of 1
joy 1
flitted 1
across 1
his 1
strangely 1
young 1
looking 1
face 1
and 1
lingered 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
about 1
his 1
lips 1
Yes 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
good 1
and 1
the 1
hideous 1
thing 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
hidden 1
away 1
would 1
no 1
longer 1
be 1
a 1
terror 1
to 1
him 1
He 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
load 1
had 1
been 1
lifted 1
from 1
him 1
already 1
He 1
went 1
in 1
quietly 1
locking 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
him 1
as 1
was 1
his 1
custom 1
and 1
dragged 1
the 1
purple 1
hanging 1
from 1
the 1
portrait 1
A 1
cry 1
of 1
pain 1
and 1
indignation 1
broke 1
from 1
him 1
He 1
could 1
see 1
no 1
change 1
save 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
eyes 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
cunning 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
mouth 1
the 1
curved 1
wrinkle 1
of 1
the 1
hypocrite 1
The 1
thing 1
was 1
still 1
loathsome 1
more 1
loathsome 1
if 1
possible 1
than 1
before 1
and 1
the 1
scarlet 1
dew 1
that 1
spotted 1
the 1
hand 1
seemed 1
brighter 1
and 1
more 1
like 1
blood 1
newly 1
spilled 1
Then 1
he 1
trembled 1
Had 1
it 1
been 1
merely 1
vanity 1
that 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
do 1
his 1
one 1
good 1
deed 1
Or 1
the 1
desire 1
for 1
a 1
new 1
sensation 1
as 1
Lord 1
Henry 1
had 1
hinted 1
with 1
his 1
mocking 1
laugh 1
Or 1
that 1
passion 1
to 1
act 1
a 1
part 1
that 1
sometimes 1
makes 1
us 1
do 1
things 1
finer 1
than 1
we 1
are 1
ourselves 1
Or 1
perhaps 1
all 1
these 1
And 1
why 1
was 1
the 1
red 1
stain 1
larger 1
than 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
It 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
crept 1
like 1
a 1
horrible 1
disease 1
over 1
the 1
wrinkled 1
fingers 1
There 1
was 1
blood 1
on 1
the 1
painted 1
feet 1
as 1
though 1
the 1
thing 1
had 1
dripped 1
blood 1
even 1
on 1
the 1
hand 1
that 1
had 1
not 1
held 1
the 1
knife 1
Confess 1
Did 1
it 1
mean 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
confess 1
To 1
give 1
himself 1
up 1
and 1
be 1
put 1
to 1
death 1
He 1
laughed 1
He 1
felt 1
that 1
the 1
idea 1
was 1
monstrous 1
Besides 1
even 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
confess 1
who 1
would 1
believe 1
him 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
trace 1
of 1
the 1
murdered 1
man 1
anywhere 1
Everything 1
belonging 1
to 1
him 1
had 1
been 1
destroyed 1
He 1
himself 1
had 1
burned 1
what 1
had 1
been 1
below 1
stairs 1
The 1
world 1
would 1
simply 1
say 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
mad 1
They 1
would 1
shut 1
him 1
up 1
if 1
he 1
persisted 1
in 1
his 1
story 1
Yet 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
duty 1
to 1
confess 1
to 1
suffer 1
public 1
shame 1
and 1
to 1
make 1
public 1
atonement 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
God 1
who 1
called 1
upon 1
men 1
to 1
tell 1
their 1
sins 1
to 1
earth 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
to 1
heaven 1
Nothing 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
do 1
would 1
cleanse 1
him 1
till 1
he 1
had 1
told 1
his 1
own 1
sin 1
His 1
sin 1
He 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
The 1
death 1
of 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
seemed 1
very 1
little 1
to 1
him 1
He 1
was 1
thinking 1
of 1
Hetty 1
Merton 1
For 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
unjust 1
mirror 1
this 1
mirror 1
of 1
his 1
soul 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
looking 1
at 1
Vanity 1
Curiosity 1
Hypocrisy 1
Had 1
there 1
been 1
nothing 1
more 1
in 1
his 1
renunciation 1
than 1
that 1
There 1
had 1
been 1
something 1
more 1
At 1
least 1
he 1
thought 1
so 1
But 1
who 1
could 1
tell 1
No 1
There 1
had 1
been 1
nothing 1
more 1
Through 1
vanity 1
he 1
had 1
spared 1
her 1
In 1
hypocrisy 1
he 1
had 1
worn 1
the 1
mask 1
of 1
goodness 1
For 1
curiosity 1
s 1
sake 1
he 1
had 1
tried 1
the 1
denial 1
of 1
self 1
He 1
recognized 1
that 1
now 1
But 1
this 1
murder 1
was 1
it 1
to 1
dog 1
him 1
all 1
his 1
life 1
Was 1
he 1
always 1
to 1
be 1
burdened 1
by 1
his 1
past 1
Was 1
he 1
really 1
to 1
confess 1
Never 1
There 1
was 1
only 1
one 1
bit 1
of 1
evidence 1
left 1
against 1
him 1
The 1
picture 1
itself 1
that 1
was 1
evidence 1
He 1
would 1
destroy 1
it 1
Why 1
had 1
he 1
kept 1
it 1
so 1
long 1
Once 1
it 1
had 1
given 1
him 1
pleasure 1
to 1
watch 1
it 1
changing 1
and 1
growing 1
old 1
Of 1
late 1
he 1
had 1
felt 1
no 1
such 1
pleasure 1
It 1
had 1
kept 1
him 1
awake 1
at 1
night 1
When 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
away 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
filled 1
with 1
terror 1
lest 1
other 1
eyes 1
should 1
look 1
upon 1
it 1
It 1
had 1
brought 1
melancholy 1
across 1
his 1
passions 1
Its 1
mere 1
memory 1
had 1
marred 1
many 1
moments 1
of 1
joy 1
It 1
had 1
been 1
like 1
conscience 1
to 1
him 1
Yes 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
conscience 1
He 1
would 1
destroy 1
it 1
He 1
looked 1
round 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
knife 1
that 1
had 1
stabbed 1
Basil 1
Hallward 1
He 1
had 1
cleaned 1
it 1
many 1
times 1
till 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
stain 1
left 1
upon 1
it 1
It 1
was 1
bright 1
and 1
glistened 1
As 1
it 1
had 1
killed 1
the 1
painter 1
so 1
it 1
would 1
kill 1
the 1
painter 1
s 1
work 1
and 1
all 1
that 2
meant 1
It 1
would 1
kill 1
the 1
past 1
and 1
when 1
that 1
was 1
dead 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
free 1
It 1
would 1
kill 1
this 1
monstrous 1
soul 1
life 1
and 1
without 1
its 1
hideous 1
warnings 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
at 1
peace 1
He 1
seized 1
the 1
thing 1
and 1
stabbed 1
the 1
picture 1
with 1
it 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
cry 1
heard 1
and 1
a 1
crash 1
The 1
cry 1
was 1
so 1
horrible 1
in 1
its 1
agony 1
that 1
the 1
frightened 1
servants 1
woke 1
and 1
crept 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
rooms 1
Two 1
gentlemen 1
who 1
were 1
passing 1
in 1
the 1
square 1
below 1
stopped 1
and 1
looked 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
great 1
house 1
They 1
walked 1
on 1
till 1
they 1
met 1
a 1
policeman 1
and 1
brought 1
him 1
back 1
The 1
man 1
rang 1
the 1
bell 1
several 1
times 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
answer 1
Except 1
for 1
a 1
light 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
top 1
windows 1
the 1
house 1
was 1
all 1
dark 1
After 1
a 1
time 1
he 1
went 1
away 1
and 1
stood 1
in 1
an 1
adjoining 1
portico 1
and 1
watched 1
Whose 1
house 1
is 1
that 1
Constable 1
asked 1
the 1
elder 1
of 1
the 1
two 1
gentlemen 1
Mr 1
Dorian 1
Gray 1
s 1
sir 1
answered 1
the 1
policeman 1
They 1
looked 1
at 1
each 1
other 1
as 1
they 1
walked 1
away 1
and 1
sneered 1
One 1
of 1
them 1
was 1
Sir 1
Henry 1
Ashton 1
s 1
uncle 1
Inside 1
in 1
the 1
servants 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
the 1
half 1
clad 1
domestics 1
were 1
talking 1
in 1
low 1
whispers 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
Old 1
Mrs 1
Leaf 1
was 1
crying 1
and 1
wringing 1
her 1
hands 1
Francis 1
was 1
as 1
pale 1
as 1
death 1
After 1
about 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
he 1
got 1
the 1
coachman 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
footmen 1
and 1
crept 1
upstairs 1
They 1
knocked 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
reply 1
They 1
called 1
out 1
Everything 1
was 1
still 1
Finally 1
after 1
vainly 1
trying 1
to 1
force 1
the 1
door 1
they 1
got 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
and 1
dropped 1
down 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
balcony 1
The 1
windows 1
yielded 1
easily 1
their 1
bolts 1
were 1
old 1
When 1
they 1
entered 1
they 1
found 1
hanging 1
upon 1
the 1
wall 1
a 1
splendid 1
portrait 1
of 1
their 1
master 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
last 1
seen 1
him 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
wonder 1
of 1
his 1
exquisite 1
youth 1
and 1
beauty 1
Lying 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
was 1
a 1
dead 1
man 1
in 1
evening 1
dress 1
with 1
a 1
knife 1
in 1
his 1
heart 1
He 1
was 1
withered 1
wrinkled 1
and 1
loathsome 1
of 1
visage 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
till 1
they 1
had 1
examined 1
the 1
rings 1
that 1
they 1
recognized 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
