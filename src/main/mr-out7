ADVENTURE 1
I 1
A 1
SCANDAL 1
IN 1
BOHEMIA 1
I 1
To 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
she 1
is 1
always 1
THE 1
woman 1
I 1
have 1
seldom 1
heard 1
him 1
mention 1
her 1
under 1
any 1
other 1
name 1
In 1
his 1
eyes 1
she 1
eclipses 1
and 1
predominates 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
her 1
sex 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
that 1
he 1
felt 1
any 1
emotion 1
akin 1
to 1
love 1
for 1
Irene 1
Adler 1
All 1
emotions 1
and 1
that 1
one 1
particularly 1
were 1
abhorrent 1
to 1
his 1
cold 1
precise 1
but 1
admirably 1
balanced 1
mind 1
He 1
was 1
I 1
take 1
it 1
the 1
most 1
perfect 1
reasoning 1
and 1
observing 1
machine 1
that 1
the 1
world 1
has 1
seen 1
but 1
as 1
a 1
lover 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
placed 1
himself 1
in 1
a 1
false 1
position 1
He 1
never 1
spoke 1
of 1
the 1
softer 1
passions 1
save 1
with 1
a 1
gibe 1
and 1
a 1
sneer 1
They 1
were 1
admirable 1
things 1
for 1
the 1
observer 1
excellent 1
for 1
drawing 1
the 1
veil 1
from 1
men 1
s 1
motives 1
and 1
actions 1
But 1
for 1
the 1
trained 1
reasoner 1
to 1
admit 1
such 1
intrusions 1
into 1
his 1
own 1
delicate 1
and 1
finely 1
adjusted 1
temperament 1
was 1
to 1
introduce 1
a 1
distracting 1
factor 1
which 1
might 1
throw 1
a 1
doubt 1
upon 1
all 1
his 1
mental 1
results 1
Grit 1
in 1
a 1
sensitive 1
instrument 1
or 1
a 1
crack 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
high 1
power 1
lenses 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
more 1
disturbing 1
than 1
a 1
strong 1
emotion 1
in 1
a 1
nature 1
such 1
as 1
his 1
And 1
yet 1
there 1
was 1
but 1
one 1
woman 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
that 1
woman 1
was 1
the 1
late 1
Irene 1
Adler 1
of 1
dubious 1
and 1
questionable 1
memory 1
I 1
had 1
seen 1
little 1
of 1
Holmes 1
lately 1
My 1
marriage 1
had 1
drifted 1
us 1
away 1
from 1
each 1
other 1
My 1
own 1
complete 1
happiness 1
and 1
the 1
home 1
centred 1
interests 1
which 1
rise 1
up 1
around 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
first 1
finds 1
himself 1
master 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
establishment 1
were 1
sufficient 1
to 1
absorb 1
all 1
my 1
attention 1
while 1
Holmes 1
who 1
loathed 1
every 1
form 1
of 1
society 1
with 1
his 1
whole 1
Bohemian 1
soul 1
remained 1
in 1
our 1
lodgings 1
in 1
Baker 1
Street 1
buried 1
among 1
his 1
old 1
books 1
and 1
alternating 1
from 1
week 1
to 1
week 1
between 1
cocaine 1
and 1
ambition 1
the 1
drowsiness 1
of 1
the 1
drug 1
and 1
the 1
fierce 1
energy 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
keen 1
nature 1
He 1
was 1
still 1
as 1
ever 1
deeply 1
attracted 1
by 1
the 1
study 1
of 1
crime 1
and 1
occupied 1
his 1
immense 1
faculties 1
and 1
extraordinary 1
powers 1
of 1
observation 1
in 1
following 1
out 1
those 1
clues 1
and 1
clearing 1
up 1
those 1
mysteries 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
abandoned 1
as 1
hopeless 1
by 1
the 1
official 1
police 1
From 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
I 1
heard 1
some 1
vague 1
account 1
of 1
his 1
doings 1
of 1
his 1
summons 1
to 1
Odessa 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
of 1
the 1
Trepoff 1
murder 1
of 1
his 1
clearing 1
up 1
of 1
the 1
singular 1
tragedy 1
of 1
the 1
Atkinson 1
brothers 1
at 1
Trincomalee 1
and 1
finally 1
of 1
the 1
mission 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
accomplished 1
so 1
delicately 1
and 1
successfully 1
for 1
the 1
reigning 1
family 1
of 1
Holland 1
Beyond 1
these 1
signs 1
of 1
his 1
activity 1
however 1
which 1
I 1
merely 1
shared 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
readers 1
of 1
the 1
daily 1
press 1
I 1
knew 1
little 1
of 1
my 1
former 1
friend 1
and 1
companion 1
One 1
night 1
it 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
twentieth 1
of 1
March 1
I 1
was 1
returning 1
from 1
a 1
journey 1
to 1
a 1
patient 1
for 1
I 1
had 1
now 1
returned 1
to 1
civil 1
practice 1
when 1
my 1
way 1
led 1
me 1
through 1
Baker 1
Street 1
As 1
I 1
passed 1
the 1
well 1
remembered 1
door 1
which 1
must 1
always 1
be 1
associated 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
with 1
my 1
wooing 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
dark 1
incidents 1
of 1
the 1
Study 1
in 1
Scarlet 1
I 1
was 1
seized 1
with 1
a 1
keen 1
desire 1
to 1
see 1
Holmes 1
again 1
and 1
to 1
know 1
how 1
he 1
was 1
employing 1
his 1
extraordinary 1
powers 1
His 1
rooms 1
were 1
brilliantly 1
lit 1
and 1
even 1
as 1
I 1
looked 1
up 1
I 1
saw 1
his 1
tall 1
spare 1
figure 1
pass 1
twice 1
in 1
a 1
dark 1
silhouette 1
against 1
the 1
blind 1
He 1
was 1
pacing 1
the 1
room 1
swiftly 1
eagerly 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
sunk 1
upon 1
his 1
chest 1
and 1
his 1
hands 1
clasped 1
behind 1
him 1
To 1
me 1
who 1
knew 1
his 1
every 1
mood 1
and 1
habit 1
his 1
attitude 1
and 1
manner 1
told 1
their 1
own 1
story 1
He 1
was 1
at 1
work 1
again 1
He 1
had 1
risen 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
drug 1
created 1
dreams 1
and 1
was 1
hot 1
upon 1
the 1
scent 1
of 1
some 1
new 1
problem 1
I 1
rang 1
the 1
bell 1
and 1
was 1
shown 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
chamber 1
which 1
had 1
formerly 1
been 1
in 1
part 1
my 1
own 1
His 1
manner 1
was 1
not 1
effusive 1
It 1
seldom 1
was 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
glad 1
I 1
think 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
With 1
hardly 1
a 1
word 1
spoken 1
but 1
with 1
a 1
kindly 1
eye 1
he 1
waved 1
me 1
to 1
an 1
armchair 1
threw 1
across 1
his 1
case 1
of 1
cigars 1
and 1
indicated 1
a 1
spirit 1
case 1
and 1
a 1
gasogene 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
Then 1
he 1
stood 1
before 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
looked 1
me 1
over 1
in 1
his 1
singular 1
introspective 1
fashion 1
Wedlock 1
suits 1
you 1
he 1
remarked 1
I 1
think 1
Watson 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
put 1
on 1
seven 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
pounds 1
since 1
I 1
saw 1
you 1
Seven 1
I 1
answered 1
Indeed 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
thought 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
Just 1
a 1
trifle 1
more 1
I 1
fancy 1
Watson 1
And 1
in 1
practice 1
again 1
I 1
observe 1
You 1
did 1
not 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
intended 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
harness 1
Then 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
I 1
see 1
it 1
I 1
deduce 1
it 1
How 1
do 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
getting 1
yourself 1
very 1
wet 1
lately 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
most 1
clumsy 1
and 1
careless 1
servant 1
girl 1
My 1
dear 1
Holmes 1
said 1
I 1
this 1
is 1
too 1
much 1
You 1
would 1
certainly 1
have 1
been 1
burned 1
had 1
you 1
lived 1
a 1
few 1
centuries 1
ago 1
It 1
is 1
true 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
country 1
walk 1
on 1
Thursday 1
and 1
came 1
home 1
in 1
a 1
dreadful 1
mess 1
but 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
changed 1
my 1
clothes 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
imagine 1
how 1
you 1
deduce 1
it 1
As 1
to 1
Mary 1
Jane 1
she 1
is 1
incorrigible 1
and 1
my 1
wife 1
has 1
given 1
her 1
notice 1
but 1
there 1
again 1
I 1
fail 1
to 1
see 1
how 1
you 1
work 1
it 1
out 1
He 1
chuckled 1
to 1
himself 1
and 1
rubbed 1
his 1
long 1
nervous 1
hands 1
together 1
It 1
is 1
simplicity 1
itself 1
said 1
he 1
my 1
eyes 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
on 1
the 1
inside 1
of 1
your 1
left 1
shoe 1
just 1
where 1
the 1
firelight 1
strikes 1
it 1
the 1
leather 1
is 1
scored 1
by 1
six 1
almost 1
parallel 1
cuts 1
Obviously 1
they 1
have 1
been 1
caused 1
by 1
someone 1
who 1
has 1
very 1
carelessly 1
scraped 1
round 1
the 1
edges 1
of 1
the 1
sole 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
remove 1
crusted 1
mud 1
from 1
it 1
Hence 1
you 1
see 1
my 1
double 1
deduction 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
been 1
out 1
in 1
vile 1
weather 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
a 1
particularly 1
malignant 1
boot 1
slitting 1
specimen 1
of 1
the 1
London 1
slavey 1
As 1
to 1
your 1
practice 1
if 1
a 1
gentleman 1
walks 1
into 1
my 1
rooms 1
smelling 1
of 1
iodoform 1
with 1
a 1
black 1
mark 1
of 1
nitrate 1
of 1
silver 1
upon 1
his 1
right 1
forefinger 1
and 1
a 1
bulge 1
on 1
the 1
right 1
side 1
of 1
his 1
top 1
hat 1
to 1
show 1
where 1
he 1
has 1
secreted 1
his 1
stethoscope 1
I 1
must 1
be 1
dull 1
indeed 1
if 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
pronounce 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
an 1
active 1
member 1
of 1
the 1
medical 1
profession 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
laughing 1
at 1
the 1
ease 1
with 1
which 1
he 1
explained 1
his 1
process 1
of 1
deduction 1
When 1
I 1
hear 1
you 1
give 1
your 1
reasons 1
I 1
remarked 1
the 1
thing 1
always 1
appears 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
ridiculously 1
simple 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
easily 1
do 1
it 1
myself 1
though 1
at 1
each 1
successive 1
instance 1
of 1
your 1
reasoning 1
I 1
am 1
baffled 1
until 1
you 1
explain 1
your 1
process 1
And 1
yet 1
I 1
believe 1
that 1
my 1
eyes 1
are 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
yours 1
Quite 1
so 1
he 1
answered 1
lighting 1
a 1
cigarette 1
and 1
throwing 1
himself 1
down 1
into 1
an 1
armchair 1
You 1
see 1
but 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
observe 1
The 1
distinction 1
is 1
clear 1
For 1
example 1
you 1
have 1
frequently 1
seen 1
the 1
steps 1
which 1
lead 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
hall 1
to 1
this 1
room 1
Frequently 1
How 1
often 1
Well 1
some 1
hundreds 1
of 1
times 1
Then 1
how 1
many 1
are 1
there 1
How 1
many 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
Quite 1
so 1
You 1
have 1
not 1
observed 1
And 1
yet 1
you 1
have 1
seen 1
That 1
is 1
just 1
my 1
point 1
Now 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
seventeen 1
steps 1
because 1
I 1
have 1
both 1
seen 1
and 1
observed 1
By 1
the 1
way 1
since 1
you 1
are 1
interested 1
in 1
these 1
little 1
problems 1
and 1
since 1
you 1
are 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
chronicle 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
of 1
my 1
trifling 1
experiences 1
you 1
may 1
be 1
interested 1
in 1
this 1
He 1
threw 1
over 1
a 1
sheet 1
of 1
thick 1
pink 1
tinted 1
note 1
paper 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
lying 1
open 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
It 1
came 1
by 1
the 1
last 1
post 1
said 1
he 1
Read 1
it 1
aloud 1
The 1
note 1
was 1
undated 1
and 1
without 1
either 1
signature 1
or 1
address 1
There 1
will 1
call 1
upon 1
you 1
to 1
night 1
at 1
a 1
quarter 1
to 1
eight 1
o 1
clock 1
it 1
said 1
a 1
gentleman 1
who 1
desires 1
to 1
consult 1
you 1
upon 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
the 1
very 1
deepest 1
moment 1
Your 1
recent 1
services 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
royal 1
houses 1
of 1
Europe 1
have 1
shown 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
one 1
who 1
may 1
safely 1
be 1
trusted 1
with 1
matters 1
which 1
are 1
of 1
an 1
importance 1
which 1
can 1
hardly 1
be 1
exaggerated 1
This 1
account 1
of 1
you 1
we 1
have 1
from 1
all 1
quarters 1
received 1
Be 1
in 1
your 1
chamber 1
then 1
at 1
that 1
hour 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
take 1
it 1
amiss 1
if 1
your 1
visitor 1
wear 1
a 1
mask 1
This 1
is 1
indeed 1
a 1
mystery 1
I 1
remarked 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
imagine 1
that 1
it 1
means 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
data 1
yet 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
capital 1
mistake 1
to 1
theorize 1
before 1
one 1
has 1
data 1
Insensibly 1
one 1
begins 1
to 1
twist 1
facts 1
to 1
suit 1
theories 1
instead 1
of 1
theories 1
to 1
suit 1
facts 1
But 1
the 1
note 1
itself 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
deduce 1
from 1
it 1
I 1
carefully 1
examined 1
the 1
writing 1
and 1
the 1
paper 1
upon 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
written 1
The 1
man 1
who 1
wrote 1
it 1
was 1
presumably 1
well 1
to 1
do 1
I 1
remarked 1
endeavouring 1

Such 1
paper 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
bought 1
under 1
half 1
a 1
crown 1
a 1
packet 1
It 1
is 1
peculiarly 1
strong 1
and 1
stiff 1
Peculiar 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
very 1
word 1
said 1
Holmes 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
an 1
English 1
paper 1
at 1
all 1
Hold 1
it 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
light 1
I 1
did 1
so 1
and 1
saw 1
a 1
large 1
E 1
with 1
a 1
small 1
g 1
a 1
P 1
and 1
a 1
large 1
G 1

a 1

woven 1
into 1
the 1
texture 1
of 1
the 1

What 1
do 1
you 1
make 1
of 1
that 1
asked 1
Holmes 1
The 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
maker 1
no 1
doubt 1
or 1
his 1
monogram 1
rather 1
Not 1
at 1
all 1
The 1
G 1
with 1
the 1
small 1
t 1
stands 1
for 1
Gesellschaft 1
which 1
is 1
the 1
German 1

Company 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
customary 1
contraction 1

Let 1

at 1
our 1

He 1
took 1
down 1
a 1
heavy 1
brown 1
volume 1
from 1
his 1
shelves 1
Eglow 1
Eglonitz 1
here 1
we 1
are 1
Egria 1
It 1
is 1
in 1
a 1
German 1
speaking 1
country 1
in 1
Bohemia 1
not 1
far 1
from 1
Carlsbad 1
Remarkable 1
as 1
being 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
Wallenstein 1
and 1
for 1
its 1
numerous 1
glass 1
factories 1
and 1
paper 1
mills 1
Ha 1
ha 1
my 1
boy 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
make 1
of 1
that 1
His 1
eyes 1
sparkled 1
and 1
he 1
sent 1
up 1
a 1
great 1
blue 1
triumphant 1
cloud 1
from 1
his 1
cigarette 1
The 1
paper 1
was 1
made 1
in 1
Bohemia 1
I 1
said 1
Precisely 1
And 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
wrote 1
the 1
note 1
is 1
a 1
German 1
Do 1
you 1
note 1
the 1
peculiar 1
construction 1
of 1
the 1
sentence 1
This 1
account 1
of 1
you 1
we 1
have 1
from 1
all 1
quarters 1
received 1
A 1
Frenchman 1
or 1
Russian 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
written 1
that 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
German 1
who 1
is 1
so 1
uncourteous 1
to 1
his 1
verbs 1
It 1
only 1
remains 1
therefore 1
to 1
discover 1
what 1
is 1
wanted 1
by 1
this 1
German 1
who 1
writes 1
upon 1
Bohemian 1
paper 1
and 1
prefers 1
wearing 1
a 1
mask 1
to 1
showing 1
his 1
face 1
And 1
here 1
he 1
comes 1
if 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
mistaken 1
to 1
resolve 1
all 1
our 1
doubts 1
As 1
he 1
spoke 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
sharp 1
sound 1
of 1
horses 1
hoofs 1
and 1
grating 1
wheels 1
against 1
the 1
curb 1
followed 1
by 1
a 1
sharp 1
pull 1
at 1
the 1
bell 1
Holmes 1
whistled 1
A 1
pair 1
by 1
the 1
sound 1
said 1
he 1
Yes 1
he 1
continued 1
glancing 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
A 1
nice 1
little 1
brougham 1
and 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
beauties 1
A 1
hundred 1
and 1
fifty 1
guineas 1
apiece 1
There 1
s 1
money 1
in 1
this 1
case 1
Watson 1
if 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
else 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
better 1
go 1
Holmes 1
Not 1
a 1
bit 1
Doctor 1
Stay 1
where 1
you 1
are 1
I 1
am 1
lost 1
without 1
my 1
Boswell 1
And 1
this 1
promises 1
to 1
be 1
interesting 1
It 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
pity 1
to 1
miss 1
it 1
But 1
your 1
client 1
Never 1
mind 1
him 1
I 1
may 1
want 1
your 1
help 1
and 1
so 1
may 1
he 1
Here 1
he 1
comes 1
Sit 1
down 1
in 1
that 1
armchair 1
Doctor 1
and 1
give 1
us 1
your 1
best 1
attention 1
A 1
slow 1
and 1
heavy 1
step 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
heard 1
upon 1
the 1
stairs 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
passage 1
paused 1
immediately 1
outside 1
the 1
door 1
Then 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
loud 1
and 1
authoritative 1
tap 1
Come 1
in 1
said 1
Holmes 1
A 1
man 1
entered 1
who 1
could 1
hardly 1
have 1
been 1
less 1
than 1
six 1
feet 1
six 1
inches 1
in 1
height 1
with 1
the 1
chest 1
and 1
limbs 1
of 1
a 1
Hercules 1
His 1
dress 1
was 1
rich 1
with 1
a 1
richness 1
which 1
would 1
in 1
England 1
be 1
looked 1
upon 1
as 1
akin 1
to 1
bad 1
taste 1
Heavy 1
bands 1
of 1
astrakhan 1
were 1
slashed 1
across 1
the 1
sleeves 1
and 1
fronts 1
of 1
his 1
double 1
breasted 1
coat 1
while 1
the 1
deep 1
blue 1
cloak 1
which 1
was 1
thrown 1
over 1
his 1
shoulders 1
was 1
lined 1
with 1
flame 1
coloured 1
silk 1
and 1
secured 1
at 1
the 1
neck 1
with 1
a 1
brooch 1
which 1
consisted 1
of 1
a 1
single 1
flaming 1
beryl 1
Boots 1
which 1
extended 1
halfway 1
up 1
his 1
calves 1
and 1
which 1
were 1
trimmed 1
at 1
the 1
tops 1
with 1
rich 1
brown 1
fur 1
completed 1
the 1
impression 1
of 1
barbaric 1
opulence 1
which 1
was 1
suggested 1
by 1
his 1
whole 1
appearance 1
He 1
carried 1
a 1
broad 1
brimmed 1
hat 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
while 1
he 1
wore 1
across 1
the 1
upper 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
face 1
extending 1
down 1
past 1
the 1
cheekbones 1
a 1
black 1
vizard 1
mask 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
apparently 1
adjusted 1
that 1
very 1
moment 1
for 1
his 1
hand 1
was 1
still 1
raised 1
to 1
it 1
as 1
he 1
entered 1
From 1
the 1
lower 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
face 1
he 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
strong 1
character 1
with 1
a 1
thick 1
hanging 1
lip 1
and 1
a 1
long 1
straight 1
chin 1
suggestive 1
of 1
resolution 1
pushed 1
to 1
the 1
length 1
of 1
obstinacy 1
You 1
had 1
my 1
note 1
he 1
asked 1
with 1
a 1
deep 1
harsh 1
voice 1
and 1
a 1
strongly 1
marked 1
German 1
accent 1
I 1
told 1
you 1
that 1
I 1
would 1
call 1
He 1
looked 1
from 1
one 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
of 1
us 1
as 1
if 1
uncertain 1
which 1
to 1
address 1
Pray 1
take 1
a 1
seat 1
said 1
Holmes 1
This 1
is 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
colleague 1
Dr 1
Watson 1
who 1
is 1
occasionally 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
help 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
cases 1
Whom 1
have 1
I 1
the 1
honour 1
to 1
address 1
You 1
may 1
address 1
me 1
as 1
the 1
Count 1
Von 1
Kramm 1
a 1
Bohemian 1
nobleman 1
I 1
understand 1
that 1
this 1
gentleman 1
your 1
friend 1
is 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
honour 1
and 1
discretion 1
whom 1
I 1
may 1
trust 1
with 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
extreme 1
importance 1
If 1
not 1
I 1
should 1
much 1
prefer 1
to 1
communicate 1
with 1
you 1
alone 1
I 1
rose 1
to 1
go 1
but 1
Holmes 1
caught 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
wrist 1
and 1
pushed 1
me 1
back 1
into 1
my 1
chair 1
It 1
is 1
both 1
or 1
none 1
said 1
he 1
You 1
may 1
say 1
before 1
this 1
gentleman 1
anything 1
which 1
you 1
may 1
say 1
to 1
me 1
The 1
Count 1
shrugged 1
his 1
broad 1
shoulders 1
Then 1
I 1
must 1
begin 1
said 1
he 1
by 1
binding 1
you 1
both 1
to 1
absolute 1
secrecy 1
for 1
two 1
years 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
that 1
time 1
the 1
matter 1
will 1
be 1
of 1
no 1
importance 1
At 1
present 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
too 1
much 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
of 1
such 1
weight 1
it 1
may 1
have 1
an 1
influence 1
upon 1
European 1
history 1
I 1
promise 1
said 1
Holmes 1
And 1
I 1
You 1
will 1
excuse 1
this 1
mask 1
continued 1
our 1
strange 1
visitor 1
The 1
august 1
person 1
who 1
employs 1
me 1
wishes 1
his 1
agent 1
to 1
be 1
unknown 1
to 1
you 1
and 1
I 1
may 1
confess 1
at 1
once 1
that 1
the 1
title 1
by 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
just 1
called 1
myself 1
is 1
not 1
exactly 1
my 1
own 1
I 1
was 1
aware 1
of 1
it 1
said 1
Holmes 1
dryly 1
The 1
circumstances 1
are 1
of 1
great 1
delicacy 1
and 1
every 1
precaution 1
has 1
to 1
be 1
taken 1
to 1
quench 1
what 1
might 1
grow 1
to 1
be 1
an 1
immense 1
scandal 1
and 1
seriously 1
compromise 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
reigning 1
families 1
of 1
Europe 1
To 1
speak 1
plainly 1
the 1
matter 1
implicates 1
the 1
great 1
House 1
of 1
Ormstein 1
hereditary 1
kings 1
of 1
Bohemia 1
I 1
was 1
also 1
aware 1
of 1
that 1
murmured 1
Holmes 1
settling 1
himself 1
down 1
in 1
his 1
armchair 1
and 1
closing 1
his 1
eyes 1
Our 1
visitor 1
glanced 1
with 1
some 1
apparent 1
surprise 1
at 1
the 1
languid 1
lounging 1
figure 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
no 1
doubt 1
depicted 1
to 1
him 1
as 1
the 1
most 1
incisive 1
reasoner 1
and 1
most 1
energetic 1
agent 1
in 1
Europe 1
Holmes 1
slowly 1
reopened 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
looked 1
impatiently 1
at 1
his 1
gigantic 1
client 1
If 1
your 1
Majesty 1
would 1
condescend 1
to 1
state 1
your 1
case 1
he 1
remarked 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
better 1
able 1
to 1
advise 1
you 1
The 1
man 1
sprang 1
from 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
paced 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
uncontrollable 1
agitation 1
Then 1
with 1
a 1
gesture 1
of 1
desperation 1
he 1
tore 1
the 1
mask 1
from 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
hurled 1
it 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
You 1
are 1
right 1
he 1
cried 1
I 1
am 1
the 1
King 1
Why 1
should 1
I 1
attempt 1
to 1
conceal 1
it 1
Why 1
indeed 1
murmured 1
Holmes 1
Your 1
Majesty 1
had 1
not 1
spoken 1
before 1
I 1
was 1
aware 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
addressing 1
Wilhelm 1
Gottsreich 1
Sigismond 1
von 1
Ormstein 1
Grand 1
Duke 1
of 1
Cassel 1
Felstein 1
and 1
hereditary 1
King 1
of 1
Bohemia 1
But 1
you 1
can 1
understand 1
said 1
our 1
strange 1
visitor 1
sitting 1
down 1
once 1
more 1
and 1
passing 1
his 1
hand 1
over 1
his 1
high 1
white 1
forehead 1
you 1
can 1
understand 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
accustomed 1
to 1
doing 1
such 1
business 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
person 1
Yet 1
the 1
matter 1
was 1
so 1
delicate 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
confide 1
it 1
to 1
an 1
agent 1
without 1
putting 1
myself 1
in 1
his 1
power 1
I 1
have 1
come 1
incognito 1
from 1
Prague 1
for 1
the 1
purpose 1
of 1
consulting 1
you 1
Then 1
pray 1
consult 1
said 1
Holmes 1
shutting 1
his 1
eyes 1
once 1
more 1
The 1
facts 1
are 1
briefly 1
these 1
Some 1
five 1
years 1
ago 1
during 1
a 1
lengthy 1
visit 1
to 1
Warsaw 1
I 1
made 1
the 1
acquaintance 1
of 1
the 1
well 1
known 1
adventuress 1
Irene 1
Adler 1
The 1
name 1
is 1
no 1
doubt 1
familiar 1
to 1
you 1
Kindly 1
look 1
her 1
up 1
in 1
my 1
index 1
Doctor 1
murmured 1
Holmes 1
without 1
opening 1
his 1
eyes 1
For 1
many 1
years 1
he 1
had 1
adopted 1
a 1
system 1
of 1
docketing 1
all 1
paragraphs 1
concerning 1
men 1
and 1
things 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
difficult 1
to 1
name 1
a 1
subject 1
or 1
a 1
person 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
at 1
once 1
furnish 1
information 1
In 1
this 1
case 1
I 1
found 1
her 1
biography 1
sandwiched 1
in 1
between 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
Hebrew 1
rabbi 1
and 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
staff 1
commander 1
who 1
had 1
written 1
a 1
monograph 1
upon 1
the 1
deep 1
sea 1
fishes 1
Let 1
me 1
see 1
said 1
Holmes 1
Hum 1

Retired 1
from 1

stage 1
ha 1
Living 1
in 1
London 1
quite 1
so 1
Your 1
Majesty 1
as 1
I 1
understand 1
became 1
entangled 1
with 1
this 1
young 1
person 1
wrote 1
her 1
some 1
compromising 1
letters 1
and 1
is 1
now 1
desirous 1
of 1
getting 1
those 1
letters 1
back 1
Precisely 1
so 1
But 1
how 1
Was 1
there 1
a 1
secret 1
marriage 1
None 1
No 1
legal 1
papers 1
or 1
certificates 1
None 1
Then 1
I 1
fail 1
to 1
follow 1
your 1
Majesty 1
If 1
this 1
young 1
person 1
should 1
produce 1
her 1
letters 1
for 1
blackmailing 1
or 1
other 1
purposes 1
how 1
is 1
she 1
to 1
prove 1
their 1
authenticity 1
There 1
is 1
the 1
writing 1

Bought 1
We 1
were 1
both 1
in 1
the 1

Oh 1
dear 1
That 1
is 1
very 1
bad 1
Your 1
Majesty 1
has 1
indeed 1
committed 1
an 1
indiscretion 1
I 1
was 1
mad 1
insane 1
You 1
have 1
compromised 1
yourself 1
seriously 1
I 1
was 1
only 1
Crown 1
Prince 1
then 1
I 1
was 1
young 1
I 1
am 1
but 1
thirty 1
now 1
It 1
must 1
be 1
recovered 1
We 1
have 1
tried 1
and 1
failed 1
Your 1
Majesty 1
must 1
pay 1
It 1
must 1
be 1
bought 1
She 1
will 1
not 1
sell 1
Stolen 1
then 1
Five 1
attempts 1
have 1
been 1
made 1
Twice 1
burglars 1
in 1
my 1

ransacked 1
her 1

Once 1
we 1
diverted 1
her 1
luggage 1
when 1
she 1
travelled 1
Twice 1
she 1
has 1
been 1
waylaid 1
There 1
has 1
been 1
no 1
result 1
No 1
sign 1
of 1
it 1
Absolutely 1
none 1
Holmes 1
laughed 1
It 1
is 1
quite 1
a 1
pretty 1
little 1
problem 1
said 1
he 1
But 1
a 1
very 1
serious 1
one 1
to 1
me 1
returned 1
the 1
King 1
reproachfully 1
Very 1
indeed 1
And 1
what 1
does 1
she 1
propose 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
the 1
photograph 1
To 1
ruin 1
me 1
But 1
how 1
I 1
am 1
about 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
So 1
I 1
have 1
heard 1
To 1
Clotilde 1
Lothman 1
von 1
Saxe 1
Meningen 1
second 1
daughter 1
of 1
the 1
King 1
of 1
Scandinavia 1
You 1
may 1
know 1
the 1
strict 1
principles 1
of 1
her 1
family 1
She 1
is 1
herself 1
the 1
very 1
soul 1
of 1
delicacy 1
A 1
shadow 1
of 1
a 1
doubt 1
as 1
to 1
my 1
conduct 1
would 1
bring 1
the 1
matter 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
And 1
Irene 1
Adler 1
Threatens 1
to 1
send 1
them 1
the 1
photograph 1
And 1
she 1
will 1
do 1
it 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
she 1
will 1
do 1
it 1
You 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
her 1
but 1
she 1
has 1
a 1
soul 1
of 1
steel 1
She 1
has 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
of 1
women 1
and 1
the 1
mind 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
resolute 1
of 1
men 1
Rather 1
than 1
I 1
should 1
marry 1
another 1
woman 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
lengths 1
to 1
which 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
go 1
none 1
You 1
are 1
sure 1
that 1
she 1
has 1
not 1
sent 1
it 1
yet 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
And 1
why 1
Because 1
she 1
has 1
said 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
send 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
day 1
when 1
the 1
betrothal 1
was 1
publicly 1
proclaimed 1
That 1
will 1
be 1
next 1
Monday 1
Oh 1
then 1
we 1
have 1
three 1
days 1
yet 1
said 1
Holmes 1
with 1
a 1
yawn 1
That 1
is 1
very 1
fortunate 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
matters 1
of 1
importance 1
to 1
look 1
into 1
just 1
at 1
present 1
Your 1
Majesty 1
will 1
of 1
course 1
stay 1
in 1
London 1
for 1
the 1
present 1
Certainly 1
You 1
will 1
find 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
Langham 1
under 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
Count 1
Von 1
Kramm 1
Then 1
I 1
shall 1
drop 1
you 1
a 1
line 1
to 1
let 1
you 1
know 1
how 1
we 1
progress 1
Pray 1
do 1
so 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
all 1
anxiety 1
Then 1
as 1
to 1
money 1
You 1
have 1
carte 1
blanche 1
Absolutely 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
I 1
would 1
give 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
provinces 1
of 1
my 1
kingdom 1
to 1
have 1
that 1
photograph 1
And 1
for 1
present 1
expenses 1
The 1
King 1
took 1
a 1
heavy 1
chamois 1
leather 1
bag 1
from 1
under 1
his 1
cloak 1
and 1
laid 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
There 1
are 1
three 1
hundred 1
pounds 1
in 1
gold 1
and 1
seven 1
hundred 1
in 1
notes 1
he 1
said 1
Holmes 1
scribbled 1
a 1
receipt 1
upon 1
a 1
sheet 1
of 1
his 1
note 1
book 1
and 1
handed 1
it 1
to 1
him 1
And 1
Mademoiselle 1
s 1
address 1
he 1
asked 1
Is 1
Briony 1
Lodge 1
Serpentine 1
Avenue 1
St 1
John 1
s 1
Wood 1
Holmes 1
took 1
a 1
note 1
of 1
it 1
One 1
other 1
question 1
said 1
he 1
Was 1
the 1
photograph 1
a 1
cabinet 1
It 1
was 1
Then 1
good 1
night 1
your 1
Majesty 1
and 1
I 1
trust 1
that 1
we 1
shall 1
soon 1
have 1
some 1
good 1
news 1
for 1
you 1
And 1
good 1
night 1
Watson 1
he 1
added 1
as 1
the 1
wheels 1
of 1
the 1
royal 1
brougham 1
rolled 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
If 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
call 1
to 1
morrow 1
afternoon 1
at 1
three 1
o 1
clock 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
chat 1
this 1
little 1
matter 1
over 1
with 1
you 1
II 1
At 1
three 1
o 1
clock 1
precisely 1
I 1
was 1
at 1
Baker 1
Street 1
but 1
Holmes 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
returned 1
The 1
landlady 1
informed 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
the 1
house 1
shortly 1
after 1
eight 1
o 1
clock 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
I 1
sat 1
down 1
beside 1
the 1
fire 1
however 1
with 1
the 1
intention 1
of 1
awaiting 1
him 1
however 1
long 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
I 1
was 1
already 1
deeply 1
interested 1
in 1
his 1
inquiry 1
for 1
though 1
it 1
was 1
surrounded 1
by 1
none 1
of 1
the 1
grim 1
and 1
strange 1
features 1
which 1
were 1
associated 1
with 1
the 1
two 1
crimes 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
already 1
recorded 1
still 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
case 1
and 1
the 1
exalted 1
station 1
of 1
his 1
client 1
gave 1
it 1
a 1
character 1
of 1
its 1
own 1
Indeed 1
apart 1
from 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
investigation 1
which 1
my 1
friend 1
had 1
on 1
hand 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
his 1
masterly 1
grasp 1
of 1
a 1
situation 1
and 1
his 1
keen 1
incisive 1
reasoning 1
which 1
made 1
it 1
a 1
pleasure 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
study 1
his 1
system 1
of 1
work 1
and 1
to 1
follow 1
the 1
quick 1
subtle 1
methods 1
by 1
which 1
he 1
disentangled 1
the 1
most 1
inextricable 1
mysteries 1
So 1
accustomed 1
was 1
I 1
to 1
his 1
invariable 1
success 1
that 1
the 1
very 1
possibility 1
of 1
his 1
failing 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
enter 1
into 1
my 1
head 1
It 1
was 1
close 1
upon 1
four 1
before 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
a 1
drunken 1
looking 1
groom 1
ill 1
kempt 1
and 1
side 1
whiskered 1
with 1
an 1
inflamed 1
face 1
and 1
disreputable 1
clothes 1
walked 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
Accustomed 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
to 1
my 1
friend 1
s 1
amazing 1
powers 1
in 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
disguises 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
look 1
three 1
times 1
before 1
I 1
was 1
certain 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
indeed 1
he 1
With 1
a 1
nod 1
he 1
vanished 1
into 1
the 1
bedroom 1
whence 1
he 1
emerged 1
in 1
five 1
minutes 1
tweed 1
suited 1
and 1
respectable 1
as 1
of 1
old 1
Putting 1
his 1
hands 1
into 1
his 1
pockets 1
he 1
stretched 1
out 1
his 1
legs 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
laughed 1
heartily 1
for 1
some 1
minutes 1
Well 1
really 1
he 1
cried 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
choked 1
and 1
laughed 1
again 1
until 1
he 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
lie 1
back 1
limp 1
and 1
helpless 1
in 1
the 1
chair 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
It 1
s 1
quite 1
too 1
funny 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
you 1
could 1
never 1
guess 1
how 1
I 1
employed 1
my 1
morning 1
or 1
what 1
I 1
ended 1
by 1
doing 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
imagine 1
I 1
suppose 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
watching 1
the 1
habits 1
and 1
perhaps 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
Miss 1
Irene 1
Adler 1
Quite 1
so 1
but 1
the 1
sequel 1
was 1
rather 1
unusual 1
I 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
however 1
I 1
left 1
the 1
house 1
a 1
little 1
after 1
eight 1
o 1
clock 1
this 1
morning 1
in 1
the 1
character 1
of 1
a 1
groom 1
out 1
of 1
work 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
wonderful 1
sympathy 1
and 1
freemasonry 1
among 1
horsey 1
men 1
Be 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
know 1
all 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
to 1
know 1
I 1
soon 1
found 1
Briony 1
Lodge 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
bijou 1
villa 1
with 1
a 1
garden 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
but 1
built 1
out 1
in 1
front 1
right 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
road 1
two 1
stories 1
Chubb 1
lock 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
Large 1
sitting 1
room 1
on 1
the 1
right 1
side 1
well 1
furnished 1
with 1
long 1
windows 1
almost 1
to 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
those 1
preposterous 1
English 1
window 1
fasteners 1
which 1
a 1
child 1
could 1
open 1
Behind 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
remarkable 1
save 1
that 1
the 1
passage 1
window 1
could 1
be 1
reached 1
from 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
coach 1
house 1
I 1
walked 1
round 1
it 1
and 1
examined 1
it 1
closely 1
from 1
every 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
but 1
without 1
noting 1
anything 1
else 1
of 1
interest 1
I 1
then 1
lounged 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
and 1
found 1
as 1
I 1
expected 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
mews 1
in 1
a 1
lane 1
which 1
runs 1
down 1
by 1
one 1
wall 1
of 1
the 1
garden 1
I 1
lent 1
the 1
ostlers 1
a 1
hand 1
in 1
rubbing 1
down 1
their 1
horses 1
and 1
received 1
in 1
exchange 1
twopence 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
half 1
and 1
half 1
two 1
fills 1
of 1
shag 1
tobacco 1
and 1
as 1
much 1
information 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
desire 1
about 1
Miss 1
Adler 1
to 1
say 1
nothing 1
of 1
half 1
a 1
dozen 1
other 1
people 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
in 1
whom 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
interested 1
but 1
whose 1
biographies 1
I 1
was 1
compelled 1
to 1
listen 1
to 1
And 1
what 1
of 1
Irene 1
Adler 1
I 1
asked 1
Oh 1
she 1
has 1
turned 1
all 1
the 1
men 1
s 1
heads 1
down 1
in 1
that 1
part 1
She 1
is 1
the 1
daintiest 1
thing 1
under 1
a 1
bonnet 1
on 1
this 1
planet 1
So 1
say 1
the 1
Serpentine 1
mews 1
to 1
a 1
man 1
She 1
lives 1
quietly 1
sings 1
at 1
concerts 1
drives 1
out 1
at 1
five 1
every 1
day 1
and 1
returns 1
at 1
seven 1
sharp 1
for 1
dinner 1
Seldom 1
goes 1
out 1
at 1
other 1
times 1
except 1
when 1
she 1
sings 1
Has 1
only 1
one 1
male 1
visitor 1
but 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
of 1
him 1
He 1
is 1
dark 1
handsome 1
and 1
dashing 1
never 1
calls 1
less 1
than 1
once 1
a 1
day 1
and 1
often 1
twice 1
He 1
is 1
a 1
Mr 1
Godfrey 1
Norton 1
of 1
the 1
Inner 1
Temple 1
See 1
the 1
advantages 1
of 1
a 1
cabman 1
as 1
a 1
confidant 1
They 1
had 1
driven 1
him 1
home 1
a 1
dozen 1
times 1
from 1
Serpentine 1
mews 1
and 1
knew 1
all 1
about 1
him 1
When 1
I 1
had 1
listened 1
to 1
all 1
they 1
had 1
to 1
tell 1
I 1
began 1
to 1
walk 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
near 1
Briony 1
Lodge 1
once 1
more 1
and 1
to 1
think 1
over 1
my 1
plan 1
of 1
campaign 1
This 1
Godfrey 1
Norton 1
was 1
evidently 1
an 1
important 1
factor 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
lawyer 1
That 1
sounded 1
ominous 1
What 1
was 1
the 1
relation 1
between 1
them 1
and 1
what 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
his 1
repeated 1
visits 1
Was 1
she 1
his 1
client 1
his 1
friend 1
or 1
his 1
mistress 1
If 1
the 1
former 1
she 1
had 1
probably 1
transferred 1
the 1
photograph 1
to 1
his 1
keeping 1
If 1
the 1
latter 1
it 1
was 1
less 1
likely 1
On 1
the 1
issue 1
of 1
this 1
question 1
depended 1
whether 1
I 1
should 1
continue 1
my 1
work 1
at 1
Briony 1
Lodge 1
or 1
turn 1
my 1
attention 1
to 1
the 1
gentleman 1
s 1
chambers 1
in 1
the 1
Temple 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
delicate 1
point 1
and 1
it 1
widened 1
the 1
field 1
of 1
my 1
inquiry 1
I 1
fear 1
that 1
I 1
bore 1
you 1
with 1
these 1
details 1
but 1
I 1
have 1
to 1
let 1
you 1
see 1
my 1
little 1
difficulties 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
to 1
understand 1
the 1
situation 1
I 1
am 1
following 1
you 1
closely 1
I 1
answered 1
I 1
was 1
still 1
balancing 1
the 1
matter 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
when 1
a 1
hansom 1
cab 1
drove 1
up 1
to 1
Briony 1
Lodge 1
and 1
a 1
gentleman 1
sprang 1
out 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
remarkably 1
handsome 1
man 1
dark 1
aquiline 1
and 1
moustached 1
evidently 1
the 1
man 1
of 1
whom 1
I 1
had 1
heard 1
He 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
a 1
great 1
hurry 1
shouted 1
to 1
the 1
cabman 1
to 1
wait 1
and 1
brushed 1
past 1
the 1
maid 1
who 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
the 1
air 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
thoroughly 1
at 1
home 1
He 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
about 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
and 1
I 1
could 1
catch 1
glimpses 1
of 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
windows 1
of 1
the 1
sitting 1
room 1
pacing 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
talking 1
excitedly 1
and 1
waving 1
his 1
arms 1
Of 1
her 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
nothing 1
Presently 1
he 1
emerged 1
looking 1
even 1
more 1
flurried 1
than 1
before 1
As 1
he 1
stepped 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
cab 1
he 1
pulled 1
a 1
gold 1
watch 1
from 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
it 1
earnestly 1
Drive 1
like 1
the 1
devil 1
he 1
shouted 1
first 1
to 1
Gross 1
Hankey 1
s 1
in 1
Regent 1
Street 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
the 1
Church 1
of 1
St 1
Monica 1
in 1
the 1
Edgeware 1
Road 1
Half 1
a 1
guinea 1
if 1
you 1
do 1
it 1
in 1
twenty 1
minutes 1
Away 1
they 1
went 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
just 1
wondering 1
whether 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
do 1
well 1
to 1
follow 1
them 1
when 1
up 1
the 1
lane 1
came 1
a 1
neat 1
little 1
landau 1
the 1
coachman 1
with 1
his 1
coat 1
only 1
half 1
buttoned 1
and 1
his 1
tie 1
under 1
his 1
ear 1
while 1
all 1
the 1
tags 1
of 1
his 1
harness 1
were 1
sticking 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
buckles 1
It 1
hadn 1
t 1
pulled 1
up 1
before 1
she 1
shot 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
door 1
and 1
into 1
it 1
I 1
only 1
caught 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
her 1
at 1
the 1
moment 1
but 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
lovely 1
woman 1
with 1
a 1
face 1
that 1
a 1
man 1
might 1
die 1
for 1
The 1
Church 1
of 1
St 1
Monica 1
John 1
she 1
cried 1
and 1
half 1
a 1
sovereign 1
if 1
you 1
reach 1
it 1
in 1
twenty 1
minutes 1
This 1
was 1
quite 1
too 1
good 1
to 1

I 1
was 1
just 1
balancing 1
whether 1
I 1
should 1
run 1
for 1
it 1
or 1
whether 1
I 1
should 1
perch 1
behind 1
her 1
landau 1
when 1
a 1
cab 1
came 1
through 1
the 1
street 1
The 1
driver 1
looked 1
twice 1
at 1
such 1
a 1
shabby 1
fare 1
but 1
I 1
jumped 1
in 1
before 1
he 1
could 1
object 1
The 1
Church 1
of 1
St 1
Monica 1
said 1
I 1
and 1
half 1
a 1
sovereign 1
if 1
you 1
reach 1
it 1
in 1
twenty 1
minutes 1
It 1
was 1
twenty 1
five 1
minutes 1
to 1
twelve 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
it 1
was 1
clear 1
enough 1
what 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
wind 1
My 1
cabby 1
drove 1
fast 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
I 1
ever 1
drove 1
faster 1
but 1
the 1
others 1
were 1
there 1
before 1
us 1
The 1
cab 1
and 1
the 1
landau 1
with 1
their 1
steaming 1
horses 1
were 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
when 1
I 1
arrived 1
I 1
paid 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
hurried 1
into 1
the 1
church 1
There 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
soul 1
there 1
save 1
the 1
two 1
whom 1
I 1
had 1
followed 1
and 1
a 1
surpliced 1
clergyman 1
who 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
expostulating 1
with 1
them 1
They 1
were 1
all 1
three 1
standing 1
in 1
a 1
knot 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
altar 1
I 1
lounged 1
up 1
the 1
side 1
aisle 1
like 1
any 1
other 1
idler 1
who 1
has 1
dropped 1
into 1
a 1
church 1
Suddenly 1
to 1
my 1
surprise 1
the 1
three 1
at 1
the 1
altar 1
faced 1
round 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
Godfrey 1
Norton 1
came 1
running 1
as 1
hard 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
towards 1
me 1
Thank 1
God 1
he 1
cried 1
You 1
ll 1
do 1
Come 2
What 1
then 1
I 1
asked 1
Come 1
man 1
come 1
only 1
three 1
minutes 1
or 1
it 1
won 1
t 1
be 1
legal 1
I 1
was 1
half 1
dragged 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
altar 1
and 1
before 1
I 1
knew 1
where 1
I 1
was 1
I 1
found 1
myself 1
mumbling 1
responses 1
which 1
were 1
whispered 1
in 1
my 1
ear 1
and 1
vouching 1
for 1
things 1
of 1
which 1
I 1
knew 1
nothing 1
and 1
generally 1
assisting 1
in 1
the 1
secure 1
tying 1
up 1
of 1
Irene 1
Adler 1
spinster 1
to 1
Godfrey 1
Norton 1
bachelor 1
It 1
was 1
all 1
done 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
gentleman 1
thanking 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
the 1
lady 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
while 1
the 1
clergyman 1
beamed 1
on 1
me 1
in 1
front 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
preposterous 1
position 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
ever 1
found 1
myself 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
it 1
that 1
started 1
me 1
laughing 1
just 1
now 1
It 1
seems 1
that 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
some 1
informality 1
about 1
their 1
license 1
that 1
the 1
clergyman 1
absolutely 1
refused 1
to 1
marry 1
them 1
without 1
a 1
witness 1
of 1
some 1
sort 1
and 1
that 1
my 1
lucky 1
appearance 1
saved 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
from 1
having 1
to 1
sally 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
streets 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
a 1
best 1
man 1
The 1
bride 1
gave 1
me 1
a 1
sovereign 1
and 1
I 1
mean 1
to 1
wear 1
it 1
on 1
my 1
watch 1
chain 1
in 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
occasion 1
This 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
unexpected 1
turn 1
of 1
affairs 1
said 1
I 1
and 1
what 1
then 1
Well 1
I 1
found 1
my 1
plans 1
very 1
seriously 1
menaced 1
It 1
looked 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
pair 1
might 1
take 1
an 1
immediate 1
departure 1
and 1
so 1
necessitate 1
very 1
prompt 1
and 1
energetic 1
measures 1
on 1
my 1
part 1
At 1
the 1
church 1
door 1
however 1
they 1
separated 1
he 1
driving 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
Temple 1
and 1
she 1
to 1
her 1
own 1
house 1
I 1
shall 1
drive 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
park 1
at 1
five 1
as 1
usual 1
she 1
said 1
as 1
she 1
left 1
him 1
I 1
heard 1
no 1
more 1
They 1
drove 1
away 1
in 1
different 1
directions 1
and 1
I 1
went 1
off 1
to 1
make 1
my 1
own 1
arrangements 1
Which 1
are 1
Some 1
cold 1
beef 1
and 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
beer 1
he 1
answered 1
ringing 1
the 1
bell 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
too 1
busy 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
food 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
likely 1
to 1
be 1
busier 1
still 1
this 1
evening 1
By 1
the 1
way 1
Doctor 1
I 1
shall 1
want 1
your 1
co 1
operation 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
delighted 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
mind 1
breaking 1
the 1
law 1
Not 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
Nor 1
running 1
a 1
chance 1
of 1
arrest 1
Not 1
in 1
a 1
good 1
cause 1
Oh 1
the 1
cause 1
is 1
excellent 1
Then 1
I 1
am 1
your 1
man 1
I 1
was 1
sure 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
rely 1
on 1
you 1
But 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
you 1
wish 1
When 1
Mrs 1
Turner 1
has 1
brought 1
in 1
the 1
tray 1
I 1
will 1
make 1
it 1
clear 1
to 1
you 1
Now 1
he 1
said 1
as 1
he 1
turned 1
hungrily 1
on 1
the 1
simple 1
fare 1
that 1
our 1
landlady 1
had 1
provided 1
I 1
must 1
discuss 1
it 1
while 1
I 1
eat 1
for 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
much 1
time 1
It 1
is 1
nearly 1
five 1
now 1
In 1
two 1
hours 1
we 1
must 1
be 1
on 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
action 1
Miss 1
Irene 1
or 1
Madame 1
rather 1
returns 1
from 1
her 1
drive 1
at 1
seven 1
We 1
must 1
be 1
at 1
Briony 1
Lodge 1
to 1
meet 1
her 1
And 1
what 1
then 1
You 1
must 1
leave 1
that 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
have 1
already 1
arranged 1
what 1
is 1
to 1
occur 1
There 1
is 1
only 1
one 1
point 1
on 1
which 1
I 1
must 1
insist 1
You 1
must 1
not 1
interfere 1
come 1
what 1
may 1
You 1
understand 1
I 1
am 1
to 1
be 1
neutral 1
To 1
do 1
nothing 1
whatever 1
There 1
will 1
probably 1
be 1
some 1
small 1
unpleasantness 1
Do 1
not 1
join 1
in 1
it 1
It 1
will 1
end 1
in 1
my 1
being 1
conveyed 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
Four 1
or 1
five 1
minutes 1
afterwards 1
the 1
sitting 1
room 1
window 1
will 1
open 1
You 1
are 1
to 1
station 1
yourself 1
close 1
to 1
that 1
open 1
window 1
Yes 1
You 1
are 1
to 1
watch 1
me 1
for 1
I 1
will 1
be 1
visible 1
to 1
you 1
Yes 1
And 1
when 1
I 1
raise 1
my 1
hand 1
so 1
you 1
will 1
throw 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
what 1
I 1
give 1
you 1
to 1
throw 1
and 1
will 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
raise 1
the 1
cry 1
of 1
fire 1
You 1
quite 1
follow 1
me 1
Entirely 1
It 1
is 1
nothing 1
very 1
formidable 1
he 1
said 1
taking 1
a 1
long 1
cigar 1
shaped 1
roll 1
from 1
his 1
pocket 1
It 1
is 1
an 1
ordinary 1
plumber 1
s 1
smoke 1
rocket 1
fitted 1
with 1
a 1
cap 1
at 1
either 1
end 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
self 1
lighting 1
Your 1
task 1
is 1
confined 1
to 1
that 1
When 1
you 1
raise 1
your 1
cry 1
of 1
fire 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
taken 1
up 1
by 1
quite 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
people 1
You 1
may 1
then 1
walk 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
rejoin 1
you 1
in 1
ten 1
minutes 1
I 1
hope 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
made 1
myself 1
clear 1
I 1
am 1
to 1
remain 1
neutral 1
to 1
get 1
near 1
the 1
window 1
to 1
watch 1
you 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
signal 1
to 1
throw 1
in 1
this 1
object 1
then 1
to 1
raise 1
the 1
cry 1
of 1
fire 1
and 1
to 1
wait 1
you 1
at 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
Precisely 1
Then 1
you 1
may 1
entirely 1
rely 1
on 1
me 1
That 1
is 1
excellent 1
I 1
think 1
perhaps 1
it 1
is 1
almost 1
time 1
that 1
I 1
prepare 1
for 1
the 1
new 1
role 1
I 1
have 1
to 1
play 1
He 1
disappeared 1
into 1
his 1
bedroom 1
and 1
returned 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
in 1
the 1
character 1
of 1
an 1
amiable 1
and 1
simple 1
minded 1
Nonconformist 1
clergyman 1
His 1
broad 1
black 1
hat 1
his 1
baggy 1
trousers 1
his 1
white 1
tie 1
his 1
sympathetic 1
smile 1
and 1
general 1
look 1
of 1
peering 1
and 1
benevolent 1
curiosity 1
were 1
such 1
as 1
Mr 1
John 1
Hare 1
alone 1
could 1
have 1
equalled 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
merely 1
that 1
Holmes 1
changed 1
his 1
costume 1
His 1
expression 1
his 1
manner 1
his 1
very 1
soul 1
seemed 1
to 1
vary 1
with 1
every 1
fresh 1
part 1
that 1
he 1
assumed 1
The 1
stage 1
lost 1
a 1
fine 1
actor 1
even 1
as 1
science 1
lost 1
an 1
acute 1
reasoner 1
when 1
he 1
became 1
a 1
specialist 1
in 1
crime 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
quarter 1
past 1
six 1
when 1
we 1
left 1
Baker 1
Street 1
and 1
it 1
still 1
wanted 1
ten 1
minutes 1
to 1
the 1
hour 1
when 1
we 1
found 1
ourselves 1
in 1
Serpentine 1
Avenue 1
It 1
was 1
already 1
dusk 1
and 1
the 1
lamps 1
were 1
just 1
being 1
lighted 1
as 1
we 1
paced 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
Briony 1
Lodge 1
waiting 1
for 1
the 1
coming 1
of 1
its 1
occupant 1
The 1
house 1
was 1
just 1
such 1
as 1
I 1
had 1
pictured 1
it 1
from 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
succinct 1
description 1
but 1
the 1
locality 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
less 1
private 1
than 1
I 1
expected 1
On 1
the 1
contrary 1
for 1
a 1
small 1
street 1
in 1
a 1
quiet 1
neighbourhood 1
it 1
was 1
remarkably 1
animated 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
group 1
of 1
shabbily 1
dressed 1
men 1
smoking 1
and 1
laughing 1
in 1
a 1
corner 1
a 1
scissors 1
grinder 1
with 1
his 1
wheel 1
two 1
guardsmen 1
who 1
were 1
flirting 1
with 1
a 1
nurse 1
girl 1
and 1
several 1
well 1
dressed 1
young 1
men 1
who 1
were 1
lounging 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
with 1
cigars 1
in 1
their 1
mouths 1
You 1
see 1
remarked 1
Holmes 1
as 1
we 1
paced 1
to 1
and 1
fro 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
this 1
marriage 1
rather 1
simplifies 1
matters 1
The 1
photograph 1
becomes 1
a 1
double 1
edged 1
weapon 1
now 1
The 1
chances 1
are 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
as 1
averse 1
to 1
its 1
being 1
seen 1
by 1
Mr 1
Godfrey 1
Norton 1
as 1
our 1
client 1
is 1
to 1
its 1
coming 1
to 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
his 1
princess 1
Now 1
the 1
question 1
is 1
Where 1
are 1
we 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
photograph 1
Where 1
indeed 1
It 1
is 1
most 1
unlikely 1
that 1
she 1
carries 1
it 1
about 1
with 1
her 1
It 1
is 1
cabinet 1
size 1
Too 1
large 1
for 1
easy 1
concealment 1
about 1
a 1
woman 1
s 1
dress 1
She 1
knows 1
that 1
the 1
King 1
is 1
capable 1
of 1
having 1
her 1
waylaid 1
and 1
searched 1
Two 1
attempts 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
have 1
already 1
been 1
made 1
We 1
may 1
take 1
it 1
then 1
that 1
she 1
does 1
not 1
carry 1
it 1
about 1
with 1
her 1
Where 1
then 1
Her 1
banker 1
or 1
her 1
lawyer 1
There 1
is 1
that 1
double 1
possibility 1
But 1
I 1
am 1
inclined 1
to 1
think 1
neither 1
Women 1
are 1
naturally 1
secretive 1
and 1
they 1
like 1
to 1
do 1
their 1
own 1
secreting 1
Why 1
should 1
she 1
hand 1
it 1
over 1
to 1
anyone 1
else 1
She 1
could 1
trust 1
her 1
own 1
guardianship 1
but 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
tell 1
what 1
indirect 1
or 1
political 1
influence 1
might 1
be 1
brought 1
to 1
bear 1
upon 1
a 1
business 1
man 1
Besides 1
remember 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
resolved 1
to 1
use 1
it 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
It 1
must 1
be 1
where 1
she 1
can 1
lay 1
her 1
hands 1
upon 1
it 1
It 1
must 1
be 1
in 1
her 1
own 1
house 1
But 1
it 1
has 1
twice 1
been 1
burgled 1
Pshaw 1
They 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
look 1
But 1
how 1
will 1
you 1
look 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
look 1
What 1
then 1
I 1
will 1
get 1
her 1
to 1
show 1
me 1
But 1
she 1
will 1
refuse 1
She 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
But 1
I 1
hear 1
the 1
rumble 1
of 1
wheels 1
It 1
is 1
her 1
carriage 1
Now 1
carry 1
out 1
my 1
orders 1
to 1
the 1
letter 1
As 1
he 1
spoke 1
the 1
gleam 1
of 1
the 1
side 1
lights 1
of 1
a 1
carriage 1
came 1
round 1
the 1
curve 1
of 1
the 1
avenue 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
smart 1
little 1
landau 1
which 1
rattled 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
Briony 1
Lodge 1
As 1
it 1
pulled 1
up 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
loafing 1
men 1
at 1
the 1
corner 1
dashed 1
forward 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
earning 1
a 1
copper 1
but 1
was 1
elbowed 1
away 1
by 1
another 1
loafer 1
who 1
had 1
rushed 1
up 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
intention 1
A 1
fierce 1
quarrel 1
broke 1
out 1
which 1
was 1
increased 1
by 1
the 1
two 1
guardsmen 1
who 1
took 1
sides 1
with 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
loungers 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
scissors 1
grinder 1
who 1
was 1
equally 1
hot 1
upon 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
A 1
blow 1
was 1
struck 1
and 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
the 1
lady 1
who 1
had 1
stepped 1
from 1
her 1
carriage 1
was 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
a 1
little 1
knot 1
of 1
flushed 1
and 1
struggling 1
men 1
who 1
struck 1
savagely 1
at 1
each 1
other 1
with 1
their 1
fists 1
and 1
sticks 1
Holmes 1
dashed 1
into 1
the 1
crowd 1
to 1
protect 1
the 1
lady 1
but 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
reached 1
her 1
he 1
gave 1
a 1
cry 1
and 1
dropped 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
with 1
the 1
blood 1
running 1
freely 1
down 1
his 1
face 1
At 1
his 1
fall 1
the 1
guardsmen 1
took 1
to 1
their 1
heels 1
in 1
one 1
direction 1
and 1
the 1
loungers 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
while 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
better 1
dressed 1
people 1
who 1
had 1
watched 1
the 1
scuffle 1
without 1
taking 1
part 1
in 1
it 1
crowded 1
in 1
to 1
help 1
the 1
lady 1
and 1
to 1
attend 1
to 1
the 1
injured 1
man 1
Irene 1
Adler 1
as 1
I 1
will 1
still 1
call 1
her 1
had 1
hurried 1
up 1
the 1
steps 1
but 1
she 1
stood 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
with 1
her 1
superb 1
figure 1
outlined 1
against 1
the 1
lights 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
looking 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
street 1
Is 1
the 1
poor 1
gentleman 1
much 1
hurt 1
she 1
asked 1
He 1
is 1
dead 1
cried 1
several 1
voices 1
No 1
no 1
there 1
s 1
life 1
in 1
him 1
shouted 1
another 1
But 1
he 1
ll 1
be 1
gone 1
before 1
you 1
can 1
get 1
him 1
to 1
hospital 1
He 1
s 1
a 1
brave 1
fellow 1
said 1
a 1
woman 1
They 1
would 1
have 1
had 1
the 1
lady 1
s 1
purse 1
and 1
watch 1
if 1
it 1
hadn 1
t 1
been 1
for 1
him 1
They 1
were 1
a 1
gang 1
and 1
a 1
rough 1
one 1
too 1
Ah 1
he 1
s 1
breathing 1
now 1
He 1
can 1
t 1
lie 1
in 1
the 1
street 1
May 1
we 1
bring 1
him 1
in 1
marm 1
Surely 1
Bring 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
sitting 1
room 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
comfortable 1
sofa 1
This 1
way 1
please 1
Slowly 1
and 1
solemnly 1
he 1
was 1
borne 1
into 1
Briony 1
Lodge 1
and 1
laid 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
principal 1
room 1
while 1
I 1
still 1
observed 1
the 1
proceedings 1
from 1
my 1
post 1
by 1
the 1
window 1
The 1
lamps 1
had 1
been 1
lit 1
but 1
the 1
blinds 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
drawn 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
Holmes 1
as 1
he 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
couch 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
whether 1
he 1
was 1
seized 1
with 1
compunction 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
for 1
the 1
part 1
he 1
was 1
playing 1
but 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
I 1
never 1
felt 1
more 1
heartily 1
ashamed 1
of 1
myself 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
than 1
when 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
beautiful 1
creature 1
against 1
whom 1
I 1
was 1
conspiring 1
or 1
the 1
grace 1
and 1
kindliness 1
with 1
which 1
she 1
waited 1
upon 1
the 1
injured 1
man 1
And 1
yet 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
blackest 1
treachery 1
to 1
Holmes 1
to 1
draw 1
back 1
now 1
from 1
the 1
part 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
intrusted 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
hardened 1
my 1
heart 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
smoke 1
rocket 1
from 1
under 1
my 1
ulster 1
After 1
all 1
I 1
thought 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
injuring 1
her 1
We 1
are 1
but 1
preventing 1
her 1
from 1
injuring 1
another 1
Holmes 1
had 1
sat 1
up 1
upon 1
the 1
couch 1
and 1
I 1
saw 1
him 1
motion 1
like 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
in 1
need 1
of 1
air 1
A 1
maid 1
rushed 1
across 1
and 1
threw 1
open 1
the 1
window 1
At 1
the 1
same 1
instant 1
I 1
saw 1
him 1
raise 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
signal 1
I 1
tossed 1
my 1
rocket 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
with 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
Fire 1
The 1
word 1
was 1
no 1
sooner 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
mouth 1
than 1
the 1
whole 1
crowd 1
of 1
spectators 1
well 1
dressed 1
and 1
ill 1
gentlemen 1
ostlers 1
and 1
servant 1
maids 1
joined 1
in 1
a 1
general 1
shriek 1
of 1
Fire 1
Thick 1
clouds 1
of 1
smoke 1
curled 1
through 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
open 1
window 1
I 1
caught 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
rushing 1
figures 1
and 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
Holmes 1
from 1
within 1
assuring 1
them 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
false 1
alarm 1
Slipping 1
through 1
the 1
shouting 1
crowd 1
I 1
made 1
my 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
and 1
in 1
ten 1
minutes 1
was 1
rejoiced 1
to 1
find 1
my 1
friend 1
s 1
arm 1
in 1
mine 1
and 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
uproar 1
He 1
walked 1
swiftly 1
and 1
in 1
silence 1
for 1
some 1
few 1
minutes 1
until 1
we 1
had 1
turned 1
down 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
quiet 1
streets 1
which 1
lead 1
towards 1
the 1
Edgeware 1
Road 1
You 1
did 1
it 1
very 1
nicely 1
Doctor 1
he 1
remarked 1
Nothing 1
could 1
have 1
been 1
better 1
It 1
is 1
all 1
right 1
You 1
have 1
the 1
photograph 1
I 1
know 1
where 1
it 1
is 1
And 1
how 1
did 1
you 1
find 1
out 1
She 1
showed 1
me 1
as 1
I 1
told 1
you 1
she 1
would 1
I 1
am 1
still 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
mystery 1
said 1
he 1
laughing 1
The 1
matter 1
was 1
perfectly 1
simple 1
You 1
of 1
course 1
saw 1
that 1
everyone 1
in 1
the 1
street 1
was 1
an 1
accomplice 1
They 1
were 1
all 1
engaged 1
for 1
the 1
evening 1
I 1
guessed 1
as 1
much 1
Then 1
when 1
the 1
row 1
broke 1
out 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
little 1
moist 1
red 1
paint 1
in 1
the 1
palm 1
of 1
my 1
hand 1
I 1
rushed 1
forward 1
fell 1
down 1
clapped 1
my 1
hand 1
to 1
my 1
face 1
and 1
became 1
a 1
piteous 1
spectacle 1
It 1
is 1
an 1
old 1
trick 1
That 1
also 1
I 1
could 1
fathom 1
Then 1
they 1
carried 1
me 1
in 1
She 1
was 1
bound 1
to 1
have 1
me 1
in 1
What 1
else 1
could 1
she 1
do 1
And 1
into 1
her 1
sitting 1
room 1
which 1
was 1
the 1
very 1
room 1
which 1
I 1
suspected 1
It 1
lay 1
between 1
that 1
and 1
her 1
bedroom 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
determined 1
to 1
see 1
which 1
They 1
laid 1
me 1
on 1
a 1
couch 1
I 1
motioned 1
for 1
air 1
they 1
were 1
compelled 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
you 1
had 1
your 1
chance 1
How 1
did 1
that 1
help 1
you 1
It 1
was 1
all 1
important 1
When 1
a 1
woman 1
thinks 1
that 1
her 1
house 1
is 1
on 1
fire 1
her 1
instinct 1
is 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
rush 1
to 1
the 1
thing 1
which 1
she 1
values 1
most 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
perfectly 1
overpowering 1
impulse 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
taken 1
advantage 1
of 1
it 1
In 1
the 1
case 1
of 1
the 1
Darlington 1
substitution 1
scandal 1
it 1
was 1
of 1
use 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
also 1
in 1
the 1
Arnsworth 1
Castle 1
business 1
A 1
married 1
woman 1
grabs 1
at 1
her 1
baby 1
an 1
unmarried 1
one 1
reaches 1
for 1
her 1
jewel 1
box 1
Now 1
it 1
was 1
clear 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
our 1
lady 1
of 1
to 1
day 1
had 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
more 1
precious 1
to 1
her 1
than 1
what 1
we 1
are 1
in 1
quest 1
of 1
She 1
would 1
rush 1
to 1
secure 1
it 1
The 1
alarm 1
of 1
fire 1
was 1
admirably 1
done 1
The 1
smoke 1
and 1
shouting 1
were 1
enough 1
to 1
shake 1
nerves 1
of 1
steel 1
She 1
responded 1
beautifully 1
The 1
photograph 1
is 1
in 1
a 1
recess 1
behind 1
a 1
sliding 1
panel 1
just 1
above 1
the 1
right 1
bell 1
pull 1
She 1
was 1
there 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
and 1
I 1
caught 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
it 1
as 1
she 1
half 1
drew 1
it 1
out 1
When 1
I 1
cried 1
out 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
false 1
alarm 1
she 1
replaced 1
it 1
glanced 1
at 1
the 1
rocket 1
rushed 1
from 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
seen 1
her 1
since 1
I 1
rose 1
and 1
making 1
my 1
excuses 1
escaped 1
from 1
the 1
house 1
I 1
hesitated 1
whether 1
to 1
attempt 1
to 1
secure 1
the 1
photograph 1
at 1
once 1
but 1
the 1
coachman 1
had 1
come 1
in 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
watching 1
me 1
narrowly 1
it 1
seemed 1
safer 1
to 1
wait 1
A 1
little 1
over 1
precipitance 1
may 1
ruin 1
all 1
And 1
now 1
I 1
asked 1
Our 1
quest 1
is 1
practically 1
finished 1
I 1
shall 1
call 1
with 1
the 1
King 1
to 1
morrow 1
and 1
with 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
care 1
to 1
come 1
with 1
us 1
We 1
will 1
be 1
shown 1
into 1
the 1
sitting 1
room 1
to 1
wait 1
for 1
the 1
lady 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
probable 1
that 1
when 1
she 1
comes 1
she 1
may 1
find 1
neither 1
us 1
nor 1
the 1
photograph 1
It 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
satisfaction 1
to 1
his 1
Majesty 1
to 1
regain 1
it 1
with 1
his 1
own 1
hands 1
And 1
when 1
will 1
you 1
call 1
At 1
eight 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
She 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
up 1
so 1
that 1
we 1
shall 1
have 1
a 1
clear 1
field 1
Besides 1
we 1
must 1
be 1
prompt 1
for 1
this 1
marriage 1
may 1
mean 1
a 1
complete 1
change 1
in 1
her 1
life 1
and 1
habits 1
I 1
must 1
wire 1
to 1
the 1
King 1
without 1
delay 1
We 1
had 1
reached 1
Baker 1
Street 1
and 1
had 1
stopped 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
He 1
was 1
searching 1
his 1
pockets 1
for 1
the 1
key 1
when 1
someone 1
passing 1
said 1
Good 1
night 1
Mister 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
There 1
were 1
several 1
people 1
on 1
the 1
pavement 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
but 1
the 1
greeting 1
appeared 1
to 1
come 1
from 1
a 1
slim 1
youth 1
in 1
an 1
ulster 1
who 1
had 1
hurried 1
by 1
I 1
ve 1
heard 1
that 1
voice 1
before 1
said 1
Holmes 1
staring 1
down 1
the 1
dimly 1
lit 1
street 1
Now 1
I 1
wonder 1
who 1
the 1
deuce 1
that 1
could 1
have 1
been 1
III 1
I 1
slept 1
at 1
Baker 1
Street 1
that 1
night 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
engaged 1
upon 1
our 1
toast 1
and 1
coffee 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
when 1
the 1
King 1
of 1
Bohemia 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
You 1
have 1
really 1
got 1
it 1
he 1
cried 1
grasping 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
by 1
either 1
shoulder 1
and 1
looking 1
eagerly 1
into 1
his 1
face 1
Not 1
yet 1
But 1
you 1
have 1
hopes 1
I 1
have 1
hopes 1
Then 1
come 1
I 1
am 1
all 1
impatience 1
to 1
be 1
gone 1
We 1
must 1
have 1
a 1
cab 1
No 1
my 1
brougham 1
is 1
waiting 1
Then 1
that 1
will 1
simplify 1
matters 1
We 1
descended 1
and 1
started 1
off 1
once 1
more 1
for 1
Briony 1
Lodge 1
Irene 1
Adler 1
is 1
married 1
remarked 1
Holmes 1
Married 1
When 1
Yesterday 1
But 1
to 1
whom 1
To 1
an 1
English 1
lawyer 1
named 1
Norton 1
But 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
love 1
him 1
I 1
am 1
in 1
hopes 1
that 1
she 1
does 1
And 1
why 1
in 1
hopes 1
Because 1
it 1
would 1
spare 1
your 1
Majesty 1
all 1
fear 1
of 1
future 1
annoyance 1
If 1
the 1
lady 1
loves 1
her 1
husband 1
she 1
does 1
not 1
love 1
your 1
Majesty 1
If 1
she 1
does 1
not 1
love 1
your 1
Majesty 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
reason 1
why 1
she 1
should 1
interfere 1
with 1
your 1
Majesty 1
s 1
plan 1
It 1
is 1
true 1
And 1
yet 1
Well 1
I 1
wish 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
station 1
What 1
a 1
queen 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
made 1
He 1
relapsed 1
into 1
a 1
moody 1
silence 1
which 1
was 1
not 1
broken 1
until 1
we 1
drew 1
up 1
in 1
Serpentine 1
Avenue 1
The 1
door 1
of 1
Briony 1
Lodge 1
was 1
open 1
and 1
an 1
elderly 1
woman 1
stood 1
upon 1
the 1
steps 1
She 1
watched 1
us 1
with 1
a 1
sardonic 1
eye 1
as 1
we 1
stepped 1
from 1
the 1
brougham 1
Mr 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
I 1
believe 1
said 1
she 1
I 1
am 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
answered 1
my 1
companion 1
looking 1
at 1
her 1
with 1
a 1
questioning 1
and 1
rather 1
startled 1
gaze 1
Indeed 1
My 1
mistress 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
likely 1
to 1
call 1
She 1
left 1
this 1
morning 1
with 1
her 1
husband 1
by 1
the 1
train 1
from 1
Charing 1
Cross 1
for 1
the 1
Continent 1
What 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
staggered 1
back 1
white 1
with 1
chagrin 1
and 1
surprise 1
Do 1
you 1
mean 1
that 1
she 1
has 1
left 1
England 1
Never 1
to 1
return 1
And 1
the 1
papers 1
asked 1
the 1
King 1
hoarsely 1
All 1
is 1
lost 1
We 1
shall 1
see 1
He 1
pushed 1
past 1
the 1
servant 1
and 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
drawing 1
room 1
followed 1
by 1
the 1
King 1
and 1
myself 1
The 1
furniture 1
was 1
scattered 1
about 1
in 1
every 1
direction 1
with 1
dismantled 1
shelves 1
and 1
open 1
drawers 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
lady 1
had 1
hurriedly 1
ransacked 1
them 1
before 1
her 1
flight 1
Holmes 1
rushed 1
at 1
the 1
bell 1
pull 1
tore 1
back 1
a 1
small 1
sliding 1
shutter 1
and 1
plunging 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
pulled 1
out 1
a 1
photograph 1
and 1
a 1
letter 1
The 1
photograph 1
was 1
of 1

herself 1
in 1
evening 1
dress 1
the 1
letter 1
was 1
superscribed 1
to 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
Esq 1
To 1
be 1
left 1
till 1
called 1
for 1
My 1
friend 1
tore 1
it 1
open 1
and 1
we 1
all 1
three 1
read 1
it 1
together 1
It 1
was 1
dated 1
at 1
midnight 1
of 1
the 1
preceding 1
night 1
and 1
ran 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
MY 1
DEAR 1
MR 1
SHERLOCK 1
HOLMES 1
You 1
really 1
did 1
it 1
very 1
well 1
You 1
took 1
me 1
in 1
completely 1
Until 1
after 1
the 1
alarm 1
of 1
fire 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
a 1
suspicion 1
But 1
then 1
when 1
I 1
found 1
how 1
I 1
had 1
betrayed 1
myself 1
I 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
warned 1
against 1
you 1
months 1
ago 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
told 1
that 1
if 1
the 1
King 1
employed 1
an 1
agent 1
it 1
would 1
certainly 1
be 1
you 1
And 1
your 1
address 1
had 1
been 1
given 1
me 1
Yet 1
with 1
all 1
this 1
you 1
made 1
me 1
reveal 1
what 1
you 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
Even 1
after 1
I 1
became 1
suspicious 1
I 1
found 1
it 1
hard 1
to 1
think 1
evil 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
dear 1
kind 1
old 1
clergyman 1
But 1
you 1
know 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
trained 1
as 1
an 1
actress 1
myself 1
Male 1
costume 1
is 1
nothing 1
new 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
often 1
take 1
advantage 1
of 1
the 1
freedom 1
which 1
it 1
gives 1
I 1
sent 1
John 1
the 1
coachman 1
to 1
watch 1
you 1
ran 1
up 1
stairs 1
got 1
into 1
my 1
walking 1
clothes 1
as 1
I 1
call 1
them 1
and 1
came 1
down 1
just 1
as 1
you 1
departed 1
Well 1
I 1
followed 1
you 1
to 1
your 1
door 1
and 1
so 1
made 1
sure 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
really 1
an 1
object 1
of 1
interest 1
to 1
the 1
celebrated 1
Mr 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
Then 1
I 1
rather 1
imprudently 1
wished 1
you 1
good 1
night 1
and 1
started 1
for 1
the 1
Temple 1
to 1
see 1
my 1
husband 1
We 1
both 1
thought 1
the 1
best 1
resource 1
was 1
flight 1
when 1
pursued 1
by 1
so 1
formidable 1
an 1
antagonist 1
so 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
the 1
nest 1
empty 1
when 1
you 1
call 1
to 1
morrow 1
As 1
to 1
the 1
photograph 1
your 1
client 1
may 1
rest 1
in 1
peace 1
I 1
love 1
and 1
am 1
loved 1
by 1
a 1
better 1
man 1
than 1
he 1
The 1
King 1
may 1
do 1
what 1
he 1
will 1
without 1
hindrance 1
from 1
one 1
whom 1
he 1
has 1
cruelly 1
wronged 1
I 1
keep 1
it 1
only 1
to 1
safeguard 1
myself 1
and 1
to 1
preserve 1
a 1
weapon 1
which 1
will 1
always 1
secure 1
me 1
from 1
any 1
steps 1
which 1
he 1
might 1
take 1
in 1
the 1
future 1
I 1
leave 1
a 1
photograph 1
which 1
he 1
might 1
care 1
to 1
possess 1
and 1
I 1
remain 1
dear 1
Mr 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
Very 1
truly 1
yours 1
IRENE 1
NORTON 1

ADLER 1
What 1
a 1
woman 1
oh 1
what 1
a 1
woman 1
cried 1
the 1
King 1
of 1
Bohemia 1
when 1
we 1
had 1
all 1
three 1
read 1
this 1
epistle 1
Did 1
I 1
not 1
tell 1
you 1
how 1
quick 1
and 1
resolute 1
she 1
was 1
Would 1
she 1
not 1
have 1
made 1
an 1
admirable 1
queen 1
Is 1
it 1
not 1
a 1
pity 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
on 1
my 1
level 1
From 1
what 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
of 1
the 1
lady 1
she 1
seems 1
indeed 1
to 1
be 1
on 1
a 1
very 1
different 1
level 1
to 1
your 1
Majesty 1
said 1
Holmes 1
coldly 1
I 1
am 1
sorry 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
bring 1
your 1
Majesty 1
s 1
business 1
to 1
a 1
more 1
successful 1
conclusion 1
On 1
the 1
contrary 1
my 1
dear 1
sir 1
cried 1
the 1
King 1
nothing 1
could 1
be 1
more 1
successful 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
her 1
word 1
is 1
inviolate 1
The 1
photograph 1
is 1
now 1
as 1
safe 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
fire 1
I 1
am 1
glad 1
to 1
hear 1
your 1
Majesty 1
say 1
so 1
I 1
am 1
immensely 1
indebted 1
to 1
you 1
Pray 1
tell 1
me 1
in 1
what 1
way 1
I 1
can 1
reward 1
you 1
This 1
ring 1
He 1
slipped 1
an 1
emerald 1
snake 1
ring 1
from 1
his 1
finger 1
and 1
held 1
it 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
palm 1
of 1
his 1
hand 1
Your 1
Majesty 1
has 1
something 1
which 1
I 1
should 1
value 1
even 1
more 1
highly 1
said 1
Holmes 1
You 1
have 1
but 1
to 1
name 1
it 1
This 1
photograph 1
The 1
King 1
stared 1
at 1
him 1
in 1
amazement 1
Irene 1
s 1
photograph 1
he 1
cried 1
Certainly 1
if 1
you 1
wish 1
it 1
I 1
thank 1
your 1
Majesty 1
Then 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
more 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
I 1
have 1
the 1
honour 1
to 1
wish 1
you 1
a 1
very 1
good 1
morning 1
He 1
bowed 1
and 1
turning 1
away 1
without 1
observing 1
the 1
hand 1
which 1
the 1
King 1
had 1
stretched 1
out 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
set 1
off 1
in 1
my 1
company 1
for 1
his 1
chambers 1
And 1
that 1
was 1
how 1
a 1
great 1
scandal 1
threatened 1
to 1
affect 1
the 1
kingdom 1
of 1
Bohemia 1
and 1
how 1
the 1
best 1
plans 1
of 1
Mr 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
were 1
beaten 1
by 1
a 1
woman 1
s 1
wit 1
He 1
used 1
to 1
make 1
merry 1
over 1
the 1
cleverness 1
of 1
women 1
but 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
heard 1
him 1
do 1
it 1
of 1
late 1
And 1
when 1
he 1
speaks 1
of 1
Irene 1
Adler 1
or 1
when 1
he 1
refers 1
to 1
her 1
photograph 1
it 1
is 1
always 1
under 1
the 1
honourable 1
title 1
of 1
the 1
woman 1
ADVENTURE 1
II 1
THE 1
RED 1
HEADED 1
LEAGUE 1
I 1
had 1
called 1
upon 1
my 1
friend 1
Mr 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
one 1
day 1
in 1
the 1
autumn 1
of 1
last 1
year 1
and 1
found 1
him 1
in 1
deep 1
conversation 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
stout 1
florid 1
faced 1
elderly 1
gentleman 1
with 1
fiery 1
red 1
hair 1
With 1
an 1
apology 1
for 1
my 1
intrusion 1
I 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
withdraw 1
when 1
Holmes 1
pulled 1
me 1
abruptly 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
closed 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
me 1
You 1
could 1
not 1
possibly 1
have 1
come 1
at 1
a 1
better 1
time 1
my 1
dear 1
Watson 1
he 1
said 1
cordially 1
I 1
was 1
afraid 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
engaged 1
So 1
I 1
am 1
Very 1
much 1
so 1
Then 1
I 1
can 1
wait 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
Not 1
at 1
all 1
This 1
gentleman 1
Mr 1
Wilson 1
has 1
been 1
my 1
partner 1
and 1
helper 1
in 1
many 1
of 1
my 1
most 1
successful 1
cases 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
of 1
the 1
utmost 1
use 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
yours 1
also 1
The 1
stout 1
gentleman 1
half 1
rose 1
from 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
gave 1
a 1
bob 1
of 1
greeting 1
with 1
a 1
quick 1
little 1
questioning 1
glance 1
from 1
his 1
small 1
fat 1
encircled 1
eyes 1
Try 1
the 1
settee 1
said 1
Holmes 1
relapsing 1
into 1
his 1
armchair 1
and 1
putting 1
his 1
fingertips 1
together 1
as 1
was 1
his 1
custom 1
when 1
in 1
judicial 1
moods 1
I 1
know 1
my 1
dear 1
Watson 1
that 1
you 1
share 1
my 1
love 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
bizarre 1
and 1
outside 1
the 1
conventions 1
and 1
humdrum 1
routine 1
of 1
everyday 1
life 1
You 1
have 1
shown 1
your 1
relish 1
for 1
it 1
by 1
the 1
enthusiasm 1
which 1
has 1
prompted 1
you 1
to 1
chronicle 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
excuse 1
my 1
saying 1
so 1
somewhat 1
to 1
embellish 1
so 1
many 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
little 1
adventures 1
Your 1
cases 1
have 1
indeed 1
been 1
of 1
the 1
greatest 1
interest 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
observed 1
You 1
will 1
remember 1
that 1
I 1
remarked 1
the 1
other 1
day 1
just 1
before 1
we 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
very 1
simple 1
problem 1
presented 1
by 1
Miss 1
Mary 1
Sutherland 1
that 1
for 1
strange 1
effects 1
and 1
extraordinary 1
combinations 1
we 1
must 1
go 1
to 1
life 1
itself 1
which 1
is 1
always 1
far 1
more 1
daring 1
than 1
any 1
effort 1
of 1
the 1
imagination 1
A 1
proposition 1
which 1
I 1
took 1
the 1
liberty 1
of 1
doubting 1
You 1
did 1
Doctor 1
but 1
none 1
the 1
less 1
you 1
must 1
come 1
round 1
to 1
my 1
view 1
for 1
otherwise 1
I 1
shall 1
keep 1
on 1
piling 1
fact 1
upon 1
fact 1
on 1
you 1
until 1
your 1
reason 1
breaks 1
down 1
under 1
them 1
and 1
acknowledges 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
right 1
Now 1
Mr 1
Jabez 1
Wilson 1
here 1
has 1
been 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
call 1
upon 1
me 1
this 1
morning 1
and 1
to 1
begin 1
a 1
narrative 1
which 1
promises 1
to 1
be 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
singular 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
listened 1
to 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
You 1
have 1
heard 1
me 1
remark 1
that 1
the 1
strangest 1
and 1
most 1
unique 1
things 1
are 1
very 1
often 1
connected 1
not 1
with 1
the 1
larger 1
but 1
with 1
the 1
smaller 1
crimes 1
and 1
occasionally 1
indeed 1
where 1
there 1
is 1
room 1
for 1
doubt 1
whether 1
any 1
positive 1
crime 1
has 1
been 1
committed 1
As 1
far 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
heard 1
it 1
is 1
impossible 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
say 1
whether 1
the 1
present 1
case 1
is 1
an 1
instance 1
of 1
crime 1
or 1
not 1
but 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
events 1
is 1
certainly 1
among 1
the 1
most 1
singular 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
listened 1
to 1
Perhaps 1
Mr 1
Wilson 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
the 1
great 1
kindness 1
to 1
recommence 1
your 1
narrative 1
I 1
ask 1
you 1
not 1
merely 1
because 1
my 1
friend 1
Dr 1
Watson 1
has 1
not 1
heard 1
the 1
opening 1
part 1
but 1
also 1
because 1
the 1
peculiar 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
story 1
makes 1
me 1
anxious 1
to 1
have 1
every 1
possible 1
detail 1
from 1
your 1
lips 1
As 1
a 1
rule 1
when 1
I 1
have 1
heard 1
some 1
slight 1
indication 1
of 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
events 1
I 1
am 1
able 1
to 1
guide 1
myself 1
by 1
the 1
thousands 1
of 1
other 1
similar 1
cases 1
which 1
occur 1
to 1
my 1
memory 1
In 1
the 1
present 1
instance 1
I 1
am 1
forced 1
to 1
admit 1
that 1
the 1
facts 1
are 1
to 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
my 1
belief 1
unique 1
The 1
portly 1
client 1
puffed 1
out 1
his 1
chest 1
with 1
an 1
appearance 1
of 1
some 1
little 1
pride 1
and 1
pulled 1
a 1
dirty 1
and 1
wrinkled 1
newspaper 1
from 1
the 1
inside 1
pocket 1
of 1
his 1
greatcoat 1
As 1
he 1
glanced 1
down 1
the 1
advertisement 1
column 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
thrust 1
forward 1
and 1
the 1
paper 1
flattened 1
out 1
upon 1
his 1
knee 1
I 1
took 1
a 1
good 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
after 1
the 1
fashion 1
of 1
my 1
companion 1
to 1
read 1
the 1
indications 1
which 1
might 1
be 1
presented 1
by 1
his 1
dress 1
or 1
appearance 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
gain 1
very 1
much 1
however 1
by 1
my 1
inspection 1
Our 1
visitor 1
bore 1
every 1
mark 1
of 1
being 1
an 1
average 1
commonplace 1
British 1
tradesman 1
obese 1
pompous 1
and 1
slow 1
He 1
wore 1
rather 1
baggy 1
grey 1
shepherd 1
s 1
check 1
trousers 1
a 1
not 1
over 1
clean 1
black 1
frock 1
coat 1
unbuttoned 1
in 1
the 1
front 1
and 1
a 1
drab 1
waistcoat 1
with 1
a 1
heavy 1
brassy 1
Albert 1
chain 1
and 1
a 1
square 1
pierced 1
bit 1
of 1
metal 1
dangling 1
down 1
as 1
an 1
ornament 1
A 1
frayed 1
top 1
hat 1
and 1
a 1
faded 1
brown 1
overcoat 1
with 1
a 1
wrinkled 1
velvet 1
collar 1
lay 1
upon 1
a 1
chair 1
beside 1
him 1
Altogether 1
look 1
as 1
I 1
would 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
remarkable 1
about 1
the 1
man 1
save 1
his 1
blazing 1
red 1
head 1
and 1
the 1
expression 1
of 1
extreme 1
chagrin 1
and 1
discontent 1
upon 1
his 1
features 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
quick 1
eye 1
took 1
in 1
my 1
occupation 1
and 1
he 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
with 1
a 1
smile 1
as 1
he 1
noticed 1
my 1
questioning 1
glances 1
Beyond 1
the 1
obvious 1
facts 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
at 1
some 1
time 1
done 1
manual 1
labour 1
that 1
he 1
takes 1
snuff 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
Freemason 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
in 1
China 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
done 1
a 1
considerable 1
amount 1
of 1
writing 1
lately 1
I 1
can 1
deduce 1
nothing 1
else 1
Mr 1
Jabez 1
Wilson 1
started 1
up 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
with 1
his 1
forefinger 1
upon 1
the 1
paper 1
but 1
his 1
eyes 1
upon 1
my 1
companion 1
How 1
in 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
good 1
fortune 1
did 1
you 1
know 1
all 1
that 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
he 1
asked 1
How 1
did 1
you 1
know 1
for 1
example 1
that 1
I 1
did 1
manual 1
labour 1
It 1
s 1
as 1
true 1
as 1
gospel 1
for 1
I 1
began 1
as 1
a 1
ship 1
s 1
carpenter 1
Your 1
hands 1
my 1
dear 1
sir 1
Your 1
right 1
hand 1
is 1
quite 1
a 1
size 1
larger 1
than 1
your 1
left 1
You 1
have 1
worked 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
muscles 1
are 1
more 1
developed 1
Well 1
the 1
snuff 1
then 1
and 1
the 1
Freemasonry 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
insult 1
your 1
intelligence 1
by 1
telling 1
you 1
how 1
I 1
read 1
that 1
especially 1
as 1
rather 1
against 1
the 1
strict 1
rules 1
of 1
your 1
order 1
you 1
use 1
an 1
arc 1
and 1
compass 1
breastpin 1
Ah 1
of 1
course 1
I 1
forgot 1
that 1
But 1
the 1
writing 1
What 1
else 1
can 1
be 1
indicated 1
by 1
that 1
right 1
cuff 1
so 1
very 1
shiny 1
for 1
five 1
inches 1
and 1
the 1
left 1
one 1
with 1
the 1
smooth 1
patch 1
near 1
the 1
elbow 1
where 1
you 1
rest 1
it 1
upon 1
the 1
desk 1
Well 1
but 1
China 1
The 1
fish 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
tattooed 1
immediately 1
above 1
your 1
right 1
wrist 1
could 1
only 1
have 1
been 1
done 1
in 1
China 1
I 1
have 1
made 1
a 1
small 1
study 1
of 1
tattoo 1
marks 1
and 1
have 1
even 1
contributed 1
to 1
the 1
literature 1
of 1
the 1
subject 1
That 1
trick 1
of 1
staining 1
the 1
fishes 1
scales 1
of 1
a 1
delicate 1
pink 1
is 1
quite 1
peculiar 1
to 1
China 1
When 1
in 1
addition 1
I 1
see 1
a 1
Chinese 1
coin 1
hanging 1
from 1
your 1
watch 1
chain 1
the 1
matter 1
becomes 1
even 1
more 1
simple 1
Mr 1
Jabez 1
Wilson 1
laughed 1
heavily 1
Well 1
I 1
never 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
thought 1
at 1
first 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
done 1
something 1
clever 1
but 1
I 1
see 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
in 1
it 1
after 1
all 1
I 1
begin 1
to 1
think 1
Watson 1
said 1
Holmes 1
that 1
I 1
make 1
a 1
mistake 1
in 1
explaining 1
Omne 1
ignotum 1
pro 1
magnifico 1
you 1
know 1
and 1
my 1
poor 1
little 1
reputation 1
such 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
will 1
suffer 1
shipwreck 1
if 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
candid 1
Can 1
you 1
not 1
find 1
the 1
advertisement 1
Mr 1
Wilson 1
Yes 1
I 1
have 1
got 1
it 1
now 1
he 1
answered 1
with 1
his 1
thick 1
red 1
finger 1
planted 1
halfway 1
down 1
the 1
column 1
Here 1
it 1
is 1
This 1
is 1
what 1
began 1
it 1
all 1
You 1
just 1
read 1

What 1
on 1
earth 1
does 1
this 1
mean 1
I 1
ejaculated 1
after 1
I 1
had 1
twice 1
read 1
over 1
the 1
extraordinary 1
announcement 1
Holmes 1
chuckled 1
and 1
wriggled 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
as 1
was 1
his 1
habit 1
when 1
in 1
high 1
spirits 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
off 1
the 1
beaten 1
track 1

and 1
the 1
effect 1

advertisement 1
had 1
upon 1

You 1
will 1
first 1
make 1
a 1
note 1
Doctor 1
of 1
the 1
paper 1
and 1
the 1
date 1
It 1
is 1
The 1
Morning 1
Chronicle 1
of 1
April 1
Just 1
two 1
months 1
ago 1
Very 1
good 1
Now 1
Mr 1
Wilson 1
Well 1
it 1
is 1
just 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
telling 1
you 1
Mr 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
said 1
Jabez 1
Wilson 1
mopping 1
his 1
forehead 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
small 1
pawnbroker 1
s 1
business 1
at 1
Coburg 1
Square 1
near 1
the 1
City 1
It 1
s 1
not 1
a 1
very 1
large 1
affair 1
and 1
of 1
late 1
years 1
it 1
has 1
not 1
done 1
more 1
than 1
just 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
living 1
I 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
keep 1
two 1
assistants 1
but 1
now 1
I 1
only 1
keep 1
one 1
and 1
I 1
would 1
have 1
a 1
job 1
to 1
pay 1
him 1
but 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
willing 1
to 1
come 1
for 1
half 1
wages 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
learn 1
the 1
business 1
What 1
is 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
this 1
obliging 1
youth 1
asked 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
His 1
name 1
is 1
Vincent 1
Spaulding 1
and 1
he 1
s 1
not 1
such 1
a 1
youth 1
either 1
It 1
s 1
hard 1
to 1
say 1
his 1
age 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
wish 1
a 1
smarter 1
assistant 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
and 1
I 1
know 1
very 1
well 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
better 1
himself 1
and 1
earn 1
twice 1
what 1
I 1
am 1
able 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
But 1
after 1
all 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
satisfied 1
why 1
should 1
I 1
put 1
ideas 1
in 1
his 1
head 1
Why 1
indeed 1
You 1
seem 1
most 1
fortunate 1
in 1
having 1
an 1
employe 1
who 1
comes 1
under 1
the 1
full 1
market 1
price 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
common 1
experience 1
among 1
employers 1
in 1
this 1
age 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
that 1
your 1
assistant 1
is 1
not 1
as 1
remarkable 1
as 1
your 1
advertisement 1
Oh 1
he 1
has 1
his 1
faults 1
too 1
said 1
Mr 1
Wilson 1
Never 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
fellow 1
for 1
photography 1
Snapping 1
away 1
with 1
a 1
camera 1
when 1
he 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
improving 1
his 1
mind 1
and 1
then 1
diving 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
like 1
a 1
rabbit 1
into 1
its 1
hole 1
to 1
develop 1
his 1
pictures 1
That 1
is 1
his 1
main 1
fault 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
he 1
s 1
a 1
good 1
worker 1
There 1
s 1
no 1
vice 1
in 1
him 1
He 1
is 1
still 1
with 1
you 1
I 1
presume 1
Yes 1
sir 1
He 1
and 1
a 1
girl 1
of 1
fourteen 1
who 1
does 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
simple 1
cooking 1
and 1
keeps 1
the 1
place 1
clean 1
that 1
s 1
all 1
I 1
have 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
for 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
widower 1
and 1
never 1
had 1
any 1
family 1
We 1
live 1
very 1
quietly 1
sir 1
the 1
three 1
of 1
us 1
and 1
we 1
keep 1
a 1
roof 1
over 1
our 1
heads 1
and 1
pay 1
our 1
debts 1
if 1
we 1
do 1
nothing 1
more 1
The 1
first 1
thing 1
that 1
put 1
us 1
out 1
was 1
that 1
advertisement 1
Spaulding 1
he 1
came 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
office 1
just 1
this 1
day 1
eight 1
weeks 1
with 1
this 1
very 1
paper 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
he 1
says 1
I 1
wish 1
to 1
the 1
Lord 1
Mr 1
Wilson 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
red 1
headed 1
man 1
Why 1
that 1
I 1
asks 1
Why 1
says 1
he 1
here 1
s 1
another 1
vacancy 1
on 1
the 1
League 1
of 1
the 1
Red 1
headed 1
Men 1
It 1
s 1
worth 1
quite 1
a 1
little 1
fortune 1
to 1
any 1
man 1
who 1
gets 1
it 1
and 1
I 1
understand 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
more 1
vacancies 1
than 1
there 1
are 1
men 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
trustees 1
are 1
at 1
their 1
wits 1
end 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
the 1
money 1
If 1
my 1
hair 1
would 1
only 1
change 1
colour 1
here 1
s 1
a 1
nice 1
little 1
crib 1
all 1
ready 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
step 1
into 1
Why 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
then 1
I 1
asked 1
You 1
see 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
very 1
stay 1
at 1
home 1
man 1
and 1
as 1
my 1
business 1
came 1
to 1
me 1
instead 1
of 1
my 1
having 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
it 1
I 1
was 1
often 1
weeks 1
on 1
end 1
without 1
putting 1
my 1
foot 1
over 1
the 1
door 1
mat 1
In 1
that 1
way 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
much 1
of 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
outside 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
always 1
glad 1
of 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
news 1
Have 1
you 1
never 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
League 1
of 1
the 1
Red 1
headed 1
Men 1
he 1
asked 1
with 1
his 1
eyes 1
open 1
Never 1
Why 1
I 1
wonder 1
at 1
that 1
for 1
you 1
are 1
eligible 1
yourself 1
for 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
vacancies 1
And 1
what 1
are 1
they 1
worth 1
I 1
asked 1
Oh 1
merely 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
hundred 1
a 1
year 1
but 1
the 1
work 1
is 1
slight 1
and 1
it 1
need 1
not 1
interfere 1
very 1
much 1
with 1
one 1
s 1
other 1
occupations 1
Well 1
you 1
can 1
easily 1
think 1
that 2
made 1
me 1
prick 1
up 1
my 1
ears 1
for 1
the 1
business 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
over 1
good 1
for 1
some 1
years 1
and 1
an 1
extra 1
couple 1
of 1
hundred 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
very 1
handy 1
Tell 1
me 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
said 1
I 1
Well 1
said 1
he 1
showing 1
me 1
the 1
advertisement 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
for 1
yourself 1
that 1
the 1
League 1
has 1
a 1
vacancy 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
the 1
address 1
where 1
you 1
should 1
apply 1
for 1
particulars 1
As 1
far 1
as 1
I 1
can 1
make 1
out 1
the 1
League 1
was 1
founded 1
by 1
an 1
American 1
millionaire 1
Ezekiah 1
Hopkins 1
who 1
was 1
very 1
peculiar 1
in 1
his 1
ways 1
He 1
was 1
himself 1
red 1
headed 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
great 1
sympathy 1
for 1
all 1
red 1
headed 1
men 1
so 1
when 1
he 1
died 1
it 1
was 1
found 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
his 1
enormous 1
fortune 1
in 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
trustees 1
with 1
instructions 1
to 1
apply 1
the 1
interest 1
to 1
the 1
providing 1
of 1
easy 1
berths 1
to 1
men 1
whose 1
hair 1
is 1
of 1
that 1
colour 1
From 1
all 1
I 1
hear 1
it 1
is 1
splendid 1
pay 1
and 1
very 1
little 1
to 1
do 1
But 1
said 1
I 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
millions 1
of 1
red 1
headed 1
men 1
who 1
would 1
apply 1
Not 1
so 1
many 1
as 1
you 1
might 1
think 1
he 1
answered 1
You 1
see 1
it 1
is 1
really 1
confined 1
to 1
Londoners 1
and 1
to 1
grown 1
men 1
This 1
American 1
had 1
started 1
from 1
London 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
young 1
and 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
old 1
town 1
a 1
good 1
turn 1
Then 1
again 1
I 1
have 1
heard 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
use 1
your 1
applying 1
if 1
your 1
hair 1
is 1
light 1
red 1
or 1
dark 1
red 1
or 1
anything 1
but 1
real 1
bright 1
blazing 1
fiery 1
red 1
Now 1
if 1
you 1
cared 1
to 1
apply 1
Mr 1
Wilson 1
you 1
would 1
just 1
walk 1
in 1
but 1
perhaps 1
it 1
would 1
hardly 1
be 1
worth 1
your 1
while 1
to 1
put 1
yourself 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
for 1
the 1
sake 1
of 1
a 1
few 1
hundred 1
pounds 1
Now 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
fact 1
gentlemen 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
see 1
for 1
yourselves 1
that 1
my 1
hair 1
is 1
of 1
a 1
very 1
full 1
and 1
rich 1
tint 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
any 1
competition 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
I 1
stood 1
as 1
good 1
a 1
chance 1
as 1
any 1
man 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
ever 1
met 1
Vincent 1
Spaulding 1
seemed 1
to 1
know 1
so 1
much 1
about 1
it 1
that 1
I 1
thought 1
he 1
might 1
prove 1
useful 1
so 1
I 1
just 1
ordered 1
him 1
to 1
put 1
up 1
the 1
shutters 1
for 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
to 1
come 1
right 1
away 1
with 1
me 1
He 1
was 1
very 1
willing 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
holiday 1
so 1
we 1
shut 1
the 1
business 1
up 1
and 1
started 1
off 1
for 1
the 1
address 1
that 1
was 1
given 1
us 1
in 1
the 1
advertisement 1
I 1
never 1
hope 1
to 1
see 1
such 1
a 1
sight 1
as 1
that 1
again 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
From 1
north 1
south 1
east 1
and 1
west 1
every 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
a 1
shade 1
of 1
red 1
in 1
his 1
hair 1
had 1
tramped 1
into 1
the 1
city 1
to 1
answer 1
the 1
advertisement 1
Fleet 1
Street 1
was 1
choked 1
with 1
red 1
headed 1
folk 1
and 1
Pope 1
s 1
Court 1
looked 1
like 1
a 1
coster 1
s 1
orange 1
barrow 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
have 1
thought 1
there 1
were 1
so 1
many 1
in 1
the 1
whole 1
country 1
as 1
were 1
brought 1
together 1
by 1
that 1
single 1
advertisement 1
Every 1
shade 1
of 1
colour 1
they 1
were 1
straw 1
lemon 1
orange 1
brick 1
Irish 1
setter 1
liver 1
clay 1
but 1
as 1
Spaulding 1
said 1
there 1
were 1
not 1
many 1
who 1
had 1
the 1
real 1
vivid 1
flame 1
coloured 1
tint 1
When 1
I 1
saw 1
how 1
many 1
were 1
waiting 1
I 1
would 1
have 1
given 1
it 1
up 1
in 1
despair 1
but 1
Spaulding 1
would 1
not 1
hear 1
of 1
it 1
How 1
he 1
did 1
it 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
imagine 1
but 1
he 1
pushed 1
and 1
pulled 1
and 1
butted 1
until 1
he 1
got 1
me 1
through 1
the 1
crowd 1
and 1
right 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
steps 1
which 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
office 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
double 1
stream 1
upon 1
the 1
stair 1
some 1
going 1
up 1
in 1
hope 1
and 1
some 1
coming 1
back 1
dejected 1
but 1
we 1
wedged 1
in 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
we 1
could 1
and 1
soon 1
found 1
ourselves 1
in 1
the 1
office 1
Your 1
experience 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
most 1
entertaining 1
one 1
remarked 1
Holmes 1
as 1
his 1
client 1
paused 1
and 1
refreshed 1
his 1
memory 1
with 1
a 1
huge 1
pinch 1
of 1
snuff 1
Pray 1
continue 1
your 1
very 1
interesting 1
statement 1
There 1
was 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
office 1
but 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
wooden 1
chairs 1
and 1
a 1
deal 1
table 1
behind 1
which 1
sat 1
a 1
small 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
head 1
that 1
was 1
even 1
redder 1
than 1
mine 1
He 1
said 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
to 1
each 1
candidate 1
as 1
he 1
came 1
up 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
always 1
managed 1
to 1
find 1
some 1
fault 1
in 1
them 1
which 1
would 1
disqualify 1
them 1
Getting 1
a 1
vacancy 1
did 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
such 1
a 1
very 1
easy 1
matter 1
after 1
all 1
However 1
when 1
our 1
turn 1
came 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
was 1
much 1
more 1
favourable 1
to 1
me 1
than 1
to 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
others 1
and 1
he 1
closed 1
the 1
door 1
as 1
we 1
entered 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
a 1
private 1
word 1
with 1
us 1
This 1
is 1
Mr 1
Jabez 1
Wilson 1
said 1
my 1
assistant 1
and 1
he 1
is 1
willing 1
to 1
fill 1
a 1
vacancy 1
in 1
the 1
League 1
And 1
he 1
is 1
admirably 1
suited 1
for 1
it 1
the 1
other 1
answered 1
He 1
has 1
every 1
requirement 1
I 1
cannot 1
recall 1
when 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
anything 1
so 1
fine 1
He 1
took 1
a 1
step 1
backward 1
cocked 1
his 1
head 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
gazed 1
at 1
my 1
hair 1
until 1
I 1
felt 1
quite 1
bashful 1
Then 1
suddenly 1
he 1
plunged 1
forward 1
wrung 1
my 1
hand 1
and 1
congratulated 1
me 1
warmly 1
on 1
my 1
success 1
It 1
would 1
be 1
injustice 1
to 1
hesitate 1
said 1
he 1
You 1
will 1
however 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
excuse 1
me 1
for 1
taking 1
an 1
obvious 1
precaution 1
With 1
that 1
he 1
seized 1
my 1
hair 1
in 1
both 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
tugged 1
until 1
I 1
yelled 1
with 1
the 1
pain 1
There 1
is 1
water 1
in 1
your 1
eyes 1
said 1
he 1
as 1
he 1
released 1
me 1
I 1
perceive 1
that 1
all 1
is 1
as 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
But 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
careful 1
for 1
we 1
have 1
twice 1
been 1
deceived 1
by 1
wigs 1
and 1
once 1
by 1
paint 1
I 1
could 1
tell 1
you 1
tales 1
of 1
cobbler 1
s 1
wax 1
which 1
would 1
disgust 1
you 1
with 1
human 1
nature 1
He 1
stepped 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
shouted 1
through 1
it 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
his 1
voice 1
that 1
the 1
vacancy 1
was 1
filled 1
A 1
groan 1
of 1
disappointment 1
came 1
up 1
from 1
below 1
and 1
the 1
folk 1
all 1
trooped 1
away 1
in 1
different 1
directions 1
until 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
red 1
head 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
except 1
my 1
own 1
and 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
manager 1
My 1
name 1
said 1
he 1
is 1
Mr 1
Duncan 1
Ross 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
myself 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
pensioners 1
upon 1
the 1
fund 1
left 1
by 1
our 1
noble 1
benefactor 1
Are 1
you 1
a 1
married 1
man 1
Mr 1
Wilson 1
Have 1
you 1
a 1
family 1
I 1
answered 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
His 1
face 1
fell 1
immediately 1
Dear 1
me 1
he 1
said 1
gravely 1
that 1
is 1
very 1
serious 1
indeed 1
I 1
am 1
sorry 1
to 1
hear 1
you 1
say 1
that 1
The 1
fund 1
was 1
of 1
course 1
for 1
the 1
propagation 1
and 1
spread 1
of 1
the 1
red 1
heads 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
for 1
their 1
maintenance 1
It 1
is 1
exceedingly 1
unfortunate 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
be 1
a 1
bachelor 1
My 1
face 1
lengthened 1
at 1
this 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
for 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
vacancy 1
after 1
all 1
but 1
after 1
thinking 1
it 1
over 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
all 1
right 1
In 1
the 1
case 1
of 1
another 1
said 1
he 1
the 1
objection 1
might 1
be 1
fatal 1
but 1
we 1
must 1
stretch 1
a 1
point 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
head 1
of 1
hair 1
as 1
yours 1
When 1
shall 1
you 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
enter 1
upon 1
your 1
new 1
duties 1
Well 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
awkward 1
for 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
business 1
already 1
said 1
I 1
Oh 1
never 1
mind 1
about 1
that 1
Mr 1
Wilson 1
said 1
Vincent 1
Spaulding 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
look 1
after 1
that 1
for 1
you 1
What 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
hours 1
I 1
asked 1
Ten 1
to 1
two 1
Now 1
a 1
pawnbroker 1
s 1
business 1
is 1
mostly 1
done 1
of 1
an 1
evening 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
especially 1
Thursday 1
and 1
Friday 1
evening 1
which 1
is 1
just 1
before 1
pay 1
day 1
so 1
it 1
would 1
suit 1
me 1
very 1
well 1
to 1
earn 1
a 1
little 1
in 1
the 1
mornings 1
Besides 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
my 1
assistant 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
man 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
see 1
to 1
anything 1
that 1
turned 1
up 1
That 1
would 1
suit 1
me 1
very 1
well 1
said 1
I 1
And 1
the 1
pay 1
Is 1
pounds 1
a 1
week 1
And 1
the 1
work 1
Is 1
purely 1
nominal 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
call 1
purely 1
nominal 1
Well 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
office 1
or 1
at 1
least 1
in 1
the 1
building 1
the 1
whole 1
time 1
If 1
you 1
leave 1
you 1
forfeit 1
your 1
whole 1
position 1
forever 1
The 1
will 1
is 1
very 1
clear 1
upon 1
that 1
point 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
comply 1
with 1
the 1
conditions 1
if 1
you 1
budge 1
from 1
the 1
office 1
during 1
that 1
time 1
It 1
s 1
only 1
four 1
hours 1
a 1
day 1
and 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
think 1
of 1
leaving 1
said 1
I 1
No 1
excuse 1
will 1
avail 1
said 1
Mr 1
Duncan 1
Ross 1
neither 1
sickness 1
nor 1
business 1
nor 1
anything 1
else 1
There 1
you 1
must 1
stay 1
or 1
you 1
lose 1
your 1
billet 1
And 1
the 1
work 1
Is 1
to 1
copy 1
out 1
the 1
Encyclopaedia 1
Britannica 1
There 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
volume 1
of 1
it 1
in 1
that 1
press 1
You 1
must 1
find 1
your 1
own 1
ink 1
pens 1
and 1
blotting 1
paper 1
but 1
we 1
provide 1
this 1
table 1
and 1
chair 1
Will 1
you 1
be 1
ready 1
to 1
morrow 1
Certainly 1
I 1
answered 1
Then 1
good 1
bye 1
Mr 1
Jabez 1
Wilson 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
congratulate 1
you 1
once 1
more 1
on 1
the 1
important 1
position 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
fortunate 1
enough 1
to 1
gain 1
He 1
bowed 1
me 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
I 1
went 1
home 1
with 1
my 1
assistant 1
hardly 1
knowing 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
or 1
do 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
pleased 1
at 1
my 1
own 1
good 1
fortune 1
Well 1
I 1
thought 1
over 1
the 1
matter 1
all 1
day 1
and 1
by 1
evening 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
low 1
spirits 1
again 1
for 1
I 1
had 1
quite 1
persuaded 1
myself 1
that 1
the 1
whole 1
affair 1
must 1
be 1
some 1
great 1
hoax 1
or 1
fraud 1
though 1
what 1
its 1
object 1
might 1
be 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
imagine 1
It 1
seemed 1
altogether 1
past 1
belief 1
that 1
anyone 1
could 1
make 1
such 1
a 1
will 1
or 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
pay 1
such 1
a 1
sum 1
for 1
doing 1
anything 1
so 1
simple 1
as 1
copying 1
out 1
the 1
Encyclopaedia 1
Britannica 1
Vincent 1
Spaulding 1
did 1
what 1
he 1
could 1
to 1
cheer 1
me 1
up 1
but 1
by 1
bedtime 1
I 1
had 1
reasoned 1
myself 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
However 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
I 1
determined 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
anyhow 1
so 1
I 1
bought 1
a 1
penny 1
bottle 1
of 1
ink 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
quill 1
pen 1
and 1
seven 1
sheets 1
of 1
foolscap 1
paper 1
I 1
started 1
off 1
for 1
Pope 1
s 1
Court 1
Well 1
to 1
my 1
surprise 1
and 1
delight 1
everything 1
was 1
as 1
right 1
as 1
possible 1
The 1
table 1
was 1
set 1
out 1
ready 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
Mr 1
Duncan 1
Ross 1
was 1
there 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
I 1
got 1
fairly 1
to 1
work 1
He 1
started 1
me 1
off 1
upon 1
the 1
letter 1
A 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
left 1
me 1
but 1
he 1
would 1
drop 1
in 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
all 1
was 1
right 1
with 1
me 1
At 1
two 1
o 1
clock 1
he 1
bade 1
me 1
good 1
day 1
complimented 1
me 1
upon 1
the 1
amount 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
written 1
and 1
locked 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
office 1
after 1
me 1
This 1
went 1
on 1
day 1
after 1
day 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
and 1
on 1
Saturday 1
the 1
manager 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
planked 1
down 1
four 1
golden 1
sovereigns 1
for 1
my 1
week 1
s 1
work 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
next 1
week 1
and 1
the 1
same 1
the 1
week 1
after 1
Every 1
morning 1
I 1
was 1
there 1
at 1
ten 1
and 1
every 1
afternoon 1
I 1
left 1
at 1
two 1
By 1
degrees 1
Mr 1
Duncan 1
Ross 1
took 1
to 1
coming 1
in 1
only 1
once 1
of 1
a 1
morning 1
and 1
then 1
after 1
a 1
time 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
in 1
at 1
all 1
Still 1
of 1
course 1
I 1
never 1
dared 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
room 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
for 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
sure 1
when 1
he 1
might 1
come 1
and 1
the 1
billet 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
good 1
one 1
and 1
suited 1
me 1
so 1
well 1
that 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
risk 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
it 1
Eight 1
weeks 1
passed 1
away 1
like 1
this 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
written 1
about 1
Abbots 1
and 1
Archery 1
and 1
Armour 1
and 1
Architecture 1
and 1
Attica 1
and 1
hoped 1
with 1
diligence 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
get 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
B 1
s 1
before 1
very 1
long 1
It 1
cost 1
me 1
something 1
in 1
foolscap 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
pretty 1
nearly 1
filled 1
a 1
shelf 1
with 1
my 1
writings 1
And 1
then 1
suddenly 1
the 1
whole 1
business 1
came 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
To 1
an 1
end 1
Yes 1
sir 1
And 1
no 1
later 1
than 1
this 1
morning 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
my 1
work 1
as 1
usual 1
at 1
ten 1
o 1
clock 1
but 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
shut 1
and 1
locked 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
square 1
of 1
cardboard 1
hammered 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
panel 1
with 1
a 1
tack 1
Here 1
it 1
is 1
and 1
you 1
can 1
read 1
for 1
yourself 1
He 1
held 1
up 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
white 1
cardboard 1
about 1
the 1
size 1
of 1
a 1
sheet 1
of 1
note 1
paper 1
It 1
read 1
in 1
this 1
fashion 1
THE 1
RED 1
HEADED 1
LEAGUE 1
IS 1
DISSOLVED 1
October 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
and 1
I 1
surveyed 1
this 1
curt 1
announcement 1
and 1
the 1
rueful 1
face 1
behind 1
it 1
until 1
the 1
comical 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
affair 1
so 1
completely 1
overtopped 1
every 1
other 1
consideration 1
that 1
we 1
both 1
burst 1
out 1
into 1
a 1
roar 1
of 1
laughter 1
I 1
cannot 1
see 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
anything 1
very 1
funny 1
cried 1
our 1
client 1
flushing 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
roots 1
of 1
his 1
flaming 1
head 1
If 1
you 1
can 1
do 1
nothing 1
better 1
than 1
laugh 1
at 1
me 1
I 1
can 1
go 1
elsewhere 1
No 1
no 1
cried 1
Holmes 1
shoving 1
him 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
chair 1
from 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
half 1
risen 1
I 1
really 1
wouldn 1
t 1
miss 1
your 1
case 1
for 1
the 1
world 1
It 1
is 1
most 1
refreshingly 1
unusual 1
But 1
there 1
is 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
excuse 1
my 1
saying 1
so 1
something 1
just 1
a 1
little 1
funny 1
about 1
it 1
Pray 1
what 1
steps 1
did 1
you 1
take 1
when 1
you 1
found 1
the 1
card 1
upon 1
the 1
door 1
I 1
was 1
staggered 1
sir 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
Then 1
I 1
called 1
at 1
the 1
offices 1
round 1
but 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
seemed 1
to 1
know 1
anything 1
about 1
it 1
Finally 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
landlord 1
who 1
is 1
an 1
accountant 1
living 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
floor 1
and 1
I 1
asked 1
him 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
had 1
become 1
of 1
the 1
Red 1
headed 1
League 1
He 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
heard 1
of 1
any 1
such 1
body 1
Then 1
I 1
asked 1
him 1
who 1
Mr 1
Duncan 1
Ross 1
was 1
He 1
answered 1
that 1
the 1
name 1
was 1
new 1
to 1
him 1
Well 1
said 1
I 1
the 1
gentleman 1
at 1
No 1
What 1
the 1
red 1
headed 1
man 1
Yes 1
Oh 1
said 1
he 1
his 1
name 1
was 1
William 1
Morris 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
solicitor 1
and 1
was 1
using 1
my 1
room 1
as 1
a 1
temporary 1
convenience 1
until 1
his 1
new 1
premises 1
were 1
ready 1
He 1
moved 1
out 1
yesterday 1
Where 1
could 1
I 1
find 1
him 1
Oh 1
at 1
his 1
new 1
offices 1
He 1
did 1
tell 1
me 1
the 1
address 1
Yes 1
King 1
Edward 1
Street 1
near 1
St 1
Paul 1
s 1
I 1
started 1
off 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
but 1
when 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
that 1
address 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
manufactory 1
of 1
artificial 1
knee 1
caps 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
in 1
it 1
had 1
ever 1
heard 1
of 1
either 1
Mr 1
William 1
Morris 1
or 1
Mr 1
Duncan 1
Ross 1
And 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
do 1
then 1
asked 1
Holmes 1
I 1
went 1
home 1
to 1
Saxe 1
Coburg 1
Square 1
and 1
I 1
took 1
the 1
advice 1
of 1
my 1
assistant 1
But 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
me 1
in 1
any 1
way 1
He 1
could 1
only 1
say 1
that 1
if 1
I 1
waited 1
I 1
should 1
hear 1
by 1
post 1
But 1
that 1
was 1
not 1
quite 1
good 1
enough 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
lose 1
such 1
a 1
place 1
without 1
a 1
struggle 1
so 1
as 1
I 1
had 1
heard 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
give 1
advice 1
to 1
poor 1
folk 1
who 1
were 1
in 1
need 1
of 1
it 1
I 1
came 1
right 1
away 1
to 1
you 1
And 1
you 1
did 1
very 1
wisely 1
said 1
Holmes 1
Your 1
case 1
is 1
an 1
exceedingly 1
remarkable 1
one 1
and 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
happy 1
to 1
look 1
into 1
it 1
From 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
told 1
me 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
possible 1
that 1
graver 1
issues 1
hang 1
from 1
it 1
than 1
might 1
at 1
first 1
sight 1
appear 1
Grave 1
enough 1
said 1
Mr 1
Jabez 1
Wilson 1
Why 1
I 1
have 1
lost 1
four 1
pound 1
a 1
week 1
As 1
far 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
personally 1
concerned 1
remarked 1
Holmes 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
see 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
any 1
grievance 1
against 1
this 1
extraordinary 1
league 1
On 1
the 1
contrary 1
you 1
are 1
as 1
I 1
understand 1
richer 1
by 1
some 1
pounds 1
to 1
say 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
minute 1
knowledge 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
gained 1
on 1
every 1
subject 1
which 1
comes 1
under 1
the 1
letter 1
A 1
You 1
have 1
lost 1
nothing 1
by 1
them 1
No 1
sir 1
But 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
about 1
them 1
and 1
who 1
they 1
are 1
and 1
what 1
their 1
object 1
was 1
in 1
playing 1
this 1
prank 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
prank 1
upon 1
me 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
pretty 1
expensive 1
joke 1
for 1
them 1
for 1
it 1
cost 1
them 1
two 1
and 1
thirty 1
pounds 1
We 1
shall 1
endeavour 1
to 1
clear 1
up 1
these 1
points 1
for 1
you 1
And 1
first 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
questions 1
Mr 1
Wilson 1
This 1
assistant 1
of 1
yours 1
who 1
first 1
called 1
your 1
attention 1
to 1
the 1
advertisement 1
how 1
long 1
had 1
he 1
been 1
with 1
you 1
About 1
a 1
month 1
then 1
How 1
did 1
he 1
come 1
In 1
answer 1
to 1
an 1
advertisement 1
Was 1
he 1
the 1
only 1
applicant 1
No 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
dozen 1
Why 1
did 1
you 1
pick 1
him 1
Because 1
he 1
was 1
handy 1
and 1
would 1
come 1
cheap 1
At 1
half 1
wages 1
in 1
fact 1
Yes 1
What 1
is 1
he 1
like 1
this 1
Vincent 1
Spaulding 1
Small 1
stout 1
built 1
very 1
quick 1
in 1
his 1
ways 1
no 1
hair 1
on 1
his 1
face 1
though 1
he 1
s 1
not 1
short 1
of 1
thirty 1
Has 1
a 1
white 1
splash 1
of 1
acid 1
upon 1
his 1
forehead 1
Holmes 1
sat 1
up 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
in 1
considerable 1
excitement 1
I 1
thought 1
as 1
much 1
said 1
he 1
Have 1
you 1
ever 1
observed 1
that 1
his 1
ears 1
are 1
pierced 1
for 1
earrings 1
Yes 1
sir 1
He 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
a 1
gipsy 1
had 1
done 1
it 1
for 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
lad 1
Hum 1
said 1
Holmes 1
sinking 1
back 1
in 1
deep 1
thought 1
He 1
is 1
still 1
with 1
you 1
Oh 1
yes 1
sir 1
I 1
have 1
only 1
just 1
left 1
him 1
And 1
has 1
your 1
business 1
been 1
attended 1
to 1
in 1
your 1
absence 1
Nothing 1
to 1
complain 1
of 1
sir 1
There 1
s 1
never 1
very 1
much 1
to 1
do 1
of 1
a 1
morning 1
That 1
will 1
do 1
Mr 1
Wilson 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
happy 1
to 1
give 1
you 1
an 1
opinion 1
upon 1
the 1
subject 1
in 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
a 1
day 1
or 1
two 1
To 1
day 1
is 1
Saturday 1
and 1
I 1
hope 1
that 1
by 1
Monday 1
we 1
may 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
conclusion 1
Well 1
Watson 1
said 1
Holmes 1
when 1
our 1
visitor 1
had 1
left 1
us 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
make 1
of 1
it 1
all 1
I 1
make 1
nothing 1
of 1
it 1
I 1
answered 1
frankly 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
most 1
mysterious 1
business 1
As 1
a 1
rule 1
said 1
Holmes 1
the 1
more 1
bizarre 1
a 1
thing 1
is 1
the 1
less 1
mysterious 1
it 1
proves 1
to 1
be 1
It 1
is 1
your 1
commonplace 1
featureless 1
crimes 1
which 1
are 1
really 1
puzzling 1
just 1
as 1
a 1
commonplace 1
face 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
difficult 1
to 1
identify 1
But 1
I 1
must 1
be 1
prompt 1
over 1
this 1
matter 1
What 1
are 1
you 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
then 1
I 1
asked 1
To 1
smoke 1
he 1
answered 1
It 1
is 1
quite 1
a 1
three 1
pipe 1
problem 1
and 1
I 1
beg 1
that 1
you 1
won 1
t 1
speak 1
to 1
me 1
for 1
fifty 1
minutes 1
He 1
curled 1
himself 1
up 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
with 1
his 1
thin 1
knees 1
drawn 1
up 1
to 1
his 1
hawk 1
like 1
nose 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
sat 1
with 1
his 1
eyes 1
closed 1
and 1
his 1
black 1
clay 1
pipe 1
thrusting 1
out 1
like 1
the 1
bill 1
of 1
some 1
strange 1
bird 1
I 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
conclusion 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
dropped 1
asleep 1
and 1
indeed 1
was 1
nodding 1
myself 1
when 1
he 1
suddenly 1
sprang 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
chair 1
with 1
the 1
gesture 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
has 1
made 1
up 1
his 1
mind 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
pipe 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
mantelpiece 1
Sarasate 1
plays 1
at 1
the 1
St 1
James 1
s 1
Hall 1
this 1
afternoon 1
he 1
remarked 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
Watson 1
Could 1
your 1
patients 1
spare 1
you 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
I 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
to 1
day 1
My 1
practice 1
is 1
never 1
very 1
absorbing 1
Then 1
put 1
on 1
your 1
hat 1
and 1
come 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
through 1
the 1
City 1
first 1
and 1
we 1
can 1
have 1
some 1
lunch 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
I 1
observe 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
of 1
German 1
music 1
on 1
the 1
programme 1
which 1
is 1
rather 1
more 1
to 1
my 1
taste 1
than 1
Italian 1
or 1
French 1
It 1
is 1
introspective 1
and 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
introspect 1
Come 1
along 1
We 1
travelled 1
by 1
the 1
Underground 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
Aldersgate 1
and 1
a 1
short 1
walk 1
took 1
us 1
to 1
Saxe 1
Coburg 1
Square 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
singular 1
story 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
listened 1
to 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
poky 1
little 1
shabby 1
genteel 1
place 1
where 1
four 1
lines 1
of 1
dingy 1
two 1
storied 1
brick 1
houses 1
looked 1
out 1
into 1
a 1
small 1
railed 1
in 1
enclosure 1
where 1
a 1
lawn 1
of 1
weedy 1
grass 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
clumps 1
of 1
faded 1
laurel 1
bushes 1
made 1
a 1
hard 1
fight 1
against 1
a 1
smoke 1
laden 1
and 1
uncongenial 1
atmosphere 1
Three 1
gilt 1
balls 1
and 1
a 1
brown 1
board 1
with 1
JABEZ 1
WILSON 1
in 1
white 1
letters 1
upon 1
a 1
corner 1
house 1
announced 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
our 1
red 1
headed 1
client 1
carried 1
on 1
his 1
business 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
stopped 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
looked 1
it 1
all 1
over 1
with 1
his 1
eyes 1
shining 1
brightly 1
between 1
puckered 1
lids 1
Then 1
he 1
walked 1
slowly 1
up 1
the 1
street 1
and 1
then 1
down 1
again 1
to 1
the 1
corner 1
still 1
looking 1
keenly 1
at 1
the 1
houses 1
Finally 1
he 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
pawnbroker 1
s 1
and 1
having 1
thumped 1
vigorously 1
upon 1
the 1
pavement 1
with 1
his 1
stick 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
times 1
he 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
knocked 1
It 1
was 1
instantly 1
opened 1
by 1
a 1
bright 1
looking 1
clean 1
shaven 1
young 1
fellow 1
who 1
asked 1
him 1
to 1
step 1
in 1
Thank 1
you 1
said 1
Holmes 1
I 1
only 1
wished 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
how 1
you 1
would 1
go 1
from 1
here 1
to 1
the 1
Strand 1
Third 1
right 1
fourth 1
left 1
answered 1
the 1
assistant 1
promptly 1
closing 1
the 1
door 1
Smart 1
fellow 1
that 1
observed 1
Holmes 1
as 1
we 1
walked 1
away 1
He 1
is 1
in 1
my 1
judgment 1
the 1
fourth 1
smartest 1
man 1
in 1
London 1
and 1
for 1
daring 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
sure 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
not 1
a 1
claim 1
to 1
be 1
third 1
I 1
have 1
known 1
something 1
of 1
him 1
before 1
Evidently 1
said 1
I 1
Mr 1
Wilson 1
s 1
assistant 1
counts 1
for 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
in 1
this 1
mystery 1
of 1
the 1
Red 1
headed 1
League 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
that 1
you 1
inquired 1
your 1
way 1
merely 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
you 1
might 1
see 1
him 1
Not 1
him 1
What 1
then 1
The 1
knees 1
of 1
his 1
trousers 1
And 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
see 1
What 1
I 1
expected 1
to 1
see 1
Why 1
did 1
you 1
beat 1
the 1
pavement 1
My 1
dear 1
doctor 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
time 1
for 1
observation 1
not 1
for 1
talk 1
We 1
are 1
spies 1
in 1
an 1
enemy 1
s 1
country 1
We 1
know 1
something 1
of 1
Saxe 1
Coburg 1
Square 1
Let 1
us 1
now 1
explore 1
the 1
parts 1
which 1
lie 1
behind 1
it 1
The 1
road 1
in 1
which 1
we 1
found 1
ourselves 1
as 1
we 1
turned 1
round 1
the 1
corner 1
from 1
the 1
retired 1
Saxe 1
Coburg 1
Square 1
presented 1
as 1
great 1
a 1
contrast 1
to 1
it 1
as 1
the 1
front 1
of 1
a 1
picture 1
does 1
to 1
the 1
back 1
It 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
main 1
arteries 1
which 1
conveyed 1
the 1
traffic 1
of 1
the 1
City 1
to 1
the 1
north 1
and 1
west 1
The 1
roadway 1
was 1
blocked 1
with 1
the 1
immense 1
stream 1
of 1
commerce 1
flowing 1
in 1
a 1
double 1
tide 1
inward 1
and 1
outward 1
while 1
the 1
footpaths 1
were 1
black 1
with 1
the 1
hurrying 1
swarm 1
of 1
pedestrians 1
It 1
was 1
difficult 1
to 1
realise 1
as 1
we 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
line 1
of 1
fine 1
shops 1
and 1
stately 1
business 1
premises 1
that 1
they 1
really 1
abutted 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
upon 1
the 1
faded 1
and 1
stagnant 1
square 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
just 1
quitted 1
Let 1
me 1
see 1
said 1
Holmes 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
corner 1
and 1
glancing 1
along 1
the 1
line 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
just 1
to 1
remember 1
the 1
order 1
of 1
the 1
houses 1
here 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
hobby 1
of 1
mine 1
to 1
have 1
an 1
exact 1
knowledge 1
of 1
London 1
There 1
is 1
Mortimer 1
s 1
the 1
tobacconist 1
the 1
little 1
newspaper 1
shop 1
the 1
Coburg 1
branch 1
of 1
the 1
City 1
and 1
Suburban 1
Bank 1
the 1
Vegetarian 1
Restaurant 1
and 1
McFarlane 1
s 1
carriage 1
building 1
depot 1
That 1
carries 1
us 1
right 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
block 1
And 1
now 1
Doctor 1
we 1
ve 1
done 1
our 1
work 1
so 1
it 1
s 1
time 1
we 1
had 1
some 1
play 1
A 1
sandwich 1
and 1
a 1
cup 1
of 1
coffee 1
and 1
then 1
off 1
to 1
violin 1
land 1
where 1
all 1
is 1
sweetness 1
and 1
delicacy 1
and 1
harmony 1
and 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
red 1
headed 1
clients 1
to 1
vex 1
us 1
with 1
their 1
conundrums 1
My 1
friend 1
was 1
an 1
enthusiastic 1
musician 1
being 1
himself 1
not 1
only 1
a 1
very 1
capable 1
performer 1
but 1
a 1
composer 1
of 1
no 1
ordinary 1
merit 1
All 1
the 1
afternoon 1
he 1
sat 1
in 1
the 1
stalls 1
wrapped 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
perfect 1
happiness 1
gently 1
waving 1
his 1
long 1
thin 1
fingers 1
in 1
time 1
to 1
the 1
music 1
while 1
his 1
gently 1
smiling 1
face 1
and 1
his 1
languid 1
dreamy 1
eyes 1
were 1
as 1
unlike 1
those 1
of 1
Holmes 1
the 1
sleuth 1
hound 1
Holmes 1
the 1
relentless 1
keen 1
witted 1
ready 1
handed 1
criminal 1
agent 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
possible 1
to 1
conceive 1
In 1
his 1
singular 1
character 1
the 1
dual 1
nature 1
alternately 1
asserted 1
itself 1
and 1
his 1
extreme 1
exactness 1
and 1
astuteness 1
represented 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
often 1
thought 1
the 1
reaction 1
against 1
the 1
poetic 1
and 1
contemplative 1
mood 1
which 1
occasionally 1
predominated 1
in 1
him 1
The 1
swing 1
of 1
his 1
nature 1
took 1
him 1
from 1
extreme 1
languor 1
to 1
devouring 1
energy 1
and 1
as 1
I 1
knew 1
well 1
he 1
was 1
never 1
so 1
truly 1
formidable 1
as 1
when 1
for 1
days 1
on 1
end 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
lounging 1
in 1
his 1
armchair 1
amid 1
his 1
improvisations 1
and 1
his 1
black 1
letter 1
editions 1
Then 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
the 1
lust 1
of 1
the 1
chase 1
would 1
suddenly 1
come 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
that 1
his 1
brilliant 1
reasoning 1
power 1
would 1
rise 1
to 1
the 1
level 1
of 1
intuition 1
until 1
those 1
who 1
were 1
unacquainted 1
with 1
his 1
methods 1
would 1
look 1
askance 1
at 1
him 1
as 1
on 1
a 1
man 1
whose 1
knowledge 1
was 1
not 1
that 1
of 1
other 1
mortals 1
When 1
I 1
saw 1
him 1
that 1
afternoon 1
so 1
enwrapped 1
in 1
the 1
music 1
at 1
St 1
James 1
s 1
Hall 1
I 1
felt 1
that 1
an 1
evil 1
time 1
might 1
be 1
coming 1
upon 1
those 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
set 1
himself 1
to 1
hunt 1
down 1
You 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
no 1
doubt 1
Doctor 1
he 1
remarked 1
as 1
we 1
emerged 1
Yes 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
as 1
well 1
And 1
I 1
have 1
some 1
business 1
to 1
do 1
which 1
will 1
take 1
some 1
hours 1
This 1
business 1
at 1
Coburg 1
Square 1
is 1
serious 1
Why 1
serious 1
A 1
considerable 1
crime 1
is 1
in 1
contemplation 1
I 1
have 1
every 1
reason 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
in 1
time 1
to 1
stop 1
it 1
But 1
to 1
day 1
being 1
Saturday 1
rather 1
complicates 1
matters 1
I 1
shall 1
want 1
your 1
help 1
to 1
night 1
At 1
what 1
time 1
Ten 1
will 1
be 1
early 1
enough 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
at 1
Baker 1
Street 1
at 1
ten 1
Very 1
well 1
And 1
I 1
say 1
Doctor 1
there 1
may 1
be 1
some 1
little 1
danger 1
so 1
kindly 1
put 1
your 1
army 1
revolver 1
in 1
your 1
pocket 1
He 1
waved 1
his 1
hand 1
turned 1
on 1
his 1
heel 1
and 1
disappeared 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
among 1
the 1
crowd 1
I 1
trust 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
more 1
dense 1
than 1
my 1
neighbours 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
always 1
oppressed 1
with 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
stupidity 1
in 1
my 1
dealings 1
with 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
Here 1
I 1
had 1
heard 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
I 1
had 1
seen 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
and 1
yet 1
from 1
his 1
words 1
it 1
was 1
evident 1
that 1
he 1
saw 1
clearly 1
not 1
only 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
but 1
what 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
happen 1
while 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
whole 1
business 1
was 1
still 1
confused 1
and 1
grotesque 1
As 1
I 1
drove 1
home 1
to 1
my 1
house 1
in 1
Kensington 1
I 1
thought 1
over 1
it 1
all 1
from 1
the 1
extraordinary 1
story 1
of 1
the 1
red 1
headed 1
copier 1
of 1
the 1
Encyclopaedia 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
visit 1
to 1
Saxe 1
Coburg 1
Square 1
and 1
the 1
ominous 1
words 1
with 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
parted 1
from 1
me 1
What 1
was 1
this 1
nocturnal 1
expedition 1
and 1
why 1
should 1
I 1
go 1
armed 1
Where 1
were 1
we 1
going 1
and 1
what 1
were 1
we 1
to 1
do 1
I 1
had 1
the 1
hint 1
from 1
Holmes 1
that 1
this 1
smooth 1
faced 1
pawnbroker 1
s 1
assistant 1
was 1
a 1
formidable 1
man 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
might 1
play 1
a 1
deep 1
game 1
I 1
tried 1
to 1
puzzle 1
it 1
out 1
but 1
gave 1
it 1
up 1
in 1
despair 1
and 1
set 1
the 1
matter 1
aside 1
until 1
night 1
should 1
bring 1
an 1
explanation 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
quarter 1
past 1
nine 1
when 1
I 1
started 1
from 1
home 1
and 1
made 1
my 1
way 1
across 1
the 1
Park 1
and 1
so 1
through 1
Oxford 1
Street 1
to 1
Baker 1
Street 1
Two 1
hansoms 1
were 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
as 1
I 1
entered 1
the 1
passage 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
voices 1
from 1
above 1
On 1
entering 1
his 1
room 1
I 1
found 1
Holmes 1
in 1
animated 1
conversation 1
with 1
two 1
men 1
one 1
of 1
whom 1
I 1
recognised 1
as 1
Peter 1
Jones 1
the 1
official 1
police 1
agent 1
while 1
the 1
other 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
thin 1
sad 1
faced 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
shiny 1
hat 1
and 1
oppressively 1
respectable 1
frock 1
coat 1
Ha 1
Our 1
party 1
is 1
complete 1
said 1
Holmes 1
buttoning 1
up 1
his 1
pea 1
jacket 1
and 1
taking 1
his 1
heavy 1
hunting 1
crop 1
from 1
the 1
rack 1
Watson 1
I 1
think 1
you 1
know 1
Mr 1
Jones 1
of 1
Scotland 1
Yard 1
Let 1
me 1
introduce 1
you 1
to 1
Mr 1
Merryweather 1
who 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
our 1
companion 1
in 1
to 1
night 1
s 1
adventure 1
We 1
re 1
hunting 1
in 1
couples 1
again 1
Doctor 1
you 1
see 1
said 1
Jones 1
in 1
his 1
consequential 1
way 1
Our 1
friend 1
here 1
is 1
a 1
wonderful 1
man 1
for 1
starting 1
a 1
chase 1
All 1
he 1
wants 1
is 1
an 1
old 1
dog 1
to 1
help 1
him 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
running 1
down 1
I 1
hope 1
a 1
wild 1
goose 1
may 1
not 1
prove 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
our 1
chase 1
observed 1
Mr 1
Merryweather 1
gloomily 1
You 1
may 1
place 1
considerable 1
confidence 1
in 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
sir 1
said 1
the 1
police 1
agent 1
loftily 1
He 1
has 1
his 1
own 1
little 1
methods 1
which 1
are 1
if 1
he 1
won 1
t 1
mind 1
my 1
saying 1
so 1
just 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
theoretical 1
and 1
fantastic 1
but 1
he 1
has 1
the 1
makings 1
of 1
a 1
detective 1
in 1
him 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
too 1
much 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
as 1
in 1
that 1
business 1
of 1
the 1
Sholto 1
murder 1
and 1
the 1
Agra 1
treasure 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
more 1
nearly 1
correct 1
than 1
the 1
official 1
force 1
Oh 1
if 1
you 1
say 1
so 1
Mr 1
Jones 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
right 1
said 1
the 1
stranger 1
with 1
deference 1
Still 1
I 1
confess 1
that 1
I 1
miss 1
my 1
rubber 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
Saturday 1
night 1
for 1
seven 1
and 1
twenty 1
years 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
had 1
my 1
rubber 1
I 1
think 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
said 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
play 1
for 1
a 1
higher 1
stake 1
to 1
night 1
than 1
you 1
have 1
ever 1
done 1
yet 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
play 1
will 1
be 1
more 1
exciting 1
For 1
you 1
Mr 1
Merryweather 1
the 1
stake 1
will 1
be 1
some 1
pounds 1
and 1
for 1
you 1
Jones 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
man 1
upon 1
whom 1
you 1
wish 1
to 1
lay 1
your 1
hands 1
John 1
Clay 1
the 1
murderer 1
thief 1
smasher 1
and 1
forger 1
He 1
s 1
a 1
young 1
man 1
Mr 1
Merryweather 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
his 1
profession 1
and 1
I 1
would 1
rather 1
have 1
my 1
bracelets 1
on 1
him 1
than 1
on 1
any 1
criminal 1
in 1
London 1
He 1
s 1
a 1
remarkable 1
man 1
is 1
young 1
John 1
Clay 1
His 1
grandfather 1
was 1
a 1
royal 1
duke 1
and 1
he 1
himself 1
has 1
been 1
to 1
Eton 1
and 1
Oxford 1
His 1
brain 1
is 1
as 1
cunning 1
as 1
his 1
fingers 1
and 1
though 1
we 1
meet 1
signs 1
of 1
him 1
at 1
every 1
turn 1
we 1
never 1
know 1
where 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
man 1
himself 1
He 1
ll 1
crack 1
a 1
crib 1
in 1
Scotland 1
one 1
week 1
and 1
be 1
raising 1
money 1
to 1
build 1
an 1
orphanage 1
in 1
Cornwall 1
the 1
next 1
I 1
ve 1
been 1
on 1
his 1
track 1
for 1
years 1
and 1
have 1
never 1
set 1
eyes 1
on 1
him 1
yet 1
I 1
hope 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
have 1
the 1
pleasure 1
of 1
introducing 1
you 1
to 1
night 1
I 1
ve 1
had 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
little 1
turns 1
also 1
with 1
Mr 1
John 1
Clay 1
and 1
I 1
agree 1
with 1
you 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
his 1
profession 1
It 1
is 1
past 1
ten 1
however 1
and 1
quite 1
time 1
that 1
we 1
started 1
If 1
you 1
two 1
will 1
take 1
the 1
first 1
hansom 1
Watson 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
follow 1
in 1
the 1
second 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
was 1
not 1
very 1
communicative 1
during 1
the 1
long 1
drive 1
and 1
lay 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
cab 1
humming 1
the 1
tunes 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
We 1
rattled 1
through 1
an 1
endless 1
labyrinth 1
of 1
gas 1
lit 1
streets 1
until 1
we 1
emerged 1
into 1
Farrington 1
Street 1
We 1
are 1
close 1
there 1
now 1
my 1
friend 1
remarked 1
This 1
fellow 1
Merryweather 1
is 1
a 1
bank 1
director 1
and 1
personally 1
interested 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
I 1
thought 1
it 1
as 1
well 1
to 1
have 1
Jones 1
with 1
us 1
also 1
He 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
bad 1
fellow 1
though 1
an 1
absolute 1
imbecile 1
in 1
his 1
profession 1
He 1
has 1
one 1
positive 1
virtue 1
He 1
is 1
as 1
brave 1
as 1
a 1
bulldog 1
and 1
as 1
tenacious 1
as 1
a 1
lobster 1
if 1
he 1
gets 1
his 1
claws 1
upon 1
anyone 1
Here 1
we 1
are 1
and 1
they 1
are 1
waiting 1
for 1
us 1
We 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
same 1
crowded 1
thoroughfare 1
in 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
found 1
ourselves 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
Our 1
cabs 1
were 1
dismissed 1
and 1
following 1
the 1
guidance 1
of 1
Mr 1
Merryweather 1
we 1
passed 1
down 1
a 1
narrow 1
passage 1
and 1
through 1
a 1
side 1
door 1
which 1
he 1
opened 1
for 1
us 1
Within 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
corridor 1
which 1
ended 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
massive 1
iron 1
gate 1
This 1
also 1
was 1
opened 1
and 1
led 1
down 1
a 1
flight 1
of 1
winding 1
stone 1
steps 1
which 1
terminated 1
at 1
another 1
formidable 1
gate 1
Mr 1
Merryweather 1
stopped 1
to 1
light 1
a 1
lantern 1
and 1
then 1
conducted 1
us 1
down 1
a 1
dark 1
earth 1
smelling 1
passage 1
and 1
so 1
after 1
opening 1
a 1
third 1
door 1
into 1
a 1
huge 1
vault 1
or 1
cellar 1
which 1
was 1
piled 1
all 1
round 1
with 1
crates 1
and 1
massive 1
boxes 1
You 1
are 1
not 1
very 1
vulnerable 1
from 1
above 1
Holmes 1
remarked 1
as 1
he 1
held 1
up 1
the 1
lantern 1
and 1
gazed 1
about 1
him 1
Nor 1
from 1
below 1
said 1
Mr 1
Merryweather 1
striking 1
his 1
stick 1
upon 1
the 1
flags 1
which 1
lined 1
the 1
floor 1
Why 1
dear 1
me 1
it 1
sounds 1
quite 1
hollow 1
he 1
remarked 1
looking 1
up 1
in 1
surprise 1
I 1
must 1
really 1
ask 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
quiet 1
said 1
Holmes 1
severely 1
You 1
have 1
already 1
imperilled 1
the 1
whole 1
success 1
of 1
our 1
expedition 1
Might 1
I 1
beg 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
the 1
goodness 1
to 1
sit 1
down 1
upon 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
boxes 1
and 1
not 1
to 1
interfere 1
The 1
solemn 1
Mr 1
Merryweather 1
perched 1
himself 1
upon 1
a 1
crate 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
injured 1
expression 1
upon 1
his 1
face 1
while 1
Holmes 1
fell 1
upon 1
his 1
knees 1
upon 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
lantern 1
and 1
a 1
magnifying 1
lens 1
began 1
to 1
examine 1
minutely 1
the 1
cracks 1
between 1
the 1
stones 1
A 1
few 1
seconds 1
sufficed 1
to 1
satisfy 1
him 1
for 1
he 1
sprang 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
again 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
glass 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
We 1
have 1
at 1
least 1
an 1
hour 1
before 1
us 1
he 1
remarked 1
for 1
they 1
can 1
hardly 1
take 1
any 1
steps 1
until 1
the 1
good 1
pawnbroker 1
is 1
safely 1
in 1
bed 1
Then 1
they 1
will 1
not 1
lose 1
a 1
minute 1
for 1
the 1
sooner 1
they 1
do 1
their 1
work 1
the 1
longer 1
time 1
they 1
will 1
have 1
for 1
their 1
escape 1
We 1
are 1
at 1
present 1
Doctor 1
as 1
no 1
doubt 1
you 1
have 1
divined 1
in 1
the 1
cellar 1
of 1
the 1
City 1
branch 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
principal 1
London 1
banks 1
Mr 1
Merryweather 1
is 1
the 1
chairman 1
of 1
directors 1
and 1
he 1
will 1
explain 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
reasons 1
why 1
the 1
more 1
daring 1
criminals 1
of 1
London 1
should 1
take 1
a 1
considerable 1
interest 1
in 1
this 1
cellar 1
at 1
present 1
It 1
is 1
our 1
French 1
gold 1
whispered 1
the 1
director 1
We 1
have 1
had 1
several 1
warnings 1
that 1
an 1
attempt 1
might 1
be 1
made 1
upon 1
it 1
Your 1
French 1
gold 1
Yes 1
We 1
had 1
occasion 1
some 1
months 1
ago 1
to 1
strengthen 1
our 1
resources 1
and 1
borrowed 1
for 1
that 1
purpose 1
napoleons 1
from 1
the 1
Bank 1
of 1
France 1
It 1
has 1
become 1
known 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
never 1
had 1
occasion 1
to 1
unpack 1
the 1
money 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
still 1
lying 1
in 1
our 1
cellar 1
The 1
crate 1
upon 1
which 1
I 1
sit 1
contains 1
napoleons 1
packed 1
between 1
layers 1
of 1
lead 1
foil 1
Our 1
reserve 1
of 1
bullion 1
is 1
much 1
larger 1
at 1
present 1
than 1
is 1
usually 1
kept 1
in 1
a 1
single 1
branch 1
office 1
and 1
the 1
directors 1
have 1
had 1
misgivings 1
upon 1
the 1
subject 1
Which 1
were 1
very 1
well 1
justified 1
observed 1
Holmes 1
And 1
now 1
it 1
is 1
time 1
that 1
we 1
arranged 1
our 1
little 1
plans 1
I 1
expect 1
that 1
within 1
an 1
hour 1
matters 1
will 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
head 1
In 1
the 1
meantime 1
Mr 1
Merryweather 1
we 1
must 1
put 1
the 1
screen 1
over 1
that 1
dark 1
lantern 1
And 1
sit 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
so 1
I 1
had 1
brought 1
a 1
pack 1
of 1
cards 1
in 1
my 1
pocket 1
and 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
as 1
we 1
were 1
a 1
partie 1
carree 1
you 1
might 1
have 1
your 1
rubber 1
after 1
all 1
But 1
I 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
enemy 1
s 1
preparations 1
have 1
gone 1
so 1
far 1
that 1
we 1
cannot 1
risk 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
a 1
light 1
And 1
first 1
of 1
all 1
we 1
must 1
choose 1
our 1
positions 1
These 1
are 1
daring 1
men 1
and 1
though 1
we 1
shall 1
take 1
them 1
at 1
a 1
disadvantage 1
they 1
may 1
do 1
us 1
some 1
harm 1
unless 1
we 1
are 1
careful 1
I 1
shall 1
stand 1
behind 1
this 1
crate 1
and 1
do 1
you 1
conceal 1
yourselves 1
behind 1
those 1
Then 1
when 1
I 1
flash 1
a 1
light 1
upon 1
them 1
close 1
in 1
swiftly 1
If 1
they 1
fire 1
Watson 1
have 1
no 1
compunction 1
about 1
shooting 1
them 1
down 1
I 1
placed 1
my 1
revolver 1
cocked 1
upon 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
wooden 1
case 1
behind 1
which 1
I 1
crouched 1
Holmes 1
shot 1
the 1
slide 1
across 1
the 1
front 1
of 1
his 1
lantern 1
and 1
left 1
us 1
in 1
pitch 1
darkness 1
such 1
an 1
absolute 1
darkness 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
never 1
before 1
experienced 1
The 1
smell 1
of 1
hot 1
metal 1
remained 1
to 1
assure 1
us 1
that 1
the 1
light 1
was 1
still 1
there 1
ready 1
to 1
flash 1
out 1
at 1
a 1
moment 1
s 1
notice 1
To 1
me 1
with 1
my 1
nerves 1
worked 1
up 1
to 1
a 1
pitch 1
of 1
expectancy 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
depressing 1
and 1
subduing 1
in 1
the 1
sudden 1
gloom 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
cold 1
dank 1
air 1
of 1
the 1
vault 1
They 1
have 1
but 1
one 1
retreat 1
whispered 1
Holmes 1
That 1
is 1
back 1
through 1
the 1
house 1
into 1
Saxe 1
Coburg 1
Square 1
I 1
hope 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
done 1
what 1
I 1
asked 1
you 1
Jones 1
I 1
have 1
an 1
inspector 1
and 1
two 1
officers 1
waiting 1
at 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
Then 1
we 1
have 1
stopped 1
all 1
the 1
holes 1
And 1
now 1
we 1
must 1
be 1
silent 1
and 1
wait 1
What 1
a 1
time 1
it 1
seemed 1
From 1
comparing 1
notes 1
afterwards 1
it 1
was 1
but 1
an 1
hour 1
and 1
a 1
quarter 1
yet 1
it 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
night 1
must 1
have 1
almost 1
gone 1
and 1
the 1
dawn 1
be 1
breaking 1
above 1
us 1
My 1
limbs 1
were 1
weary 1
and 1
stiff 1
for 1
I 1
feared 1
to 1
change 1
my 1
position 1
yet 1
my 1
nerves 1
were 1
worked 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
highest 1
pitch 1
of 1
tension 1
and 1
my 1
hearing 1
was 1
so 1
acute 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
only 1
hear 1
the 1
gentle 1
breathing 1
of 1
my 1
companions 1
but 1
I 1
could 1
distinguish 1
the 1
deeper 1
heavier 1
in 1
breath 1
of 1
the 1
bulky 1
Jones 1
from 1
the 1
thin 1
sighing 1
note 1
of 1
the 1
bank 1
director 1
From 1
my 1
position 1
I 1
could 1
look 1
over 1
the 1
case 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
floor 1
Suddenly 1
my 1
eyes 1
caught 1
the 1
glint 1
of 1
a 1
light 1
At 1
first 1
it 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
lurid 1
spark 1
upon 1
the 1
stone 1
pavement 1
Then 1
it 1
lengthened 1
out 1
until 1
it 1
became 1
a 1
yellow 1
line 1
and 1
then 1
without 1
any 1
warning 1
or 1
sound 1
a 1
gash 1
seemed 1
to 1
open 1
and 1
a 1
hand 1
appeared 1
a 1
white 1
almost 1
womanly 1
hand 1
which 1
felt 1
about 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
area 1
of 1
light 1
For 1
a 1
minute 1
or 1
more 1
the 1
hand 1
with 1
its 1
writhing 1
fingers 1
protruded 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
floor 1
Then 1
it 1
was 1
withdrawn 1
as 1
suddenly 1
as 1
it 1
appeared 1
and 1
all 1
was 1
dark 1
again 1
save 1
the 1
single 1
lurid 1
spark 1
which 1
marked 1
a 1
chink 1
between 1
the 1
stones 1
Its 1
disappearance 1
however 1
was 1
but 1
momentary 1
With 1
a 1
rending 1
tearing 1
sound 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
broad 1
white 1
stones 1
turned 1
over 1
upon 1
its 1
side 1
and 1
left 1
a 1
square 1
gaping 1
hole 1
through 1
which 1
streamed 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
a 1
lantern 1
Over 1
the 1
edge 1
there 1
peeped 1
a 1
clean 1
cut 1
boyish 1
face 1
which 1
looked 1
keenly 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
with 1
a 1
hand 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
aperture 1
drew 1
itself 1
shoulder 1
high 1
and 1
waist 1
high 1
until 1
one 1
knee 1
rested 1
upon 1
the 1
edge 1
In 1
another 1
instant 1
he 1
stood 1
at 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
hole 1
and 1
was 1
hauling 1
after 1
him 1
a 1
companion 1
lithe 1
and 1
small 1
like 1
himself 1
with 1
a 1
pale 1
face 1
and 1
a 1
shock 1
of 1
very 1
red 1
hair 1
It 1
s 1
all 1
clear 1
he 1
whispered 1
Have 1
you 1
the 1
chisel 1
and 1
the 1
bags 1
Great 1
Scott 1
Jump 1
Archie 1
jump 1
and 1
I 1
ll 1
swing 1
for 1
it 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
had 1
sprung 1
out 1
and 1
seized 1
the 1
intruder 1
by 1
the 1
collar 1
The 1
other 1
dived 1
down 1
the 1
hole 1
and 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
rending 1
cloth 1
as 1
Jones 1
clutched 1
at 1
his 1
skirts 1
The 1
light 1
flashed 1
upon 1
the 1
barrel 1
of 1
a 1
revolver 1
but 1
Holmes 1
hunting 1
crop 1
came 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
wrist 1
and 1
the 1
pistol 1
clinked 1
upon 1
the 1
stone 1
floor 1
It 1
s 1
no 1
use 1
John 1
Clay 1
said 1
Holmes 1
blandly 1
You 1
have 1
no 1
chance 1
at 1
all 1
So 1
I 1
see 1
the 1
other 1
answered 1
with 1
the 1
utmost 1
coolness 1
I 1
fancy 1
that 1
my 1
pal 1
is 1
all 1
right 1
though 1
I 1
see 1
you 1
have 1
got 1
his 1
coat 1
tails 1
There 1
are 1
three 1
men 1
waiting 1
for 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
said 1
Holmes 1
Oh 1
indeed 1
You 1
seem 1
to 1
have 1
done 1
the 1
thing 1
very 1
completely 1
I 1
must 1
compliment 1
you 1
And 1
I 1
you 1
Holmes 1
answered 1
Your 1
red 1
headed 1
idea 1
was 1
very 1
new 1
and 1
effective 1
You 1
ll 1
see 1
your 1
pal 1
again 1
presently 1
said 1
Jones 1
He 1
s 1
quicker 1
at 1
climbing 1
down 1
holes 1
than 1
I 1
am 1
Just 1
hold 1
out 1
while 1
I 1
fix 1
the 1
derbies 1
I 1
beg 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
touch 1
me 1
with 1
your 1
filthy 1
hands 1
remarked 1
our 1
prisoner 1
as 1
the 1
handcuffs 1
clattered 1
upon 1
his 1
wrists 1
You 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
aware 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
royal 1
blood 1
in 1
my 1
veins 1
Have 1
the 1
goodness 1
also 1
when 1
you 1
address 1
me 1
always 1
to 1
say 1
sir 1
and 1
please 1
All 1
right 1
said 1
Jones 1
with 1
a 1
stare 1
and 1
a 1
snigger 1
Well 1
would 1
you 1
please 1
sir 1
march 1
upstairs 1
where 1
we 1
can 1
get 1
a 1
cab 1
to 1
carry 1
your 1
Highness 1
to 1
the 1
police 1
station 1
That 1
is 1
better 1
said 1
John 1
Clay 1
serenely 1
He 1
made 1
a 1
sweeping 1
bow 1
to 1
the 1
three 1
of 1
us 1
and 1
walked 1
quietly 1
off 1
in 1
the 1
custody 1
of 1
the 1
detective 1
Really 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
said 1
Mr 1
Merryweather 1
as 1
we 1
followed 1
them 1
from 1
the 1
cellar 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
the 1
bank 1
can 1
thank 1
you 1
or 1
repay 1
you 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
detected 1
and 1
defeated 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
complete 1
manner 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
determined 1
attempts 1
at 1
bank 1
robbery 1
that 1
have 1
ever 1
come 1
within 1
my 1
experience 1
I 1
have 1
had 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
little 1
scores 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
to 1
settle 1
with 1
Mr 1
John 1
Clay 1
said 1
Holmes 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
at 1
some 1
small 1
expense 1
over 1
this 1
matter 1
which 1
I 1
shall 1
expect 1
the 1
bank 1
to 1
refund 1
but 1
beyond 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
amply 1
repaid 1
by 1
having 1
had 1
an 1
experience 1
which 1
is 1
in 1
many 1
ways 1
unique 1
and 1
by 1
hearing 1
the 1
very 1
remarkable 1
narrative 1
of 1
the 1
Red 1
headed 1
League 1
You 1
see 1
Watson 1
he 1
explained 1
in 1
the 1
early 1
hours 1
of 1
the 1
morning 1
as 1
we 1
sat 1
over 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
whisky 1
and 1
soda 1
in 1
Baker 1
Street 1
it 1
was 1
perfectly 1
obvious 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
that 1
the 1
only 1
possible 1
object 1
of 1
this 1
rather 1
fantastic 1
business 1
of 1
the 1
advertisement 1
of 1
the 1
League 1
and 1
the 1
copying 1
of 1
the 1
Encyclopaedia 1
must 1
be 1
to 1
get 1
this 1
not 1
over 1
bright 1
pawnbroker 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
for 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
hours 1
every 1
day 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
curious 1
way 1
of 1
managing 1
it 1
but 1
really 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
difficult 1
to 1
suggest 1
a 1
better 1
The 1
method 1
was 1
no 1
doubt 1
suggested 1
to 1
Clay 1
s 1
ingenious 1
mind 1
by 1
the 1
colour 1
of 1
his 1
accomplice 1
s 1
hair 1
The 1
pounds 1
a 1
week 1
was 1
a 1
lure 1
which 1
must 1
draw 1
him 1
and 1
what 1
was 1
it 1
to 1
them 1
who 1
were 1
playing 1
for 1
thousands 1
They 1
put 1
in 1
the 1
advertisement 1
one 1
rogue 1
has 1
the 1
temporary 1
office 1
the 1
other 1
rogue 1
incites 1
the 1
man 1
to 1
apply 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
together 1
they 1
manage 1
to 1
secure 1
his 1
absence 1
every 1
morning 1
in 1
the 1
week 1
From 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
I 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
assistant 1
having 1
come 1
for 1
half 1
wages 1
it 1
was 1
obvious 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
some 1
strong 1
motive 1
for 1
securing 1
the 1
situation 1
But 1
how 1
could 1
you 1
guess 1
what 1
the 1
motive 1
was 1
Had 1
there 1
been 1
women 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
suspected 1
a 1
mere 1
vulgar 1
intrigue 1
That 1
however 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
question 1
The 1
man 1
s 1
business 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
one 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
in 1
his 1
house 1
which 1
could 1
account 1
for 1
such 1
elaborate 1
preparations 1
and 1
such 1
an 1
expenditure 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
at 1
It 1
must 1
then 1
be 1
something 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
What 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
assistant 1
s 1
fondness 1
for 1
photography 1
and 1
his 1
trick 1
of 1
vanishing 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
The 1
cellar 1
There 1
was 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
this 1
tangled 1
clue 1
Then 1
I 1
made 1
inquiries 1
as 1
to 1
this 1
mysterious 1
assistant 1
and 1
found 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
deal 1
with 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
coolest 1
and 1
most 1
daring 1
criminals 1
in 1
London 1
He 1
was 1
doing 1
something 1
in 1
the 1
cellar 1
something 1
which 1
took 1
many 1
hours 1
a 1
day 1
for 1
months 1
on 1
end 1
What 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
once 1
more 1
I 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
nothing 1
save 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
running 1
a 1
tunnel 1
to 1
some 1
other 1
building 1
So 1
far 1
I 1
had 1
got 1
when 1
we 1
went 1
to 1
visit 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
action 1
I 1
surprised 1
you 1
by 1
beating 1
upon 1
the 1
pavement 1
with 1
my 1
stick 1
I 1
was 1
ascertaining 1
whether 1
the 1
cellar 1
stretched 1
out 1
in 1
front 1
or 1
behind 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
in 1
front 1
Then 1
I 1
rang 1
the 1
bell 1
and 1
as 1
I 1
hoped 1
the 1
assistant 1
answered 1
it 1
We 1
have 1
had 1
some 1
skirmishes 1
but 1
we 1
had 1
never 1
set 1
eyes 1
upon 1
each 1
other 1
before 1
I 1
hardly 1
looked 1
at 1
his 1
face 1
His 1
knees 1
were 1
what 1
I 1
wished 1
to 1
see 1
You 1
must 1
yourself 1
have 1
remarked 1
how 1
worn 1
wrinkled 1
and 1
stained 1
they 1
were 1
They 1
spoke 1
of 1
those 1
hours 1
of 1
burrowing 1
The 1
only 1
remaining 1
point 1
was 1
what 1
they 1
were 1
burrowing 1
for 1
I 1
walked 1
round 1
the 1
corner 1
saw 1
the 1
City 1
and 1
Suburban 1
Bank 1
abutted 1
on 1
our 1
friend 1
s 1
premises 1
and 1
felt 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
solved 1
my 1
problem 1
When 1
you 1
drove 1
home 1
after 1
the 1
concert 1
I 1
called 1
upon 1
Scotland 1
Yard 1
and 1
upon 1
the 1
chairman 1
of 1
the 1
bank 1
directors 1
with 1
the 1
result 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
seen 1
And 1
how 1
could 1
you 1
tell 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
make 1
their 1
attempt 1
to 1
night 1
I 1
asked 1
Well 1
when 1
they 1
closed 1
their 1
League 1
offices 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
sign 1
that 1
they 1
cared 1
no 1
longer 1
about 1
Mr 1
Jabez 1
Wilson 1
s 1
presence 1
in 1
other 1
words 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
completed 1
their 1
tunnel 1
But 1
it 1
was 1
essential 1
that 1
they 1
should 1
use 1
it 1
soon 1
as 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
discovered 1
or 1
the 1
bullion 1
might 1
be 1
removed 1
Saturday 1
would 1
suit 1
them 1
better 1
than 1
any 1
other 1
day 1
as 1
it 1
would 1
give 1
them 1
two 1
days 1
for 1
their 1
escape 1
For 1
all 1
these 1
reasons 1
I 1
expected 1
them 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
night 1
You 1
reasoned 1
it 1
out 1
beautifully 1
I 1
exclaimed 1
in 1
unfeigned 1
admiration 1
It 1
is 1
so 1
long 1
a 1
chain 1
and 1
yet 1
every 1
link 1
rings 1
true 1
It 1
saved 1
me 1
from 1
ennui 1
he 1
answered 1
yawning 1
Alas 1
I 1
already 1
feel 1
it 1
closing 1
in 1
upon 1
me 1
My 1
life 1
is 1
spent 1
in 1
one 1
long 1
effort 1
to 1
escape 1
from 1
the 1
commonplaces 1
of 1
existence 1
These 1
little 1
problems 1
help 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
And 1
you 1
are 1
a 1
benefactor 1
of 1
the 1
race 1
said 1
I 1
He 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
Well 1
perhaps 1
after 1
all 1
it 1
is 1
of 1
some 1
little 1
use 1
he 1
remarked 1

ADVENTURE 1
III 1
A 1
CASE 1
OF 1
IDENTITY 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
said 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
as 1
we 1
sat 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
in 1
his 1
lodgings 1
at 1
Baker 1
Street 1
life 1
is 1
infinitely 1
stranger 1
than 1
anything 1
which 1
the 1
mind 1
of 1
man 1
could 1
invent 1
We 1
would 1
not 1
dare 1
to 1
conceive 1
the 1
things 1
which 1
are 1
really 1
mere 1
commonplaces 1
of 1
existence 1
If 1
we 1
could 1
fly 1
out 1
of 1
that 1
window 1
hand 1
in 1
hand 1
hover 1
over 1
this 1
great 1
city 1
gently 1
remove 1
the 1
roofs 1
and 1
peep 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
queer 1
things 1
which 1
are 1
going 1
on 1
the 1
strange 1
coincidences 1
the 1
plannings 1
the 1
cross 1
purposes 1
the 1
wonderful 1
chains 1
of 1
events 1
working 1
through 1
generations 1
and 1
leading 1
to 1
the 1
most 1
outre 1
results 1
it 1
would 1
make 1
all 1
fiction 1
with 1
its 1
conventionalities 1
and 1
foreseen 1
conclusions 1
most 1
stale 1
and 1
unprofitable 1
And 1
yet 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
convinced 1
of 1
it 1
I 1
answered 1
The 1
cases 1
which 1
come 1
to 1
light 1
in 1
the 1
papers 1
are 1
as 1
a 1
rule 1
bald 1
enough 1
and 1
vulgar 1
enough 1
We 1
have 1
in 1
our 1
police 1
reports 1
realism 1
pushed 1
to 1
its 1
extreme 1
limits 1
and 1
yet 1
the 1
result 1
is 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
confessed 1
neither 1
fascinating 1
nor 1
artistic 1
A 1
certain 1
selection 1
and 1
discretion 1
must 1
be 1
used 1
in 1
producing 1
a 1
realistic 1
effect 1
remarked 1
Holmes 1
This 1
is 1
wanting 1
in 1
the 1
police 1
report 1
where 1
more 1
stress 1
is 1
laid 1
perhaps 1
upon 1
the 1
platitudes 1
of 1
the 1
magistrate 1
than 1
upon 1
the 1
details 1
which 1
to 1
an 1
observer 1
contain 1
the 1
vital 1
essence 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
matter 1
Depend 1
upon 1
it 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
so 1
unnatural 1
as 1
the 1
commonplace 1
I 1
smiled 1
and 1
shook 1
my 1
head 1
I 1
can 1
quite 1
understand 1
your 1
thinking 1
so 1
I 1
said 1
Of 1
course 1
in 1
your 1
position 1
of 1
unofficial 1
adviser 1
and 1
helper 1
to 1
everybody 1
who 1
is 1
absolutely 1
puzzled 1
throughout 1
three 1
continents 1
you 1
are 1
brought 1
in 1
contact 1
with 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
strange 1
and 1
bizarre 1
But 1
here 1
I 1
picked 1
up 1
the 1
morning 1
paper 1
from 1
the 1
ground 1
let 1
us 1
put 1
it 1
to 1
a 1
practical 1
test 1
Here 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
heading 1
upon 1
which 1
I 1
come 1
A 1
husband 1
s 1
cruelty 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1
There 1
is 1
half 1
a 1
column 1
of 1
print 1
but 1
I 1
know 1
without 1
reading 1
it 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
perfectly 1
familiar 1
to 1
me 1
There 1
is 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
other 1
woman 1
the 1
drink 1
the 1
push 1
the 1
blow 1
the 1
bruise 1
the 1
sympathetic 1
sister 1
or 1
landlady 1
The 1
crudest 1
of 1
writers 1
could 1
invent 1
nothing 1
more 1
crude 1
Indeed 1
your 1
example 1
is 1
an 1
unfortunate 1
one 1
for 1
your 1
argument 1
said 1
Holmes 1
taking 1
the 1
paper 1
and 1
glancing 1
his 1
eye 1
down 1
it 1
This 1
is 1
the 1
Dundas 1
separation 1
case 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
happens 1
I 1
was 1
engaged 1
in 1
clearing 1
up 1
some 1
small 1
points 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
it 1
The 1
husband 1
was 1
a 1
teetotaler 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
other 1
woman 1
and 1
the 1
conduct 1
complained 1
of 1
was 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
drifted 1
into 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
winding 1
up 1
every 1
meal 1
by 1
taking 1
out 1
his 1
false 1
teeth 1
and 1
hurling 1
them 1
at 1
his 1
wife 1
which 1
you 1
will 1
allow 1
is 1
not 1
an 1
action 1
likely 1
to 1
occur 1
to 1
the 1
imagination 1
of 1
the 1
average 1
story 1
teller 1
Take 1
a 1
pinch 1
of 1
snuff 1
Doctor 1
and 1
acknowledge 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
scored 1
over 1
you 1
in 1
your 1
example 1
He 1
held 1
out 1
his 1
snuffbox 1
of 1
old 1
gold 1
with 1
a 1
great 1
amethyst 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
lid 1
Its 1
splendour 1
was 1
in 1
such 1
contrast 1
to 1
his 1
homely 1
ways 1
and 1
simple 1
life 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
commenting 1
upon 1
it 1
Ah 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
forgot 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
seen 1
you 1
for 1
some 1
weeks 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
souvenir 1
from 1
the 1
King 1
of 1
Bohemia 1
in 1
return 1
for 1
my 1
assistance 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
of 1
the 1
Irene 1
Adler 1
papers 1
And 1
the 1
ring 1
I 1
asked 1
glancing 1
at 1
a 1
remarkable 1
brilliant 1
which 1
sparkled 1
upon 1
his 1
finger 1
It 1
was 1
from 1
the 1
reigning 1
family 1
of 1
Holland 1
though 1
the 1
matter 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
served 1
them 1
was 1
of 1
such 1
delicacy 1
that 1
I 1
cannot 1
confide 1
it 1
even 1
to 1
you 1
who 1
have 1
been 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
chronicle 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
of 1
my 1
little 1
problems 1
And 1
have 1
you 1
any 1
on 1
hand 1
just 1
now 1
I 1
asked 1
with 1
interest 1
Some 1
ten 1
or 1
twelve 1
but 1
none 1
which 1
present 1
any 1
feature 1
of 1
interest 1
They 1
are 1
important 1
you 1
understand 1
without 1
being 1
interesting 1
Indeed 1
I 1
have 1
found 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
usually 1
in 1
unimportant 1
matters 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
field 1
for 1
the 1
observation 1
and 1
for 1
the 1
quick 1
analysis 1
of 1
cause 1
and 1
effect 1
which 1
gives 1
the 1
charm 1
to 1
an 1
investigation 1
The 1
larger 1
crimes 1
are 1
apt 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
simpler 1
for 1
the 1
bigger 1
the 1
crime 1
the 1
more 1
obvious 1
as 1
a 1
rule 1
is 1
the 1
motive 1
In 1
these 1
cases 1
save 1
for 1
one 1
rather 1
intricate 1
matter 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
referred 1
to 1
me 1
from 1
Marseilles 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
which 1
presents 1
any 1
features 1
of 1
interest 1
It 1
is 1
possible 1
however 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
have 1
something 1
better 1
before 1
very 1
many 1
minutes 1
are 1
over 1
for 1
this 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
clients 1
or 1
I 1
am 1
much 1
mistaken 1
He 1
had 1
risen 1
from 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
was 1
standing 1
between 1
the 1
parted 1
blinds 1
gazing 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
dull 1
neutral 1
tinted 1
London 1
street 1
Looking 1
over 1
his 1
shoulder 1
I 1
saw 1
that 1
on 1
the 1
pavement 1
opposite 1
there 1
stood 1
a 1
large 1
woman 1
with 1
a 1
heavy 1
fur 1
boa 1
round 1
her 1
neck 1
and 1
a 1
large 1
curling 1
red 1
feather 1
in 1
a 1
broad 1
brimmed 1
hat 1
which 1
was 1
tilted 1
in 1
a 1
coquettish 1
Duchess 1
of 1
Devonshire 1
fashion 1
over 1
her 1
ear 1
From 1
under 1
this 1
great 1
panoply 1
she 1
peeped 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
nervous 1
hesitating 1
fashion 1
at 1
our 1
windows 1
while 1
her 1
body 1
oscillated 1
backward 1
and 1
forward 1
and 1
her 1
fingers 1
fidgeted 1
with 1
her 1
glove 1
buttons 1
Suddenly 1
with 1
a 1
plunge 1
as 1
of 1
the 1
swimmer 1
who 1
leaves 1
the 1
bank 1
she 1
hurried 1
across 1
the 1
road 1
and 1
we 1
heard 1
the 1
sharp 1
clang 1
of 1
the 1
bell 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
those 1
symptoms 1
before 1
said 1
Holmes 1
throwing 1
his 1
cigarette 1
into 1
the 1
fire 1
Oscillation 1
upon 1
the 1
pavement 1
always 1
means 1
an 1
affaire 1
de 1
coeur 1
She 1
would 1
like 1
advice 1
but 1
is 1
not 1
sure 1
that 1
the 1
matter 1
is 1
not 1
too 1
delicate 1
for 1
communication 1
And 1
yet 1
even 1
here 1
we 1
may 1
discriminate 1
When 1
a 1
woman 1
has 1
been 1
seriously 1
wronged 1
by 1
a 1
man 1
she 1
no 1
longer 1
oscillates 1
and 1
the 1
usual 1
symptom 1
is 1
a 1
broken 1
bell 1
wire 1
Here 1
we 1
may 1
take 1
it 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
love 1
matter 1
but 1
that 1
the 1
maiden 1
is 1
not 1
so 1
much 1
angry 1
as 1
perplexed 1
or 1
grieved 1
But 1
here 1
she 1
comes 1
in 1
person 1
to 1
resolve 1
our 1
doubts 1
As 1
he 1
spoke 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
tap 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
the 1
boy 1
in 1
buttons 1
entered 1
to 1
announce 1
Miss 1
Mary 1
Sutherland 1
while 1
the 1
lady 1
herself 1
loomed 1
behind 1
his 1
small 1
black 1
figure 1
like 1
a 1
full 1
sailed 1
merchant 1
man 1
behind 1
a 1
tiny 1
pilot 1
boat 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
welcomed 1
her 1
with 1
the 1
easy 1
courtesy 1
for 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
remarkable 1
and 1
having 1
closed 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
bowed 1
her 1
into 1
an 1
armchair 1
he 1
looked 1
her 1
over 1
in 1
the 1
minute 1
and 1
yet 1
abstracted 1
fashion 1
which 1
was 1
peculiar 1
to 1
him 1
Do 1
you 1
not 1
find 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
with 1
your 1
short 1
sight 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
trying 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
much 1
typewriting 1
I 1
did 1
at 1
first 1
she 1
answered 1
but 1
now 1
I 1
know 1
where 1
the 1
letters 1
are 1
without 1
looking 1
Then 1
suddenly 1
realising 1
the 1
full 1
purport 1
of 1
his 1
words 1
she 1
gave 1
a 1
violent 1
start 1
and 1
looked 1
up 1
with 1
fear 1
and 1
astonishment 1
upon 1
her 1
broad 1
good 1
humoured 1
face 1
You 1
ve 1
heard 1
about 1
me 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
she 1
cried 1
else 1
how 1
could 1
you 1
know 1
all 1
that 1
Never 1
mind 1
said 1
Holmes 1
laughing 1
it 1
is 1
my 1
business 1
to 1
know 1
things 1
Perhaps 1
I 1
have 1
trained 1
myself 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
others 1
overlook 1
If 1
not 1
why 1
should 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
consult 1
me 1
I 1
came 1
to 1
you 1
sir 1
because 1
I 1
heard 1
of 1
you 1
from 1
Mrs 1
Etherege 1
whose 1
husband 1
you 1
found 1
so 1
easy 1
when 1
the 1
police 1
and 1
everyone 1
had 1
given 1
him 1
up 1
for 1
dead 1
Oh 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
I 1
wish 1
you 1
would 1
do 1
as 1
much 1
for 1
me 1
I 1
m 1
not 1
rich 1
but 1
still 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
hundred 1
a 1
year 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
right 1
besides 1
the 1
little 1
that 1
I 1
make 1
by 1
the 1
machine 1
and 1
I 1
would 1
give 1
it 1
all 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
has 1
become 1
of 1
Mr 1
Hosmer 1
Angel 1
Why 1
did 1
you 1
come 1
away 1
to 1
consult 1
me 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
hurry 1
asked 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
with 1
his 1
finger 1
tips 1
together 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
to 1
the 1
ceiling 1
Again 1
a 1
startled 1
look 1
came 1
over 1
the 1
somewhat 1
vacuous 1
face 1
of 1
Miss 1
Mary 1
Sutherland 1
Yes 1
I 1
did 1
bang 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
she 1
said 1
for 1
it 1
made 1
me 1
angry 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
easy 1
way 1
in 1
which 1
Mr 1
Windibank 1
that 1
is 1
my 1
father 1
took 1
it 1
all 1
He 1
would 1
not 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
police 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
go 1
to 1
you 1
and 1
so 1
at 1
last 1
as 1
he 1
would 1
do 1
nothing 1
and 1
kept 1
on 1
saying 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
harm 1
done 1
it 1
made 1
me 1
mad 1
and 1
I 1
just 1
on 1
with 1
my 1
things 1
and 1
came 1
right 1
away 1
to 1
you 1
Your 1
father 1
said 1
Holmes 1
your 1
stepfather 1
surely 1
since 1
the 1
name 1
is 1
different 1
Yes 1
my 1
stepfather 1
I 1
call 1
him 1
father 1
though 1
it 1
sounds 1
funny 1
too 1
for 1
he 1
is 1
only 1
five 1
years 1
and 1
two 1
months 1
older 1
than 1
myself 1
And 1
your 1
mother 1
is 1
alive 1
Oh 1
yes 1
mother 1
is 1
alive 1
and 1
well 1
I 1
wasn 1
t 1
best 1
pleased 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
when 1
she 1
married 1
again 1
so 1
soon 1
after 1
father 1
s 1
death 1
and 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
nearly 1
fifteen 1
years 1
younger 1
than 1
herself 1
Father 1
was 1
a 1
plumber 1
in 1
the 1
Tottenham 1
Court 1
Road 1
and 1
he 1
left 1
a 1
tidy 1
business 1
behind 1
him 1
which 1
mother 1
carried 1
on 1
with 1
Mr 1
Hardy 1
the 1
foreman 1
but 1
when 1
Mr 1
Windibank 1
came 1
he 1
made 1
her 1
sell 1
the 1
business 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
superior 1
being 1
a 1
traveller 1
in 1
wines 1
They 1
got 1
pounds 1
for 1
the 1
goodwill 1
and 1
interest 1
which 1
wasn 1
t 1
near 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
father 1
could 1
have 1
got 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
alive 1
I 1
had 1
expected 1
to 1
see 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
impatient 1
under 1
this 1
rambling 1
and 1
inconsequential 1
narrative 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
contrary 1
he 1
had 1
listened 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
concentration 1
of 1
attention 1
Your 1
own 1
little 1
income 1
he 1
asked 1
does 1
it 1
come 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
business 1
Oh 1
no 1
sir 1
It 1
is 1
quite 1
separate 1
and 1
was 1
left 1
me 1
by 1
my 1
uncle 1
Ned 1
in 1
Auckland 1
It 1
is 1
in 1
New 1
Zealand 1
stock 1
paying 1
per 1
cent 1
Two 1
thousand 1
five 1
hundred 1
pounds 1
was 1
the 1
amount 1
but 1
I 1
can 1
only 1
touch 1
the 1
interest 1
You 1
interest 1
me 1
extremely 1
said 1
Holmes 1
And 1
since 1
you 1
draw 1
so 1
large 1
a 1
sum 1
as 1
a 1
hundred 1
a 1
year 1
with 1
what 1
you 1
earn 1
into 1
the 1
bargain 1
you 1
no 1
doubt 1
travel 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
indulge 1
yourself 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
I 1
believe 1
that 1
a 1
single 1
lady 1
can 1
get 1
on 1
very 1
nicely 1
upon 1
an 1
income 1
of 1
about 1
pounds 1
I 1
could 1
do 1
with 1
much 1
less 1
than 1
that 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
but 1
you 1
understand 1
that 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
I 1
live 1
at 1
home 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
burden 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
so 1
they 1
have 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
money 1
just 1
while 1
I 1
am 1
staying 1
with 1
them 1
Of 1
course 1
that 1
is 1
only 1
just 1
for 1
the 1
time 1
Mr 1
Windibank 1
draws 1
my 1
interest 1
every 1
quarter 1
and 1
pays 1
it 1
over 1
to 1
mother 1
and 1
I 1
find 1
that 1
I 1
can 1
do 1
pretty 1
well 1
with 1
what 1
I 1
earn 1
at 1
typewriting 1
It 1
brings 1
me 1
twopence 1
a 1
sheet 1
and 1
I 1
can 1
often 1
do 1
from 1
fifteen 1
to 1
twenty 1
sheets 1
in 1
a 1
day 1
You 1
have 1
made 1
your 1
position 1
very 1
clear 1
to 1
me 1
said 1
Holmes 1
This 1
is 1
my 1
friend 1
Dr 1
Watson 1
before 1
whom 1
you 1
can 1
speak 1
as 1
freely 1
as 1
before 1
myself 1
Kindly 1
tell 1
us 1
now 1
all 1
about 1
your 1
connection 1
with 1
Mr 1
Hosmer 1
Angel 1
A 1
flush 1
stole 1
over 1
Miss 1
Sutherland 1
s 1
face 1
and 1
she 1
picked 1
nervously 1
at 1
the 1
fringe 1
of 1
her 1
jacket 1
I 1
met 1
him 1
first 1
at 1
the 1
gasfitters 1
ball 1
she 1
said 1
They 1
used 1
to 1
send 1
father 1
tickets 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
alive 1
and 1
then 1
afterwards 1
they 1
remembered 1
us 1
and 1
sent 1
them 1
to 1
mother 1
Mr 1
Windibank 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
us 1
to 1
go 1
He 1
never 1
did 1
wish 1
us 1
to 1
go 1
anywhere 1
He 1
would 1
get 1
quite 1
mad 1
if 1
I 1
wanted 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
to 1
join 1
a 1
Sunday 1
school 1
treat 1
But 1
this 1
time 1
I 1
was 1
set 1
on 1
going 1
and 1
I 1
would 1
go 1
for 1
what 1
right 1
had 1
he 1
to 1
prevent 1
He 1
said 1
the 1
folk 1
were 1
not 1
fit 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
know 1
when 1
all 1
father 1
s 1
friends 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
there 1
And 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
nothing 1
fit 1
to 1
wear 1
when 1
I 1
had 1
my 1
purple 1
plush 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
never 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
taken 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
drawer 1
At 1
last 1
when 1
nothing 1
else 1
would 1
do 1
he 1
went 1
off 1
to 1
France 1
upon 1
the 1
business 1
of 1
the 1
firm 1
but 1
we 1
went 1
mother 1
and 1
I 1
with 1
Mr 1
Hardy 1
who 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
our 1
foreman 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
there 1
I 1
met 1
Mr 1
Hosmer 1
Angel 1
I 1
suppose 1
said 1
Holmes 1
that 1
when 1
Mr 1
Windibank 1
came 1
back 1
from 1
France 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
annoyed 1
at 1
your 1
having 1
gone 1
to 1
the 1
ball 1
Oh 1
well 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
good 1
about 1
it 1
He 1
laughed 1
I 1
remember 1
and 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
and 1
said 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
use 1
denying 1
anything 1
to 1
a 1
woman 1
for 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
her 1
way 1
I 1
see 1
Then 1
at 1
the 1
gasfitters 1
ball 1
you 1
met 1
as 1
I 1
understand 1
a 1
gentleman 1
called 1
Mr 1
Hosmer 1
Angel 1
Yes 1
sir 1
I 1
met 1
him 1
that 1
night 1
and 1
he 1
called 1
next 1
day 1
to 1
ask 1
if 1
we 1
had 1
got 1
home 1
all 1
safe 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
we 1
met 1
him 1
that 1
is 1
to 1
say 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
I 1
met 1
him 1
twice 1
for 1
walks 1
but 1
after 1
that 1
father 1
came 1
back 1
again 1
and 1
Mr 1
Hosmer 1
Angel 1
could 1
not 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
any 1
more 1
No 1
Well 1
you 1
know 1
father 1
didn 1
t 1
like 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
He 1
wouldn 1
t 1
have 1
any 1
visitors 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
help 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
a 1
woman 1
should 1
be 1
happy 1
in 1
her 1
own 1
family 1
circle 1
But 1
then 1
as 1
I 1
used 1
to 1
say 1
to 1
mother 1
a 1
woman 1
wants 1
her 1
own 1
circle 1
to 1
begin 1
with 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
got 1
mine 1
yet 1
But 1
how 1
about 1
Mr 1
Hosmer 1
Angel 1
Did 1
he 1
make 1
no 1
attempt 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
Well 1
father 1
was 1
going 1
off 1
to 1
France 1
again 1
in 1
a 1
week 1
and 1
Hosmer 1
wrote 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
safer 1
and 1
better 1
not 1
to 1
see 1
each 1
other 1
until 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
We 1
could 1
write 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
and 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
write 1
every 1
day 1
I 1
took 1
the 1
letters 1
in 2
the 1
morning 1
so 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
need 1
for 1
father 1
to 1
know 1
Were 1
you 1
engaged 1
to 1
the 1
gentleman 1
at 1
this 1
time 1
Oh 1
yes 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
We 1
were 1
engaged 1
after 1
the 1
first 1
walk 1
that 1
we 1
took 1
Hosmer 1
Mr 1
Angel 1
was 1
a 1
cashier 1
in 1
an 1
office 1
in 1
Leadenhall 1
Street 1
and 1
What 1
office 1
That 1
s 1
the 1
worst 1
of 1
it 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
Where 1
did 1
he 1
live 1
then 1
He 1
slept 1
on 1
the 1
premises 1
And 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
his 1
address 1
No 1
except 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
Leadenhall 1
Street 1
Where 1
did 1
you 1
address 1
your 1
letters 1
then 1
To 1
the 1
Leadenhall 1
Street 1
Post 1
Office 1
to 1
be 1
left 1
till 1
called 1
for 1
He 1
said 1
that 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
sent 1
to 1
the 1
office 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
chaffed 1
by 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
clerks 1
about 1
having 1
letters 1
from 1
a 1
lady 1
so 1
I 1
offered 1
to 1
typewrite 1
them 1
like 1
he 1
did 1
his 1
but 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
have 1
that 1
for 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
when 1
I 1
wrote 1
them 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
come 1
from 1
me 1
but 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
typewritten 1
he 1
always 1
felt 1
that 1
the 1
machine 1
had 1
come 1
between 1
us 1
That 1
will 1
just 1
show 1
you 1
how 1
fond 1
he 1
was 1
of 1
me 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
things 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
think 1
of 1
It 1
was 1
most 1
suggestive 1
said 1
Holmes 1
It 1
has 1
long 1
been 1
an 1
axiom 1
of 1
mine 1
that 1
the 1
little 1
things 1
are 1
infinitely 1
the 1
most 1
important 1
Can 1
you 1
remember 1
any 1
other 1
little 1
things 1
about 1
Mr 1
Hosmer 1
Angel 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
shy 1
man 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
He 1
would 1
rather 1
walk 1
with 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
than 1
in 1
the 1
daylight 1
for 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
hated 1
to 1
be 1
conspicuous 1
Very 1
retiring 1
and 1
gentlemanly 1
he 1
was 1
Even 1
his 1
voice 1
was 1
gentle 1
He 1
d 1
had 1
the 1
quinsy 1
and 1
swollen 1
glands 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
young 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
and 1
it 1
had 1
left 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
weak 1
throat 1
and 1
a 1
hesitating 1
whispering 1
fashion 1
of 1
speech 1
He 1
was 1
always 1
well 1
dressed 1
very 1
neat 1
and 1
plain 1
but 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
weak 1
just 1
as 1
mine 1
are 1
and 1
he 1
wore 1
tinted 1
glasses 1
against 1
the 1
glare 1
Well 1
and 1
what 1
happened 1
when 1
Mr 1
Windibank 1
your 1
stepfather 1
returned 1
to 1
France 1
Mr 1
Hosmer 1
Angel 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
again 1
and 1
proposed 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
marry 1
before 1
father 1
came 1
back 1
He 1
was 1
in 1
dreadful 1
earnest 1
and 1
made 1
me 1
swear 1
with 1
my 1
hands 1
on 1
the 1
Testament 1
that 1
whatever 1
happened 1
I 1
would 1
always 1
be 1
true 1
to 1
him 1
Mother 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
quite 1
right 1
to 1
make 1
me 1
swear 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
his 1
passion 1
Mother 1
was 1
all 1
in 1
his 1
favour 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
and 1
was 1
even 1
fonder 1
of 1
him 1
than 1
I 1
was 1
Then 1
when 1
they 1
talked 1
of 1
marrying 1
within 1
the 1
week 1
I 1
began 1
to 1
ask 1
about 1
father 1
but 1
they 1
both 1
said 1
never 1
to 1
mind 1
about 1
father 1
but 1
just 1
to 1
tell 1
him 1
afterwards 1
and 1
mother 1
said 1
she 1
would 1
make 1
it 1
all 1
right 1
with 1
him 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
quite 1
like 1
that 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
It 1
seemed 1
funny 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
ask 1
his 1
leave 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
few 1
years 1
older 1
than 1
me 1
but 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
on 1
the 1
sly 1
so 1
I 1
wrote 1
to 1
father 1
at 1
Bordeaux 1
where 1
the 1
company 1
has 1
its 1
French 1
offices 1
but 1
the 1
letter 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
very 1
morning 1
of 1
the 1
wedding 1
It 1
missed 1
him 1
then 1
Yes 1
sir 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
started 1
to 1
England 1
just 1
before 1
it 1
arrived 1
Ha 1
that 1
was 1
unfortunate 1
Your 1
wedding 1
was 1
arranged 1
then 1
for 1
the 1
Friday 1
Was 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
church 1
Yes 1
sir 1
but 1
very 1
quietly 1
It 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
St 1
Saviour 1
s 1
near 1
King 1
s 1
Cross 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
to 1
have 1
breakfast 1
afterwards 1
at 1
the 1
St 1
Pancras 1
Hotel 1
Hosmer 1
came 1
for 1
us 1
in 1
a 1
hansom 1
but 1
as 1
there 1
were 1
two 1
of 1
us 1
he 1
put 1
us 1
both 1
into 1
it 1
and 1
stepped 1
himself 1
into 1
a 1
four 1
wheeler 1
which 1
happened 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
only 1
other 1
cab 1
in 1
the 1
street 1
We 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
church 1
first 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
four 1
wheeler 1
drove 1
up 1
we 1
waited 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
step 1
out 1
but 1
he 1
never 1
did 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
cabman 1
got 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
box 1
and 1
looked 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
one 1
there 1
The 1
cabman 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
imagine 1
what 1
had 1
become 1
of 1
him 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
him 1
get 1
in 1
with 1
his 1
own 1
eyes 1
That 1
was 1
last 1
Friday 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
never 1
seen 1
or 1
heard 1
anything 1
since 1
then 1
to 1
throw 1
any 1
light 1
upon 1
what 1
became 1
of 1
him 1
It 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
very 1
shamefully 1
treated 1
said 1
Holmes 1
Oh 1
no 1
sir 1
He 1
was 1
too 1
good 1
and 1
kind 1
to 1
leave 1
me 1
so 1
Why 1
all 1
the 1
morning 1
he 1
was 1
saying 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
whatever 1
happened 1
I 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
true 1
and 1
that 1
even 1
if 1
something 1
quite 1
unforeseen 1
occurred 1
to 1
separate 1
us 1
I 1
was 1
always 1
to 1
remember 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
pledged 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
claim 1
his 1
pledge 1
sooner 1
or 1
later 1
It 1
seemed 1
strange 1
talk 1
for 1
a 1
wedding 1
morning 1
but 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
since 1
gives 1
a 1
meaning 1
to 1
it 1
Most 1
certainly 1
it 1
does 1
Your 1
own 1
opinion 1
is 1
then 1
that 1
some 1
unforeseen 1
catastrophe 1
has 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
Yes 1
sir 1
I 1
believe 1
that 1
he 1
foresaw 1
some 1
danger 1
or 1
else 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
talked 1
so 1
And 1
then 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
what 1
he 1
foresaw 1
happened 1
But 1
you 1
have 1
no 1
notion 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
it 1
could 1
have 1
been 1
None 1
One 1
more 1
question 1
How 1
did 1
your 1
mother 1
take 1
the 1
matter 1
She 1
was 1
angry 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
never 1
to 1
speak 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
again 1
And 1
your 1
father 1
Did 1
you 1
tell 1
him 1
Yes 1
and 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
think 1
with 1
me 1
that 1
something 1
had 1
happened 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
hear 1
of 1
Hosmer 1
again 1
As 1
he 1
said 1
what 1
interest 1
could 1
anyone 1
have 1
in 1
bringing 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
doors 1
of 1
the 1
church 1
and 1
then 1
leaving 1
me 1
Now 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
borrowed 1
my 1
money 1
or 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
married 1
me 1
and 1
got 1
my 1
money 1
settled 1
on 1
him 1
there 1
might 1
be 1
some 1
reason 1
but 1
Hosmer 1
was 1
very 1
independent 1
about 1
money 1
and 1
never 1
would 1
look 1
at 1
a 1
shilling 1
of 1
mine 1
And 1
yet 1
what 1
could 1
have 1
happened 1
And 1
why 1
could 1
he 1
not 1
write 1
Oh 1
it 1
drives 1
me 1
half 1
mad 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
sleep 1
a 1
wink 1
at 1
night 1
She 1
pulled 1
a 1
little 1
handkerchief 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
muff 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
sob 1
heavily 1
into 1
it 1
I 1
shall 1
glance 1
into 1
the 1
case 1
for 1
you 1
said 1
Holmes 1
rising 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
we 1
shall 1
reach 1
some 1
definite 1
result 1
Let 1
the 1
weight 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
rest 1
upon 1
me 1
now 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
let 1
your 1
mind 1
dwell 1
upon 1
it 1
further 1
Above 1
all 1
try 1
to 1
let 1
Mr 1
Hosmer 1
Angel 1
vanish 1
from 1
your 1
memory 1
as 1
he 1
has 1
done 1
from 1
your 1
life 1
Then 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
I 1
ll 1
see 1
him 1
again 1
I 1
fear 1
not 1
Then 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
to 1
him 1
You 1
will 1
leave 1
that 1
question 1
in 1
my 1
hands 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
an 1
accurate 1
description 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
any 1
letters 1
of 1
his 1
which 1
you 1
can 1
spare 1
I 1
advertised 1
for 1
him 1
in 1
last 1
Saturday 1
s 1
Chronicle 1
said 1
she 1
Here 1
is 1
the 1
slip 1
and 1
here 1
are 1
four 1
letters 1
from 1
him 1
Thank 1
you 1
And 1
your 1
address 1
No 1
Lyon 1
Place 1
Camberwell 1
Mr 1
Angel 1
s 1
address 1
you 1
never 1
had 1
I 1
understand 1
Where 1
is 1
your 1
father 1
s 1
place 1
of 1
business 1
He 1
travels 1
for 1
Westhouse 1
Marbank 1
the 1
great 1
claret 1
importers 1
of 1
Fenchurch 1
Street 1
Thank 1
you 1
You 1
have 1
made 1
your 1
statement 1
very 1
clearly 1
You 1
will 1
leave 1
the 1
papers 1
here 1
and 1
remember 1
the 1
advice 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
given 1
you 1
Let 1
the 1
whole 1
incident 1
be 1
a 1
sealed 1
book 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
allow 1
it 1
to 1
affect 1
your 1
life 1
You 1
are 1
very 1
kind 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
but 1
I 1
cannot 1
do 1
that 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
true 1
to 1
Hosmer 1
He 1
shall 1
find 1
me 1
ready 1
when 1
he 1
comes 1
back 1
For 1
all 1
the 1
preposterous 1
hat 1
and 1
the 1
vacuous 1
face 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
noble 1
in 1
the 1
simple 1
faith 1
of 1
our 1
visitor 1
which 1
compelled 1
our 1
respect 1
She 1
laid 1
her 1
little 1
bundle 1
of 1
papers 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
went 1
her 1
way 1
with 1
a 1
promise 1
to 1
come 1
again 1
whenever 1
she 1
might 1
be 1
summoned 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
sat 1
silent 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
with 1
his 1
fingertips 1
still 1
pressed 1
together 1
his 1
legs 1
stretched 1
out 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
his 1
gaze 1
directed 1
upward 1
to 1
the 1
ceiling 1
Then 1
he 1
took 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
rack 1
the 1
old 1
and 1
oily 1
clay 1
pipe 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
him 1
as 1
a 1
counsellor 1
and 1
having 1
lit 1
it 1
he 1
leaned 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
with 1
the 1
thick 1
blue 1
cloud 1
wreaths 1
spinning 1
up 1
from 1
him 1
and 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
infinite 1
languor 1
in 1
his 1
face 1
Quite 1
an 1
interesting 1
study 1
that 1
maiden 1
he 1
observed 1
I 1
found 1
her 1
more 1
interesting 1
than 1
her 1
little 1
problem 1
which 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
is 1
rather 1
a 1
trite 1
one 1
You 1
will 1
find 1
parallel 1
cases 1
if 1
you 1
consult 1
my 1
index 1
in 1
Andover 1
in 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
at 1
The 1
Hague 1
last 1
year 1
Old 1
as 1
is 1
the 1
idea 1
however 1
there 1
were 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
details 1
which 1
were 1
new 1
to 1
me 1
But 1
the 1
maiden 1
herself 1
was 1
most 1
instructive 1
You 1
appeared 1
to 1
read 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
upon 1
her 1
which 1
was 1
quite 1
invisible 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
remarked 1
Not 1
invisible 1
but 1
unnoticed 1
Watson 1
You 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
where 1
to 1
look 1
and 1
so 1
you 1
missed 1
all 1
that 1
was 1
important 1
I 1
can 1
never 1
bring 1
you 1
to 1
realise 1
the 1
importance 1
of 1
sleeves 1
the 1
suggestiveness 1
of 1
thumb 1
nails 1
or 1
the 1
great 1
issues 1
that 1
may 1
hang 1
from 1
a 1
boot 1
lace 1
Now 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
gather 1
from 1
that 1
woman 1
s 1
appearance 1
Describe 1
it 1
Well 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
slate 1
coloured 1
broad 1
brimmed 1
straw 1
hat 1
with 1
a 1
feather 1
of 1
a 1
brickish 1
red 1
Her 1
jacket 1
was 1
black 1
with 1
black 1
beads 1
sewn 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
a 1
fringe 1
of 1
little 1
black 1
jet 1
ornaments 1
Her 1
dress 1
was 1
brown 1
rather 1
darker 1
than 1
coffee 1
colour 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
purple 1
plush 1
at 1
the 1
neck 1
and 1
sleeves 1
Her 1
gloves 1
were 1
greyish 1
and 1
were 1
worn 1
through 1
at 1
the 1
right 1
forefinger 1
Her 1
boots 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
observe 1
She 1
had 1
small 1
round 1
hanging 1
gold 1
earrings 1
and 1
a 1
general 1
air 1
of 1
being 1
fairly 1
well 1
to 1
do 1
in 1
a 1
vulgar 1
comfortable 1
easy 1
going 1
way 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
clapped 1
his 1
hands 1
softly 1
together 1
and 1
chuckled 1
Pon 1
my 1
word 1
Watson 1
you 1
are 1
coming 1
along 1
wonderfully 1
You 1
have 1
really 1
done 1
very 1
well 1
indeed 1
It 1
is 1
true 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
missed 1
everything 1
of 1
importance 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
hit 1
upon 1
the 1
method 1
and 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
quick 1
eye 1
for 1
colour 1
Never 1
trust 1
to 1
general 1
impressions 1
my 1
boy 1
but 1
concentrate 1
yourself 1
upon 1
details 1
My 1
first 1
glance 1
is 1
always 1
at 1
a 1
woman 1
s 1
sleeve 1
In 1
a 1
man 1
it 1
is 1
perhaps 1
better 1
first 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
knee 1
of 1
the 1
trouser 1
As 1
you 1
observe 1
this 1
woman 1
had 1
plush 1
upon 1
her 1
sleeves 1
which 1
is 1
a 1
most 1
useful 1
material 1
for 1
showing 1
traces 1
The 1
double 1
line 1
a 1
little 1
above 1
the 1
wrist 1
where 1
the 1
typewritist 1
presses 1
against 1
the 1
table 1
was 1
beautifully 1
defined 1
The 1
sewing 1
machine 1
of 1
the 1
hand 1
type 1
leaves 1
a 1
similar 1
mark 1
but 1
only 1
on 1
the 1
left 1
arm 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
it 1
farthest 1
from 1
the 1
thumb 1
instead 1
of 1
being 1
right 1
across 1
the 1
broadest 1
part 1
as 1
this 1
was 1
I 1
then 1
glanced 1
at 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
observing 1
the 1
dint 1
of 1
a 1
pince 1
nez 1
at 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
her 1
nose 1
I 1
ventured 1
a 1
remark 1
upon 1
short 1
sight 1
and 1
typewriting 1
which 1
seemed 1
to 1
surprise 1
her 1
It 1
surprised 1
me 1
But 1
surely 1
it 1
was 1
obvious 1
I 1
was 1
then 1
much 1
surprised 1
and 1
interested 1
on 1
glancing 1
down 1
to 1
observe 1
that 1
though 1
the 1
boots 1
which 1
she 1
was 1
wearing 1
were 1
not 1
unlike 1
each 1
other 1
they 1
were 1
really 1
odd 1
ones 1
the 1
one 1
having 1
a 1
slightly 1
decorated 1
toe 1
cap 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
a 1
plain 1
one 1
One 1
was 1
buttoned 1
only 1
in 1
the 1
two 1
lower 1
buttons 1
out 1
of 1
five 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
at 1
the 1
first 1
third 1
and 1
fifth 1
Now 1
when 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
otherwise 1
neatly 1
dressed 1
has 1
come 1
away 1
from 1
home 1
with 1
odd 1
boots 1
half 1
buttoned 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
great 1
deduction 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
she 1
came 1
away 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
And 1
what 1
else 1
I 1
asked 1
keenly 1
interested 1
as 1
I 1
always 1
was 1
by 1
my 1
friend 1
s 1
incisive 1
reasoning 1
I 1
noted 1
in 1
passing 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
written 1
a 1
note 1
before 1
leaving 1
home 1
but 1
after 1
being 1
fully 1
dressed 1
You 1
observed 1
that 1
her 1
right 1
glove 1
was 1
torn 1
at 1
the 1
forefinger 1
but 1
you 1
did 1
not 1
apparently 1
see 1
that 1
both 1
glove 1
and 1
finger 1
were 1
stained 1
with 1
violet 1
ink 1
She 1
had 1
written 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
and 1
dipped 1
her 1
pen 1
too 1
deep 1
It 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
this 1
morning 1
or 1
the 1
mark 1
would 1
not 1
remain 1
clear 1
upon 1
the 1
finger 1
All 1
this 1
is 1
amusing 1
though 1
rather 1
elementary 1
but 1
I 1
must 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
business 1
Watson 1
Would 1
you 1
mind 1
reading 1
me 1
the 1
advertised 1
description 1
of 1
Mr 1
Hosmer 1
Angel 1
I 1
held 1
the 1
little 1
printed 1
slip 1
to 1
the 1
light 1
Missing 1
it 1
said 1
on 1
the 1
morning 1
of 1
the 1
fourteenth 1
a 1
gentleman 1
named 1
Hosmer 1
Angel 1
About 1
five 1
ft 1
seven 1
in 2
height 1
strongly 1
built 1
sallow 1
complexion 1
black 1
hair 1
a 1
little 1
bald 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
bushy 1
black 1
side 1
whiskers 1
and 1
moustache 1
tinted 1
glasses 1
slight 1
infirmity 1
of 1
speech 1
Was 1
dressed 1
when 1
last 1
seen 1
in 1
black 1
frock 1
coat 1
faced 1
with 1
silk 1
black 1
waistcoat 1
gold 1
Albert 1
chain 1
and 1
grey 1
Harris 1
tweed 1
trousers 1
with 1
brown 1
gaiters 1
over 1
elastic 1
sided 1
boots 1
Known 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
employed 1
in 1
an 1
office 1
in 1
Leadenhall 1
Street 1
Anybody 1
bringing 1
That 1
will 1
do 1
said 1
Holmes 1
As 1
to 1
the 1
letters 1
he 1
continued 1
glancing 1
over 1
them 1
they 1
are 1
very 1
commonplace 1
Absolutely 1
no 1
clue 1
in 1
them 1
to 1
Mr 1
Angel 1
save 1
that 1
he 1
quotes 1
Balzac 1
once 1
There 1
is 1
one 1
remarkable 1
point 1
however 1
which 1
will 1
no 1
doubt 1
strike 1
you 1
They 1
are 1
typewritten 1
I 1
remarked 1
Not 1
only 1
that 1
but 1
the 1
signature 1
is 1
typewritten 1
Look 1
at 1
the 1
neat 1
little 1
Hosmer 1
Angel 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
date 1
you 1
see 1
but 1
no 1
superscription 1
except 1
Leadenhall 1
Street 1
which 1
is 1
rather 1
vague 1
The 1
point 1
about 1
the 1
signature 1
is 1
very 1
suggestive 1
in 1
fact 1
we 1
may 1
call 1
it 1
conclusive 1
Of 1
what 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
is 1
it 1
possible 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
see 1
how 1
strongly 1
it 1
bears 1
upon 1
the 1
case 1
I 1
cannot 1
say 1
that 1
I 1
do 1
unless 1
it 1
were 1
that 1
he 1
wished 1
to 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
deny 1
his 1
signature 1
if 1
an 1
action 1
for 1
breach 1
of 1
promise 1
were 1
instituted 1
No 1
that 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
point 1
However 1
I 1
shall 1
write 1
two 1
letters 1
which 1
should 1
settle 1
the 1
matter 1
One 1
is 1
to 1
a 1
firm 1
in 1
the 1
City 1
the 1
other 1
is 1
to 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
s 1
stepfather 1
Mr 1
Windibank 1
asking 1
him 1
whether 1
he 1
could 1
meet 1
us 1
here 1
at 1
six 1
o 1
clock 1
tomorrow 1
evening 1
It 1
is 1
just 1
as 1
well 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
do 1
business 1
with 1
the 1
male 1
relatives 1
And 1
now 1
Doctor 1
we 1
can 1
do 1
nothing 1
until 1
the 1
answers 1
to 1
those 1
letters 1
come 1
so 1
we 1
may 1
put 1
our 1
little 1
problem 1
upon 1
the 1
shelf 1
for 1
the 1
interim 1
I 1
had 2
so 1
many 1
reasons 1
to 1
believe 1
in 1
my 1
friend 1
s 1
subtle 1
powers 1
of 1
reasoning 1
and 1
extraordinary 1
energy 1
in 1
action 1
that 1
I 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
some 1
solid 1
grounds 1
for 1
the 1
assured 1
and 1
easy 1
demeanour 1
with 1
which 1
he 1
treated 1
the 1
singular 1
mystery 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
called 1
upon 1
to 1
fathom 1
Once 1
only 1
had 1
I 1
known 1
him 1
to 1
fail 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
of 1
the 1
King 1
of 1
Bohemia 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
Irene 1
Adler 1
photograph 1
but 1
when 1
I 1
looked 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
weird 1
business 1
of 1
the 1
Sign 1
of 1
Four 1
and 1
the 1
extraordinary 1
circumstances 1
connected 1
with 1
the 1
Study 1
in 1
Scarlet 1
I 1
felt 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
strange 1
tangle 1
indeed 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
unravel 1
I 1
left 1
him 1
then 1
still 1
puffing 1
at 1
his 1
black 1
clay 1
pipe 1
with 1
the 1
conviction 1
that 1
when 1
I 1
came 1
again 1
on 1
the 1
next 1
evening 1
I 1
would 1
find 1
that 1
he 1
held 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
all 1
the 1
clues 1
which 1
would 1
lead 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
identity 1
of 1
the 1
disappearing 1
bridegroom 1
of 1
Miss 1
Mary 1
Sutherland 1
A 1
professional 1
case 1
of 1
great 1
gravity 1
was 1
engaging 1
my 1
own 1
attention 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
next 1
day 1
I 1
was 1
busy 1
at 1
the 1
bedside 1
of 1
the 1
sufferer 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
until 1
close 1
upon 1
six 1
o 1
clock 1
that 1
I 1
found 1
myself 1
free 1
and 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
spring 1
into 1
a 1
hansom 1
and 1
drive 1
to 1
Baker 1
Street 1
half 1
afraid 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
be 1
too 1
late 1
to 1
assist 1
at 1
the 1
denouement 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
mystery 1
I 1
found 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
alone 1
however 1
half 1
asleep 1
with 1
his 1
long 1
thin 1
form 1
curled 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
recesses 1
of 1
his 1
armchair 1
A 1
formidable 1
array 1
of 1
bottles 1
and 1
test 1
tubes 1
with 1
the 1
pungent 1
cleanly 1
smell 1
of 1
hydrochloric 1
acid 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
spent 1
his 1
day 1
in 1
the 1
chemical 1
work 1
which 1
was 1
so 1
dear 1
to 1
him 1
Well 1
have 1
you 1
solved 1
it 1
I 1
asked 1
as 1
I 1
entered 1
Yes 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
bisulphate 1
of 1
baryta 1
No 1
no 1
the 1
mystery 1
I 1
cried 1
Oh 1
that 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
salt 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
working 1
upon 1
There 1
was 1
never 1
any 1
mystery 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
though 1
as 1
I 1
said 1
yesterday 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
details 1
are 1
of 1
interest 1
The 1
only 1
drawback 1
is 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
law 1
I 1
fear 1
that 1
can 1
touch 1
the 1
scoundrel 1
Who 1
was 1
he 1
then 1
and 1
what 1
was 1
his 1
object 1
in 1
deserting 1
Miss 1
Sutherland 1
The 1
question 1
was 1
hardly 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
mouth 1
and 1
Holmes 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
opened 1
his 1
lips 1
to 1
reply 1
when 1
we 1
heard 1
a 1
heavy 1
footfall 1
in 1
the 1
passage 1
and 1
a 1
tap 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
This 1
is 1
the 1
girl 1
s 1
stepfather 1
Mr 1
James 1
Windibank 1
said 1
Holmes 1
He 1
has 1
written 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
here 1
at 1
six 1
Come 1
in 1
The 1
man 1
who 1
entered 1
was 1
a 1
sturdy 1
middle 1
sized 1
fellow 1
some 1
thirty 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
clean 1
shaven 1
and 1
sallow 1
skinned 1
with 1
a 1
bland 1
insinuating 1
manner 1
and 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
wonderfully 1
sharp 1
and 1
penetrating 1
grey 1
eyes 1
He 1
shot 1
a 1
questioning 1
glance 1
at 1
each 1
of 1
us 1
placed 1
his 1
shiny 1
top 1
hat 1
upon 1
the 1
sideboard 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
slight 1
bow 1
sidled 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
nearest 1
chair 1
Good 1
evening 1
Mr 1
James 1
Windibank 1
said 1
Holmes 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
this 1
typewritten 1
letter 1
is 1
from 1
you 1
in 1
which 1
you 1
made 1
an 1
appointment 1
with 1
me 1
for 1
six 1
o 1
clock 1
Yes 1
sir 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
little 1
late 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
quite 1
my 1
own 1
master 1
you 1
know 1
I 1
am 1
sorry 1
that 1
Miss 1
Sutherland 1
has 1
troubled 1
you 1
about 1
this 1
little 1
matter 1
for 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
far 1
better 1
not 1
to 1
wash 1
linen 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
in 1
public 1
It 1
was 1
quite 1
against 1
my 1
wishes 1
that 1
she 1
came 1
but 1
she 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
excitable 1
impulsive 1
girl 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
noticed 1
and 1
she 1
is 1
not 1
easily 1
controlled 1
when 1
she 1
has 1
made 1
up 1
her 1
mind 1
on 1
a 1
point 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
mind 1
you 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
connected 1
with 1
the 1
official 1
police 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
pleasant 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
family 1
misfortune 1
like 1
this 1
noised 1
abroad 1
Besides 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
useless 1
expense 1
for 1
how 1
could 1
you 1
possibly 1
find 1
this 1
Hosmer 1
Angel 1
On 1
the 1
contrary 1
said 1
Holmes 1
quietly 1
I 1
have 1
every 1
reason 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
I 1
will 1
succeed 1
in 1
discovering 1
Mr 1
Hosmer 1
Angel 1
Mr 1
Windibank 1
gave 1
a 1
violent 1
start 1
and 1
dropped 1
his 1
gloves 1
I 1
am 1
delighted 1
to 1
hear 1
it 1
he 1
said 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
curious 1
thing 1
remarked 1
Holmes 1
that 1
a 1
typewriter 1
has 1
really 1
quite 1
as 1
much 1
individuality 1
as 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
handwriting 1
Unless 1
they 1
are 1
quite 1
new 1
no 1
two 1
of 1
them 1
write 1
exactly 1
alike 1
Some 1
letters 1
get 1
more 1
worn 1
than 1
others 1
and 1
some 1
wear 1
only 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
Now 1
you 1
remark 1
in 1
this 1
note 1
of 1
yours 1
Mr 1
Windibank 1
that 1
in 1
every 1
case 1
there 1
is 1
some 1
little 1
slurring 1
over 1
of 1
the 1
e 1
and 1
a 1
slight 1
defect 1
in 1
the 1
tail 1
of 1
the 1
r 1
There 1
are 1
fourteen 1
other 1
characteristics 1
but 1
those 1
are 1
the 1
more 1
obvious 1
We 1
do 1
all 1
our 1
correspondence 1
with 1
this 1
machine 1
at 1
the 1
office 1
and 1
no 1
doubt 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
worn 1
our 1
visitor 1
answered 1
glancing 1
keenly 1
at 1
Holmes 1
with 1
his 1
bright 1
little 1
eyes 1
And 1
now 1
I 1
will 1
show 1
you 1
what 1
is 1
really 1
a 1
very 1
interesting 1
study 1
Mr 1
Windibank 1
Holmes 1
continued 1
I 1
think 1
of 1
writing 1
another 1
little 1
monograph 1
some 1
of 1
these 1
days 1
on 1
the 1
typewriter 1
and 1
its 1
relation 1
to 1
crime 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
subject 1
to 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
devoted 1
some 1
little 1
attention 1
I 1
have 1
here 1
four 1
letters 1
which 1
purport 1
to 1
come 1
from 1
the 1
missing 1
man 1
They 1
are 1
all 1
typewritten 1
In 1
each 1
case 1
not 1
only 1
are 1
the 1
e 1
s 1
slurred 1
and 1
the 1
r 1
s 1
tailless 1
but 1
you 1
will 1
observe 1
if 1
you 1
care 1
to 1
use 1
my 1
magnifying 1
lens 1
that 1
the 1
fourteen 1
other 1
characteristics 1
to 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
alluded 1
are 1
there 1
as 1
well 1
Mr 1
Windibank 1
sprang 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
picked 1
up 1
his 1
hat 1
I 1
cannot 1
waste 1
time 1
over 1
this 1
sort 1
of 1
fantastic 1
talk 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
he 1
said 1
If 1
you 1
can 1
catch 1
the 1
man 1
catch 1
him 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
know 1
when 1
you 1
have 1
done 1
it 1
Certainly 1
said 1
Holmes 1
stepping 1
over 1
and 1
turning 1
the 1
key 1
in 1
the 1
door 1
I 1
let 1
you 1
know 1
then 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
caught 1
him 1
What 1
where 1
shouted 1
Mr 1
Windibank 1
turning 1
white 1
to 1
his 1
lips 1
and 1
glancing 1
about 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
rat 1
in 1
a 1
trap 1
Oh 1
it 1
won 1
t 1
do 1
really 1
it 1
won 1
t 1
said 1
Holmes 1
suavely 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
possible 1
getting 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
Mr 1
Windibank 1
It 1
is 1
quite 1
too 1
transparent 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
bad 1
compliment 1
when 1
you 1
said 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
solve 1
so 1
simple 1
a 1
question 1
That 1
s 1
right 1
Sit 1
down 1
and 1
let 1
us 1
talk 1
it 1
over 1
Our 1
visitor 1
collapsed 1
into 1
a 1
chair 1
with 1
a 1
ghastly 1
face 1
and 1
a 1
glitter 1
of 1
moisture 1
on 1
his 1
brow 1
It 1
it 1
s 1
not 1
actionable 1
he 1
stammered 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
much 1
afraid 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
But 1
between 1
ourselves 1
Windibank 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
cruel 1
and 1
selfish 1
and 1
heartless 1
a 1
trick 1
in 1
a 1
petty 1
way 1
as 1
ever 1
came 1
before 1
me 1
Now 1
let 1
me 1
just 1
run 1
over 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
events 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
contradict 1
me 1
if 1
I 1
go 1
wrong 1
The 1
man 1
sat 1
huddled 1
up 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
sunk 1
upon 1
his 1
breast 1
like 1
one 1
who 1
is 1
utterly 1
crushed 1
Holmes 1
stuck 1
his 1
feet 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
mantelpiece 1
and 1
leaning 1
back 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
in 1
his 1
pockets 1
began 1
talking 1
rather 1
to 1
himself 1
as 1
it 1
seemed 1
than 1
to 1
us 1
The 1
man 1
married 1
a 1
woman 1
very 1
much 1
older 1
than 1
himself 1
for 1
her 1
money 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
he 1
enjoyed 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
money 1
of 1
the 1
daughter 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
she 1
lived 1
with 1
them 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
considerable 1
sum 1
for 1
people 1
in 1
their 1
position 1
and 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
made 1
a 1
serious 1
difference 1
It 1
was 1
worth 1
an 1
effort 1
to 1
preserve 1
it 1
The 1
daughter 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
good 1
amiable 1
disposition 1
but 1
affectionate 1
and 1
warm 1
hearted 1
in 1
her 1
ways 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
evident 1
that 1
with 1
her 1
fair 1
personal 1
advantages 1
and 1
her 1
little 1
income 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
remain 1
single 1
long 1
Now 1
her 1
marriage 1
would 1
mean 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
a 1
hundred 1
a 1
year 1
so 1
what 1
does 1
her 1
stepfather 1
do 1
to 1
prevent 1
it 1
He 1
takes 1
the 1
obvious 1
course 1
of 1
keeping 1
her 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
forbidding 1
her 1
to 1
seek 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
people 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
age 1
But 1
soon 1
he 1
found 1
that 2
would 1
not 1
answer 1
forever 1
She 1
became 1
restive 1
insisted 1
upon 1
her 1
rights 1
and 1
finally 1
announced 1
her 1
positive 1
intention 1
of 1
going 1
to 1
a 1
certain 1
ball 1
What 1
does 1
her 1
clever 1
stepfather 1
do 1
then 1
He 1
conceives 1
an 1
idea 1
more 1
creditable 1
to 1
his 1
head 1
than 1
to 1
his 1
heart 1
With 1
the 1
connivance 1
and 1
assistance 1
of 1
his 1
wife 1
he 1
disguised 1
himself 1
covered 1
those 1
keen 1
eyes 1
with 1
tinted 1
glasses 1
masked 1
the 1
face 1
with 1
a 1
moustache 1
and 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
bushy 1
whiskers 1
sunk 1
that 1
clear 1
voice 1
into 1
an 1
insinuating 1
whisper 1
and 1
doubly 1
secure 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
girl 1
s 1
short 1
sight 1
he 1
appears 1
as 1
Mr 1
Hosmer 1
Angel 1
and 1
keeps 1
off 1
other 1
lovers 1
by 1
making 1
love 1
himself 1
It 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
joke 1
at 1
first 1
groaned 1
our 1
visitor 1
We 1
never 1
thought 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
carried 1
away 1
Very 1
likely 1
not 1
However 1
that 1
may 1
be 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
was 1
very 1
decidedly 1
carried 1
away 1
and 1
having 1
quite 1
made 1
up 1
her 1
mind 1
that 1
her 1
stepfather 1
was 1
in 1
France 1
the 1
suspicion 1
of 1
treachery 1
never 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
entered 1
her 1
mind 1
She 1
was 1
flattered 1
by 1
the 1
gentleman 1
s 1
attentions 1
and 1
the 1
effect 1
was 1
increased 1
by 1
the 1
loudly 1
expressed 1
admiration 1
of 1
her 1
mother 1
Then 1
Mr 1
Angel 1
began 1
to 1
call 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
obvious 1
that 1
the 1
matter 1
should 1
be 1
pushed 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
it 1
would 1
go 1
if 1
a 1
real 1
effect 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
produced 1
There 1
were 1
meetings 1
and 1
an 1
engagement 1
which 1
would 1
finally 1
secure 1
the 1
girl 1
s 1
affections 1
from 1
turning 1
towards 1
anyone 1
else 1
But 1
the 1
deception 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
kept 1
up 1
forever 1
These 1
pretended 1
journeys 1
to 1
France 1
were 1
rather 1
cumbrous 1
The 1
thing 1
to 1
do 1
was 1
clearly 1
to 1
bring 1
the 1
business 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
dramatic 1
manner 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
leave 1
a 1
permanent 1
impression 1
upon 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
s 1
mind 1
and 1
prevent 1
her 1
from 1
looking 1
upon 1
any 1
other 1
suitor 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
to 1
come 1
Hence 1
those 1
vows 1
of 1
fidelity 1
exacted 1
upon 1
a 1
Testament 1
and 1
hence 1
also 1
the 1
allusions 1
to 1
a 1
possibility 1
of 1
something 1
happening 1
on 1
the 1
very 1
morning 1
of 1
the 1
wedding 1
James 1
Windibank 1
wished 1
Miss 1
Sutherland 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
bound 1
to 1
Hosmer 1
Angel 1
and 1
so 1
uncertain 1
as 1
to 1
his 1
fate 1
that 1
for 1
ten 1
years 1
to 1
come 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
listen 1
to 1
another 1
man 1
As 1
far 1
as 1
the 1
church 1
door 1
he 1
brought 1
her 1
and 1
then 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
go 1
no 1
farther 1
he 1
conveniently 1
vanished 1
away 1
by 1
the 1
old 1
trick 1
of 1
stepping 1
in 1
at 1
one 1
door 1
of 1
a 1
four 1
wheeler 1
and 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
chain 1
of 1
events 1
Mr 1
Windibank 1
Our 1
visitor 1
had 1
recovered 1
something 1
of 1
his 1
assurance 1
while 1
Holmes 1
had 1
been 1
talking 1
and 1
he 1
rose 1
from 1
his 1
chair 1
now 1
with 1
a 1
cold 1
sneer 1
upon 1
his 1
pale 1
face 1
It 1
may 1
be 1
so 1
or 1
it 1
may 1
not 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
so 1
very 1
sharp 1
you 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
sharp 1
enough 1
to 1
know 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
you 1
who 1
are 1
breaking 1
the 1
law 1
now 1
and 1
not 1
me 1
I 1
have 1
done 1
nothing 1
actionable 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
but 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
you 1
keep 1
that 1
door 1
locked 1
you 1
lay 1
yourself 1
open 1
to 1
an 1
action 1
for 1
assault 1
and 1
illegal 1
constraint 1
The 1
law 1
cannot 1
as 1
you 1
say 1
touch 1
you 1
said 1
Holmes 1
unlocking 1
and 1
throwing 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
yet 1
there 1
never 1
was 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
deserved 1
punishment 1
more 1
If 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
has 1
a 1
brother 1
or 1
a 1
friend 1
he 1
ought 1
to 1
lay 1
a 1
whip 1
across 1
your 1
shoulders 1
By 1
Jove 1
he 1
continued 1
flushing 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
bitter 1
sneer 1
upon 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
face 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
duties 1
to 1
my 1
client 1
but 1
here 1
s 1
a 1
hunting 1
crop 1
handy 1
and 1
I 1
think 1
I 1
shall 1
just 1
treat 1
myself 1
to 1
He 1
took 1
two 1
swift 1
steps 1
to 1
the 1
whip 1
but 1
before 1
he 1
could 1
grasp 1
it 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
wild 1
clatter 1
of 1
steps 1
upon 1
the 1
stairs 1
the 1
heavy 1
hall 1
door 1
banged 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
window 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
Mr 1
James 1
Windibank 1
running 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
his 1
speed 1
down 1
the 1
road 1
There 1
s 1
a 1
cold 1
blooded 1
scoundrel 1
said 1
Holmes 1
laughing 1
as 1
he 1
threw 1
himself 1
down 1
into 1
his 1
chair 1
once 1
more 1
That 1
fellow 1
will 1
rise 1
from 1
crime 1
to 1
crime 1
until 1
he 1
does 1
something 1
very 1
bad 1
and 1
ends 1
on 1
a 1
gallows 1
The 1
case 1
has 1
in 1
some 1
respects 1
been 1
not 1
entirely 1
devoid 1
of 1
interest 1
I 1
cannot 1
now 1
entirely 1
see 1
all 1
the 1
steps 1
of 1
your 1
reasoning 1
I 1
remarked 1
Well 1
of 1
course 1
it 1
was 1
obvious 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
that 1
this 1
Mr 1
Hosmer 1
Angel 1
must 1
have 1
some 1
strong 1
object 1
for 1
his 1
curious 1
conduct 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
equally 1
clear 1
that 1
the 1
only 1
man 1
who 1
really 1
profited 1
by 1
the 1
incident 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
was 1
the 1
stepfather 1
Then 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
the 1
two 1
men 1
were 1
never 1
together 1
but 1
that 1
the 1
one 1
always 1
appeared 1
when 1
the 1
other 1
was 1
away 1
was 1
suggestive 1
So 1
were 1
the 1
tinted 1
spectacles 1
and 1
the 1
curious 1
voice 1
which 1
both 1
hinted 1
at 1
a 1
disguise 1
as 1
did 1
the 1
bushy 1
whiskers 1
My 1
suspicions 1
were 1
all 1
confirmed 1
by 1
his 1
peculiar 1
action 1
in 1
typewriting 1
his 1
signature 1
which 1
of 1
course 1
inferred 1
that 1
his 1
handwriting 1
was 1
so 1
familiar 1
to 1
her 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
recognise 1
even 1
the 1
smallest 1
sample 1
of 1
it 1
You 1
see 1
all 1
these 1
isolated 1
facts 1
together 1
with 1
many 1
minor 1
ones 1
all 1
pointed 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
direction 1
And 1
how 1
did 1
you 1
verify 1
them 1
Having 1
once 1
spotted 1
my 1
man 1
it 1
was 1
easy 1
to 1
get 1
corroboration 1
I 1
knew 1
the 1
firm 1
for 1
which 1
this 1
man 1
worked 1
Having 1
taken 1
the 1
printed 1
description 1
I 1
eliminated 1
everything 1
from 1
it 1
which 1
could 1
be 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
a 1
disguise 1
the 1
whiskers 1
the 1
glasses 1
the 1
voice 1
and 1
I 1
sent 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
firm 1
with 1
a 1
request 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
inform 1
me 1
whether 1
it 1
answered 1
to 1
the 1
description 1
of 1
any 1
of 1
their 1
travellers 1
I 1
had 1
already 1
noticed 1
the 1
peculiarities 1
of 1
the 1
typewriter 1
and 1
I 1
wrote 1
to 1
the 1
man 1
himself 1
at 1
his 1
business 1
address 1
asking 1
him 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
come 1
here 1
As 1
I 1
expected 1
his 1
reply 1
was 1
typewritten 1
and 1
revealed 1
the 1
same 1
trivial 1
but 1
characteristic 1
defects 1
The 1
same 1
post 1
brought 1
me 1
a 1
letter 1
from 1
Westhouse 1
Marbank 1
of 1
Fenchurch 1
Street 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
the 1
description 1
tallied 1
in 1
every 1
respect 1
with 1
that 1
of 1
their 1
employe 1
James 1
Windibank 1
Voila 1
tout 1
And 1
Miss 1
Sutherland 1
If 1
I 1
tell 1
her 1
she 1
will 1
not 1
believe 1
me 1
You 1
may 1
remember 1
the 1
old 1
Persian 1
saying 1
There 1
is 1
danger 1
for 1
him 1
who 1
taketh 1
the 1
tiger 1
cub 1
and 1
danger 1
also 1
for 1
whoso 1
snatches 1
a 1
delusion 1
from 1
a 1
woman 1
There 1
is 1
as 1
much 1
sense 1
in 1
Hafiz 1
as 1
in 1
Horace 1
and 1
as 1
much 1
knowledge 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
ADVENTURE 1
IV 1
THE 1
BOSCOMBE 1
VALLEY 1
MYSTERY 1
We 1
were 1
seated 1
at 1
breakfast 1
one 1
morning 1
my 1
wife 1
and 1
I 1
when 1
the 1
maid 1
brought 1
in 1
a 1
telegram 1
It 1
was 1
from 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
and 1
ran 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
Have 1
you 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
days 1
to 1
spare 1
Have 1
just 1
been 1
wired 1
for 1
from 1
the 1
west 1
of 1
England 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
Boscombe 1
Valley 1
tragedy 1
Shall 1
be 1
glad 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
Air 1
and 1
scenery 1
perfect 1
Leave 1
Paddington 1
by 1
the 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
say 1
dear 1
said 1
my 1
wife 1
looking 1
across 1
at 1
me 1
Will 1
you 1
go 1
I 1
really 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
fairly 1
long 1
list 1
at 1
present 1
Oh 1
Anstruther 1
would 1
do 1
your 1
work 1
for 1
you 1
You 1
have 1
been 1
looking 1
a 1
little 1
pale 1
lately 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
the 1
change 1
would 1
do 1
you 1
good 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
always 1
so 1
interested 1
in 1
Mr 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
cases 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
ungrateful 1
if 1
I 1
were 1
not 1
seeing 1
what 1
I 1
gained 1
through 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
I 1
answered 1
But 1
if 1
I 1
am 1
to 1
go 1
I 1
must 1
pack 1
at 1
once 1
for 1
I 1
have 1
only 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
My 1
experience 1
of 1
camp 1
life 1
in 1
Afghanistan 1
had 1
at 1
least 1
had 1
the 1
effect 1
of 1
making 1
me 1
a 1
prompt 1
and 1
ready 1
traveller 1
My 1
wants 1
were 1
few 1
and 1
simple 1
so 1
that 1
in 1
less 1
than 1
the 1
time 1
stated 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
cab 1
with 1
my 1
valise 1
rattling 1
away 1
to 1
Paddington 1
Station 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
was 1
pacing 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
platform 1
his 1
tall 1
gaunt 1
figure 1
made 1
even 1
gaunter 1
and 1
taller 1
by 1
his 1
long 1
grey 1
travelling 1
cloak 1
and 1
close 1
fitting 1
cloth 1
cap 1
It 1
is 1
really 1
very 1
good 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
come 1
Watson 1
said 1
he 1
It 1
makes 1
a 1
considerable 1
difference 1
to 1
me 1
having 1
someone 1
with 1
me 1
on 1
whom 1
I 1
can 1
thoroughly 1
rely 1
Local 1
aid 1
is 1
always 1
either 1
worthless 1
or 1
else 1
biassed 1
If 1
you 1
will 1
keep 1
the 1
two 1
corner 1
seats 1
I 1
shall 1
get 1
the 1
tickets 1
We 1
had 1
the 1
carriage 1
to 1
ourselves 1
save 1
for 1
an 1
immense 1
litter 1
of 1
papers 1
which 1
Holmes 1
had 1
brought 1
with 1
him 1
Among 1
these 1
he 1
rummaged 1
and 1
read 1
with 1
intervals 1
of 1
note 1
taking 1
and 1
of 1
meditation 1
until 1
we 1
were 1
past 1
Reading 1
Then 1
he 1
suddenly 1
rolled 1
them 1
all 1
into 1
a 1
gigantic 1
ball 1
and 1
tossed 1
them 1
up 1
onto 1
the 1
rack 1
Have 1
you 1
heard 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
case 1
he 1
asked 1
Not 1
a 1
word 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
seen 1
a 1
paper 1
for 1
some 1
days 1
The 1
London 1
press 1
has 1
not 1
had 1
very 1
full 1
accounts 1
I 1
have 1
just 1
been 1
looking 1
through 1
all 1
the 1
recent 1
papers 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
master 1
the 1
particulars 1
It 1
seems 1
from 1
what 1
I 1
gather 1
to 1
be 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
simple 1
cases 1
which 1
are 1
so 1
extremely 1
difficult 1
That 1
sounds 1
a 1
little 1
paradoxical 1
But 1
it 1
is 1
profoundly 1
true 1
Singularity 1
is 1
almost 1
invariably 1
a 1
clue 1
The 1
more 1
featureless 1
and 1
commonplace 1
a 1
crime 1
is 1
the 1
more 1
difficult 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
bring 1
it 1
home 1
In 1
this 1
case 1
however 1
they 1
have 1
established 1
a 1
very 1
serious 1
case 1
against 1
the 1
son 1
of 1
the 1
murdered 1
man 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
murder 1
then 1
Well 1
it 1
is 1
conjectured 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
I 1
shall 1
take 1
nothing 1
for 1
granted 1
until 1
I 1
have 1
the 1
opportunity 1
of 1
looking 1
personally 1
into 1
it 1
I 1
will 1
explain 1
the 1
state 1
of 1
things 1
to 1
you 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
understand 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
few 1
words 1
Boscombe 1
Valley 1
is 1
a 1
country 1
district 1
not 1
very 1
far 1
from 1
Ross 1
in 1
Herefordshire 1
The 1
largest 1
landed 1
proprietor 1
in 1
that 1
part 1
is 1
a 1
Mr 1
John 1
Turner 1
who 1
made 1
his 1
money 1
in 1
Australia 1
and 1
returned 1
some 1
years 1
ago 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
country 1
One 1
of 1
the 1
farms 1
which 1
he 1
held 1
that 1
of 1
Hatherley 1
was 1
let 1
to 1
Mr 1
Charles 1
McCarthy 1
who 1
was 1
also 1
an 1
ex 1
Australian 1
The 1
men 1
had 1
known 1
each 1
other 1
in 1
the 1
colonies 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
unnatural 1
that 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
settle 1
down 1
they 1
should 1
do 1
so 1
as 1
near 1
each 1
other 1
as 1
possible 1
Turner 1
was 1
apparently 1
the 1
richer 1
man 1
so 1
McCarthy 1
became 1
his 1
tenant 1
but 1
still 1
remained 1
it 1
seems 1
upon 1
terms 1
of 1
perfect 1
equality 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
frequently 1
together 1
McCarthy 1
had 1
one 1
son 1
a 1
lad 1
of 1
eighteen 1
and 1
Turner 1
had 1
an 1
only 1
daughter 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
age 1
but 1
neither 1
of 1
them 1
had 1
wives 1
living 1
They 1
appear 1
to 1
have 1
avoided 1
the 1
society 1
of 1
the 1
neighbouring 1
English 1
families 1
and 1
to 1
have 1
led 1
retired 1
lives 1
though 1
both 1
the 1
McCarthys 1
were 1
fond 1
of 1
sport 1
and 1
were 1
frequently 1
seen 1
at 1
the 1
race 1
meetings 1
of 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
McCarthy 1
kept 1
two 1
servants 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
a 1
girl 1
Turner 1
had 1
a 1
considerable 1
household 1
some 1
half 1
dozen 1
at 1
the 1
least 1
That 1
is 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
gather 1
about 1
the 1
families 1
Now 1
for 1
the 1
facts 1
On 1
June 1
rd 1
that 1
is 1
on 1
Monday 1
last 1
McCarthy 1
left 1
his 1
house 1
at 1
Hatherley 1
about 1
three 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
and 1
walked 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
Boscombe 1
Pool 1
which 1
is 1
a 1
small 1
lake 1
formed 1
by 1
the 1
spreading 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
stream 1
which 1
runs 1
down 1
the 1
Boscombe 1
Valley 1
He 1
had 1
been 1
out 1
with 1
his 1
serving 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
at 1
Ross 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
told 1
the 1
man 1
that 1
he 1
must 1
hurry 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
an 1
appointment 1
of 1
importance 1
to 1
keep 1
at 1
three 1
From 1
that 1
appointment 1
he 1
never 1
came 1
back 1
alive 1
From 1
Hatherley 1
Farm 1
house 1
to 1
the 1
Boscombe 1
Pool 1
is 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
and 1
two 1
people 1
saw 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
passed 1
over 1
this 1
ground 1
One 1
was 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
whose 1
name 1
is 1
not 1
mentioned 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
was 1
William 1
Crowder 1
a 1
game 1
keeper 1
in 1
the 1
employ 1
of 1
Mr 1
Turner 1
Both 1
these 1
witnesses 1
depose 1
that 1
Mr 1
McCarthy 1
was 1
walking 1
alone 1
The 1
game 1
keeper 1
adds 1
that 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
of 1
his 1
seeing 1
Mr 1
McCarthy 1
pass 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
his 1
son 1
Mr 1
James 1
McCarthy 1
going 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
with 1
a 1
gun 1
under 1
his 1
arm 1
To 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
his 1
belief 1
the 1
father 1
was 1
actually 1
in 1
sight 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
the 1
son 1
was 1
following 1
him 1
He 1
thought 1
no 1
more 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
until 1
he 1
heard 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
of 1
the 1
tragedy 1
that 1
had 1
occurred 1
The 1
two 1
McCarthys 1
were 1
seen 1
after 1
the 1
time 1
when 1
William 1
Crowder 1
the 1
game 1
keeper 1
lost 1
sight 1
of 1
them 1
The 1
Boscombe 1
Pool 1
is 1
thickly 1
wooded 1
round 1
with 1
just 1
a 1
fringe 1
of 1
grass 1
and 1
of 1
reeds 1
round 1
the 1
edge 1
A 1
girl 1
of 1
fourteen 1
Patience 1
Moran 1
who 1
is 1
the 1
daughter 1
of 1
the 1
lodge 1
keeper 1
of 1
the 1
Boscombe 1
Valley 1
estate 1
was 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
picking 1
flowers 1
She 1
states 1
that 1
while 1
she 1
was 1
there 1
she 1
saw 1
at 1
the 1
border 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
and 1
close 1
by 1
the 1
lake 1
Mr 1
McCarthy 1
and 1
his 1
son 1
and 1
that 1
they 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
having 1
a 1
violent 1
quarrel 1
She 1
heard 1
Mr 1
McCarthy 1
the 1
elder 1
using 1
very 1
strong 1
language 1
to 1
his 1
son 1
and 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
latter 1
raise 1
up 1
his 1
hand 1
as 1
if 1
to 1
strike 1
his 1
father 1
She 1
was 1
so 1
frightened 1
by 1
their 1
violence 1
that 1
she 1
ran 1
away 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
mother 1
when 1
she 1
reached 1
home 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
left 1
the 1
two 1
McCarthys 1
quarrelling 1
near 1
Boscombe 1
Pool 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
afraid 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
fight 1
She 1
had 1
hardly 1
said 1
the 1
words 1
when 1
young 1
Mr 1
McCarthy 1
came 1
running 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
lodge 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
found 1
his 1
father 1
dead 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
and 1
to 1
ask 1
for 1
the 1
help 1
of 1
the 1
lodge 1
keeper 1
He 1
was 1
much 1
excited 1
without 1
either 1
his 1
gun 1
or 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
his 1
right 1
hand 1
and 1
sleeve 1
were 1
observed 1
to 1
be 1
stained 1
with 1
fresh 1
blood 1
On 1
following 1
him 1
they 1
found 1
the 1
dead 1
body 1
stretched 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
grass 1
beside 1
the 1
pool 1
The 1
head 1
had 1
been 1
beaten 1
in 1
by 1
repeated 1
blows 1
of 1
some 1
heavy 1
and 1
blunt 1
weapon 1
The 1
injuries 1
were 1
such 1
as 1
might 1
very 1
well 1
have 1
been 1
inflicted 1
by 1
the 1
butt 1
end 1
of 1
his 1
son 1
s 1
gun 1
which 1
was 1
found 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
grass 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
paces 1
of 1
the 1
body 1
Under 1
these 1
circumstances 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
was 1
instantly 1
arrested 1
and 1
a 1
verdict 1
of 1
wilful 1
murder 1
having 1
been 1
returned 1
at 1
the 1
inquest 1
on 1
Tuesday 1
he 1
was 1
on 1
Wednesday 1
brought 1
before 1
the 1
magistrates 1
at 1
Ross 1
who 1
have 1
referred 1
the 1
case 1
to 1
the 1
next 1
Assizes 1
Those 1
are 1
the 1
main 1
facts 1
of 1
the 1
case 1
as 1
they 1
came 1
out 1
before 1
the 1
coroner 1
and 1
the 1
police 1
court 1
I 1
could 1
hardly 1
imagine 1
a 1
more 1
damning 1
case 1
I 1
remarked 1
If 1
ever 1
circumstantial 1
evidence 1
pointed 1
to 1
a 1
criminal 1
it 1
does 1
so 1
here 1
Circumstantial 1
evidence 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
tricky 1
thing 1
answered 1
Holmes 1
thoughtfully 1
It 1
may 1
seem 1
to 1
point 1
very 1
straight 1
to 1
one 1
thing 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
shift 1
your 1
own 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
a 1
little 1
you 1
may 1
find 1
it 1
pointing 1
in 1
an 1
equally 1
uncompromising 1
manner 1
to 1
something 1
entirely 1
different 1
It 1
must 1
be 1
confessed 1
however 1
that 1
the 1
case 1
looks 1
exceedingly 1
grave 1
against 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
possible 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
indeed 1
the 1
culprit 1
There 1
are 1
several 1
people 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
however 1
and 1
among 1
them 1
Miss 1
Turner 1
the 1
daughter 1
of 1
the 1
neighbouring 1
landowner 1
who 1
believe 1
in 1
his 1
innocence 1
and 1
who 1
have 1
retained 1
Lestrade 1
whom 1
you 1
may 1
recollect 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
the 1
Study 1
in 1
Scarlet 1
to 1
work 1
out 1
the 1
case 1
in 1
his 1
interest 1
Lestrade 1
being 1
rather 1
puzzled 1
has 1
referred 1
the 1
case 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
hence 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
two 1
middle 1
aged 1
gentlemen 1
are 1
flying 1
westward 1
at 1
fifty 1
miles 1
an 1
hour 1
instead 1
of 1
quietly 1
digesting 1
their 1
breakfasts 1
at 1
home 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
said 1
I 1
that 1
the 1
facts 1
are 1
so 1
obvious 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
little 1
credit 1
to 1
be 1
gained 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
case 1
There 1
is 1
nothing 1
more 1
deceptive 1
than 1
an 1
obvious 1
fact 1
he 1
answered 1
laughing 1
Besides 1
we 1
may 1
chance 1
to 1
hit 1
upon 1
some 1
other 1
obvious 1
facts 1
which 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
by 1
no 1
means 1
obvious 1
to 1
Mr 1
Lestrade 1
You 1
know 1
me 1
too 1
well 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
boasting 1
when 1
I 1
say 1
that 1
I 1
shall 1
either 1
confirm 1
or 1
destroy 1
his 1
theory 1
by 1
means 1
which 1
he 1
is 1
quite 1
incapable 1
of 1
employing 1
or 1
even 1
of 1
understanding 1
To 1
take 1
the 1
first 1
example 1
to 1
hand 1
I 1
very 1
clearly 1
perceive 1
that 1
in 1
your 1
bedroom 1
the 1
window 1
is 1
upon 1
the 1
right 1
hand 1
side 1
and 1
yet 1
I 1
question 1
whether 1
Mr 1
Lestrade 1
would 1
have 1
noted 1
even 1
so 1
self 1
evident 1
a 1
thing 1
as 1
that 1
How 1
on 1
earth 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
I 1
know 1
you 1
well 1
I 1
know 1
the 1
military 1
neatness 1
which 1
characterises 1
you 1
You 1
shave 1
every 1
morning 1
and 1
in 1
this 1
season 1
you 1
shave 1
by 1
the 1
sunlight 1
but 1
since 1
your 1
shaving 1
is 1
less 1
and 1
less 1
complete 1
as 1
we 1
get 1
farther 1
back 1
on 1
the 1
left 1
side 1
until 1
it 1
becomes 1
positively 1
slovenly 1
as 1
we 1
get 1
round 1
the 1
angle 1
of 1
the 1
jaw 1
it 1
is 1
surely 1
very 1
clear 1
that 2
side 1
is 1
less 1
illuminated 1
than 1
the 1
other 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
imagine 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
your 1
habits 1
looking 1
at 1
himself 1
in 1
an 1
equal 1
light 1
and 1
being 1
satisfied 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
result 1
I 1
only 1
quote 1
this 1
as 1
a 1
trivial 1
example 1
of 1
observation 1
and 1
inference 1
Therein 1
lies 1
my 1
metier 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
just 1
possible 1
that 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
of 1
some 1
service 1
in 1
the 1
investigation 1
which 1
lies 1
before 1
us 1
There 1
are 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
minor 1
points 1
which 1
were 1
brought 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
inquest 1
and 1
which 1
are 1
worth 1
considering 1
What 1
are 1
they 1
It 1
appears 1
that 1
his 1
arrest 1
did 1
not 1
take 1
place 1
at 1
once 1
but 1
after 1
the 1
return 1
to 1
Hatherley 1
Farm 1
On 1
the 1
inspector 1
of 1
constabulary 1
informing 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
prisoner 1
he 1
remarked 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
surprised 1
to 1
hear 1
it 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
his 1
deserts 1
This 1
observation 1
of 1
his 1
had 1
the 1
natural 1
effect 1
of 1
removing 1
any 1
traces 1
of 1
doubt 1
which 1
might 1
have 1
remained 1
in 1
the 1
minds 1
of 1
the 1
coroner 1
s 1
jury 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
confession 1
I 1
ejaculated 1
No 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
followed 1
by 1
a 1
protestation 1
of 1
innocence 1
Coming 1
on 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
damning 1
series 1
of 1
events 1
it 1
was 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
most 1
suspicious 1
remark 1
On 1
the 1
contrary 1
said 1
Holmes 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
brightest 1
rift 1
which 1
I 1
can 1
at 1
present 1
see 1
in 1
the 1
clouds 1
However 1
innocent 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
such 1
an 1
absolute 1
imbecile 1
as 1
not 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
circumstances 1
were 1
very 1
black 1
against 1
him 1
Had 1
he 1
appeared 1
surprised 1
at 1
his 1
own 1
arrest 1
or 1
feigned 1
indignation 1
at 1
it 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
looked 1
upon 1
it 1
as 1
highly 1
suspicious 1
because 1
such 1
surprise 1
or 1
anger 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
natural 1
under 1
the 1
circumstances 1
and 1
yet 1
might 1
appear 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
best 1
policy 1
to 1
a 1
scheming 1
man 1
His 1
frank 1
acceptance 1
of 1
the 1
situation 1
marks 1
him 1
as 1
either 1
an 1
innocent 1
man 1
or 1
else 1
as 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
considerable 1
self 1
restraint 1
and 1
firmness 1
As 1
to 1
his 1
remark 1
about 1
his 1
deserts 1
it 1
was 1
also 1
not 1
unnatural 1
if 1
you 1
consider 1
that 1
he 1
stood 1
beside 1
the 1
dead 1
body 1
of 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
that 1
very 1
day 1
so 1
far 1
forgotten 1
his 1
filial 1
duty 1
as 1
to 1
bandy 1
words 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
even 1
according 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
girl 1
whose 1
evidence 1
is 1
so 1
important 1
to 1
raise 1
his 1
hand 1
as 1
if 1
to 1
strike 1
him 1
The 1
self 1
reproach 1
and 1
contrition 1
which 1
are 1
displayed 1
in 1
his 1
remark 1
appear 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
signs 1
of 1
a 1
healthy 1
mind 1
rather 1
than 1
of 1
a 1
guilty 1
one 1
I 1
shook 1
my 1
head 1
Many 1
men 1
have 1
been 1
hanged 1
on 1
far 1
slighter 1
evidence 1
I 1
remarked 1
So 1
they 1
have 1
And 1
many 1
men 1
have 1
been 1
wrongfully 1
hanged 1
What 1
is 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
s 1
own 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
It 1
is 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
not 1
very 1
encouraging 1
to 1
his 1
supporters 1
though 1
there 1
are 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
points 1
in 1
it 1
which 1
are 1
suggestive 1
You 1
will 1
find 1
it 1
here 1
and 1
may 1
read 1
it 1
for 1
yourself 1
He 1
picked 1
out 1
from 1
his 1
bundle 1
a 1
copy 1
of 1
the 1
local 1
Herefordshire 1
paper 1
and 1
having 1
turned 1
down 1
the 1
sheet 1
he 1
pointed 1
out 1
the 1
paragraph 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
unfortunate 1
young 1
man 1
had 1
given 1
his 1
own 1
statement 1
of 1
what 1
had 1
occurred 1
I 1
settled 1
myself 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
carriage 1
and 1
read 1
it 1
very 1
carefully 1
It 1
ran 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
Mr 1
James 1
McCarthy 1
the 1
only 1
son 1
of 1
the 1
deceased 1
was 1
then 1
called 1
and 1
gave 1
evidence 1
as 1
follows 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
away 1
from 1
home 1
for 1
three 1
days 1
at 1
Bristol 1
and 1
had 1
only 1
just 1
returned 1
upon 1
the 1
morning 1
of 1
last 1
Monday 1
the 1
rd 1
My 1
father 1
was 1
absent 1
from 1
home 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
my 1
arrival 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
informed 1
by 1
the 1
maid 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
driven 1
over 1
to 1
Ross 1
with 1
John 1
Cobb 1
the 1
groom 1
Shortly 1
after 1
my 1
return 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
wheels 1
of 1
his 1
trap 1
in 1
the 1
yard 1
and 1
looking 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
window 1
I 1
saw 1
him 1
get 1
out 1
and 1
walk 1
rapidly 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
yard 1
though 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
aware 1
in 1
which 1
direction 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
I 1
then 1
took 1
my 1
gun 1
and 1
strolled 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
Boscombe 1
Pool 1
with 1
the 1
intention 1
of 1
visiting 1
the 1
rabbit 1
warren 1
which 1
is 1
upon 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
On 1
my 1
way 1
I 1
saw 1
William 1
Crowder 1
the 1
game 1
keeper 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
stated 1
in 1
his 1
evidence 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
mistaken 1
in 1
thinking 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
following 1
my 1
father 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
me 1
When 1
about 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
from 1
the 1
pool 1
I 1
heard 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
Cooee 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
usual 1
signal 1
between 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
myself 1
I 1
then 1
hurried 1
forward 1
and 1
found 1
him 1
standing 1
by 1
the 1
pool 1
He 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
much 1
surprised 1
at 1
seeing 1
me 1
and 1
asked 1
me 1
rather 1
roughly 1
what 1
I 1
was 1
doing 1
there 1
A 1
conversation 1
ensued 1
which 1
led 1
to 1
high 1
words 1
and 1
almost 1
to 1
blows 1
for 1
my 1
father 1
was 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
a 1
very 1
violent 1
temper 1
Seeing 1
that 1
his 1
passion 1
was 1
becoming 1
ungovernable 1
I 1
left 1
him 1
and 1
returned 1
towards 1
Hatherley 1
Farm 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
gone 1
more 1
than 1
yards 1
however 1
when 1
I 1
heard 1
a 1
hideous 1
outcry 1
behind 1
me 1
which 1
caused 1
me 1
to 1
run 1
back 1
again 1
I 1
found 1
my 1
father 1
expiring 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
terribly 1
injured 1
I 1
dropped 1
my 1
gun 1
and 1
held 1
him 1
in 1
my 1
arms 1
but 1
he 1
almost 1
instantly 1
expired 1
I 1
knelt 1
beside 1
him 1
for 1
some 1
minutes 1
and 1
then 1
made 1
my 1
way 1
to 1
Mr 1
Turner 1
s 1
lodge 1
keeper 1
his 1
house 1
being 1
the 1
nearest 1
to 1
ask 1
for 1
assistance 1
I 1
saw 1
no 1
one 1
near 1
my 1
father 1
when 1
I 1
returned 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
idea 1
how 1
he 1
came 1
by 1
his 1
injuries 1
He 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
popular 1
man 1
being 1
somewhat 1
cold 1
and 1
forbidding 1
in 1
his 1
manners 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
I 1
know 1
no 1
active 1
enemies 1
I 1
know 1
nothing 1
further 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
The 1
Coroner 1
Did 1
your 1
father 1
make 1
any 1
statement 1
to 1
you 1
before 1
he 1
died 1
Witness 1
He 1
mumbled 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
but 1
I 1
could 1
only 1
catch 1
some 1
allusion 1
to 1
a 1
rat 1
The 1
Coroner 1
What 1
did 1
you 1
understand 1
by 1
that 1
Witness 1
It 1
conveyed 1
no 1
meaning 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
delirious 1
The 1
Coroner 1
What 1
was 1
the 1
point 1
upon 1
which 1
you 1
and 1
your 1
father 1
had 1
this 1
final 1
quarrel 1
Witness 1
I 1
should 1
prefer 1
not 1
to 1
answer 1
The 1
Coroner 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
I 1
must 1
press 1
it 1
Witness 1
It 1
is 1
really 1
impossible 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
I 1
can 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
it 1
has 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
the 1
sad 1
tragedy 1
which 1
followed 1
The 1
Coroner 1
That 1
is 1
for 1
the 1
court 1
to 1
decide 1
I 1
need 1
not 1
point 1
out 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
your 1
refusal 1
to 1
answer 1
will 1
prejudice 1
your 1
case 1
considerably 1
in 1
any 1
future 1
proceedings 1
which 1
may 1
arise 1
Witness 1
I 1
must 1
still 1
refuse 1
The 1
Coroner 1
I 1
understand 1
that 1
the 1
cry 1
of 1
Cooee 1
was 1
a 1
common 1
signal 1
between 1
you 1
and 1
your 1
father 1
Witness 1
It 1
was 1
The 1
Coroner 1
How 1
was 1
it 1
then 1
that 1
he 1
uttered 1
it 1
before 1
he 1
saw 1
you 1
and 1
before 1
he 1
even 1
knew 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
returned 1
from 1
Bristol 1
Witness 1
with 1
considerable 1
confusion 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
A 1
Juryman 1
Did 1
you 1
see 1
nothing 1
which 1
aroused 1
your 1
suspicions 1
when 1
you 1
returned 1
on 1
hearing 1
the 1
cry 1
and 1
found 1
your 1
father 1
fatally 1
injured 1
Witness 1
Nothing 1
definite 1
The 1
Coroner 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
Witness 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
disturbed 1
and 1
excited 1
as 1
I 1
rushed 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
open 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
nothing 1
except 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
Yet 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
vague 1
impression 1
that 1
as 1
I 1
ran 1
forward 1
something 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
to 1
the 1
left 1
of 1
me 1
It 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
something 1
grey 1
in 1
colour 1
a 1
coat 1
of 1
some 1
sort 1
or 1
a 1
plaid 1
perhaps 1
When 1
I 1
rose 1
from 1
my 1
father 1
I 1
looked 1
round 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
gone 1
Do 1
you 1
mean 1
that 1
it 1
disappeared 1
before 1
you 1
went 1
for 1
help 1
Yes 1
it 1
was 1
gone 1
You 1
cannot 1
say 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
No 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
feeling 1
something 1
was 1
there 1
How 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
body 1
A 1
dozen 1
yards 1
or 1
so 1
And 1
how 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
About 1
the 1
same 1
Then 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
removed 1
it 1
was 1
while 1
you 1
were 1
within 1
a 1
dozen 1
yards 1
of 1
it 1
Yes 1
but 1
with 1
my 1
back 1
towards 1
it 1
This 1
concluded 1
the 1
examination 1
of 1
the 1
witness 1
I 1
see 1
said 1
I 1
as 1
I 1
glanced 1
down 1
the 1
column 1
that 1
the 1
coroner 1
in 1
his 1
concluding 1
remarks 1
was 1
rather 1
severe 1
upon 1
young 1
McCarthy 1
He 1
calls 1
attention 1
and 1
with 1
reason 1
to 1
the 1
discrepancy 1
about 1
his 1
father 1
having 1
signalled 1
to 1
him 1
before 1
seeing 1
him 1
also 1
to 1
his 1
refusal 1
to 1
give 1
details 1
of 1
his 1
conversation 1
with 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
his 1
singular 1
account 1
of 1
his 1
father 1
s 1
dying 1
words 1
They 1
are 1
all 1
as 1
he 1
remarks 1
very 1
much 1
against 1
the 1
son 1
Holmes 1
laughed 1
softly 1
to 1
himself 1
and 1
stretched 1
himself 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
cushioned 1
seat 1
Both 1
you 1
and 1
the 1
coroner 1
have 1
been 1
at 1
some 1
pains 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
single 1
out 1
the 1
very 1
strongest 1
points 1
in 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
s 1
favour 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
you 1
alternately 1
give 1
him 1
credit 1
for 1
having 1
too 1
much 1
imagination 1
and 1
too 1
little 1
Too 1
little 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
invent 1
a 1
cause 1
of 1
quarrel 1
which 1
would 1
give 1
him 1
the 1
sympathy 1
of 1
the 1
jury 1
too 1
much 1
if 1
he 1
evolved 1
from 1
his 1
own 1
inner 1
consciousness 1
anything 1
so 1
outre 1
as 1
a 1
dying 1
reference 1
to 1
a 1
rat 1
and 1
the 1
incident 1
of 1
the 1
vanishing 1
cloth 1
No 1
sir 1
I 1
shall 1
approach 1
this 1
case 1
from 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
that 1
what 1
this 1
young 1
man 1
says 1
is 1
true 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
whither 1
that 1
hypothesis 1
will 1
lead 1
us 1
And 1
now 1
here 1
is 1
my 1
pocket 1
Petrarch 1
and 1
not 1
another 1
word 1
shall 1
I 1
say 1
of 1
this 1
case 1
until 1
we 1
are 1
on 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
action 1
We 1
lunch 1
at 1
Swindon 1
and 1
I 1
see 1
that 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
there 1
in 1
twenty 1
minutes 1
It 1
was 1
nearly 1
four 1
o 1
clock 1
when 1
we 1
at 1
last 1
after 1
passing 1
through 1
the 1
beautiful 1
Stroud 1
Valley 1
and 1
over 1
the 1
broad 1
gleaming 1
Severn 1
found 1
ourselves 1
at 1
the 1
pretty 1
little 1
country 1
town 1
of 1
Ross 1
A 1
lean 1
ferret 1
like 1
man 1
furtive 1
and 1
sly 1
looking 1
was 1
waiting 1
for 1
us 1
upon 1
the 1
platform 1
In 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
light 1
brown 1
dustcoat 1
and 1
leather 1
leggings 1
which 1
he 1
wore 1
in 1
deference 1
to 1
his 1
rustic 1
surroundings 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
difficulty 1
in 1
recognising 1
Lestrade 1
of 1
Scotland 1
Yard 1
With 1
him 1
we 1
drove 1
to 1
the 1
Hereford 1
Arms 1
where 1
a 1
room 1
had 1
already 1
been 1
engaged 1
for 1
us 1
I 1
have 1
ordered 1
a 1
carriage 1
said 1
Lestrade 1
as 1
we 1
sat 1
over 1
a 1
cup 1
of 1
tea 1
I 1
knew 1
your 1
energetic 1
nature 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
happy 1
until 1
you 1
had 1
been 1
on 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
crime 1
It 1
was 1
very 1
nice 1
and 1
complimentary 1
of 1
you 1
Holmes 1
answered 1
It 1
is 1
entirely 1
a 1
question 1
of 1
barometric 1
pressure 1
Lestrade 1
looked 1
startled 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
quite 1
follow 1
he 1
said 1
How 1
is 1
the 1
glass 1
Twenty 1
nine 1
I 1
see 1
No 1
wind 1
and 1
not 1
a 1
cloud 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
caseful 1
of 1
cigarettes 1
here 1
which 1
need 1
smoking 1
and 1
the 1
sofa 1
is 1
very 1
much 1
superior 1
to 1
the 1
usual 1
country 1
hotel 1
abomination 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
probable 1
that 1
I 1
shall 1
use 1
the 1
carriage 1
to 1
night 1
Lestrade 1
laughed 1
indulgently 1
You 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
already 1
formed 1
your 1
conclusions 1
from 1
the 1
newspapers 1
he 1
said 1
The 1
case 1
is 1
as 1
plain 1
as 1
a 1
pikestaff 1
and 1
the 1
more 1
one 1
goes 1
into 1
it 1
the 1
plainer 1
it 1
becomes 1
Still 1
of 1
course 1
one 1
can 1
t 1
refuse 1
a 1
lady 1
and 1
such 1
a 1
very 1
positive 1
one 1
too 1
She 1
has 1
heard 1
of 1
you 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
your 1
opinion 1
though 1
I 1
repeatedly 1
told 1
her 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
which 1
you 1
could 1
do 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
already 1
done 1
Why 1
bless 1
my 1
soul 1
here 1
is 1
her 1
carriage 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
He 1
had 1
hardly 1
spoken 1
before 1
there 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
lovely 1
young 1
women 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
seen 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
Her 1
violet 1
eyes 1
shining 1
her 1
lips 1
parted 1
a 1
pink 1
flush 1
upon 1
her 1
cheeks 1
all 1
thought 1
of 1
her 1
natural 1
reserve 1
lost 1
in 1
her 1
overpowering 1
excitement 1
and 1
concern 1
Oh 1
Mr 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
she 1
cried 1
glancing 1
from 1
one 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
of 1
us 1
and 1
finally 1
with 1
a 1
woman 1
s 1
quick 1
intuition 1
fastening 1
upon 1
my 1
companion 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
glad 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
come 1
I 1
have 1
driven 1
down 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
so 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
James 1
didn 1
t 1
do 1
it 1
I 1
know 1
it 1
and 1
I 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
start 1
upon 1
your 1
work 1
knowing 1
it 1
too 1
Never 1
let 1
yourself 1
doubt 1
upon 1
that 1
point 1
We 1
have 1
known 1
each 1
other 1
since 1
we 1
were 1
little 1
children 1
and 1
I 1
know 1
his 1
faults 1
as 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
does 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
too 1
tender 1
hearted 1
to 1
hurt 1
a 1
fly 1
Such 1
a 1
charge 1
is 1
absurd 1
to 1
anyone 1
who 1
really 1
knows 1
him 1
I 1
hope 1
we 1
may 1
clear 1
him 1
Miss 1
Turner 1
said 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
You 1
may 1
rely 1
upon 1
my 1
doing 1
all 1
that 1
I 1
can 1
But 1
you 1
have 1
read 1
the 1
evidence 1
You 1
have 1
formed 1
some 1
conclusion 1
Do 1
you 1
not 1
see 1
some 1
loophole 1
some 1
flaw 1
Do 1
you 1
not 1
yourself 1
think 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
innocent 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
probable 1
There 1
now 1
she 1
cried 1
throwing 1
back 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
looking 1
defiantly 1
at 1
Lestrade 1
You 1
hear 1
He 1
gives 1
me 1
hopes 1
Lestrade 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
my 1
colleague 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
little 1
quick 1
in 1
forming 1
his 1
conclusions 1
he 1
said 1
But 1
he 1
is 1
right 1
Oh 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
right 1
James 1
never 1
did 1
it 1
And 1
about 1
his 1
quarrel 1
with 1
his 1
father 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
that 1
the 1
reason 1
why 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
speak 1
about 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
coroner 1
was 1
because 1
I 1
was 1
concerned 1
in 1
it 1
In 1
what 1
way 1
asked 1
Holmes 1
It 1
is 1
no 1
time 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
hide 1
anything 1
James 1
and 1
his 1
father 1
had 1
many 1
disagreements 1
about 1
me 1
Mr 1
McCarthy 1
was 1
very 1
anxious 1
that 1
there 1
should 1
be 1
a 1
marriage 1
between 1
us 1
James 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
always 1
loved 1
each 1
other 1
as 1
brother 1
and 1
sister 1
but 1
of 1
course 1
he 1
is 1
young 1
and 1
has 1
seen 1
very 1
little 1
of 1
life 1
yet 1
and 2
well 1
he 1
naturally 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
like 1
that 1
yet 1
So 1
there 1
were 1
quarrels 1
and 1
this 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
And 1
your 1
father 1
asked 1
Holmes 1
Was 1
he 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
union 1
No 1
he 1
was 1
averse 1
to 1
it 1
also 1
No 1
one 1
but 1
Mr 1
McCarthy 1
was 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
it 1
A 1
quick 1
blush 1
passed 1
over 1
her 1
fresh 1
young 1
face 1
as 1
Holmes 1
shot 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
keen 1
questioning 1
glances 1
at 1
her 1
Thank 1
you 1
for 1
this 1
information 1
said 1
he 1
May 1
I 1
see 1
your 1
father 1
if 1
I 1
call 1
to 1
morrow 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
the 1
doctor 1
won 1
t 1
allow 1
it 1
The 1
doctor 1
Yes 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
heard 1
Poor 1
father 1
has 1
never 1
been 1
strong 1
for 1
years 1
back 1
but 1
this 1
has 1
broken 1
him 1
down 1
completely 1
He 1
has 1
taken 1
to 1
his 1
bed 1
and 1
Dr 1
Willows 1
says 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
wreck 1
and 1
that 1
his 1
nervous 1
system 1
is 1
shattered 1
Mr 1
McCarthy 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
man 1
alive 1
who 1
had 1
known 1
dad 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
days 1
in 1
Victoria 1
Ha 1
In 1
Victoria 1
That 1
is 1
important 1
Yes 1
at 1
the 1
mines 1
Quite 1
so 1
at 1
the 1
gold 1
mines 1
where 1
as 1
I 1
understand 1
Mr 1
Turner 1
made 1
his 1
money 1
Yes 1
certainly 1
Thank 1
you 1
Miss 1
Turner 1
You 1
have 1
been 1
of 1
material 1
assistance 1
to 1
me 1
You 1
will 1
tell 1
me 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
any 1
news 1
to 1
morrow 1
No 1
doubt 1
you 1
will 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
prison 1
to 1
see 1
James 1
Oh 1
if 1
you 1
do 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
do 1
tell 1
him 1
that 1
I 1
know 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
innocent 1
I 1
will 1
Miss 1
Turner 1
I 1
must 1
go 1
home 1
now 1
for 1
dad 1
is 1
very 1
ill 1
and 1
he 1
misses 1
me 1
so 1
if 1
I 1
leave 1
him 1
Good 1
bye 1
and 1
God 1
help 1
you 1
in 1
your 1
undertaking 1
She 1
hurried 1
from 1
the 1
room 1
as 1
impulsively 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
entered 1
and 1
we 1
heard 1
the 1
wheels 1
of 1
her 1
carriage 1
rattle 1
off 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
I 1
am 1
ashamed 1
of 1
you 1
Holmes 1
said 1
Lestrade 1
with 1
dignity 1
after 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
silence 1
Why 1
should 1
you 1
raise 1
up 1
hopes 1
which 1
you 1
are 1
bound 1
to 1
disappoint 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
over 1
tender 1
of 1
heart 1
but 1
I 1
call 1
it 1
cruel 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
see 1
my 1
way 1
to 1
clearing 1
James 1
McCarthy 1
said 1
Holmes 1
Have 1
you 1
an 1
order 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
in 1
prison 1
Yes 1
but 1
only 1
for 1
you 1
and 1
me 1
Then 1
I 1
shall 1
reconsider 1
my 1
resolution 1
about 1
going 1
out 1
We 1
have 1
still 1
time 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
train 1
to 1
Hereford 1
and 1
see 1
him 1
to 1
night 1
Ample 1
Then 1
let 1
us 1
do 1
so 1
Watson 1
I 1
fear 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
it 1
very 1
slow 1
but 1
I 1
shall 1
only 1
be 1
away 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
hours 1
I 1
walked 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
station 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
then 1
wandered 1
through 1
the 1
streets 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
town 1
finally 1
returning 1
to 1
the 1
hotel 1
where 1
I 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
sofa 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
interest 1
myself 1
in 1
a 1
yellow 1
backed 1
novel 1
The 1
puny 1
plot 1
of 1
the 1
story 1
was 1
so 1
thin 1
however 1
when 1
compared 1
to 1
the 1
deep 1
mystery 1
through 1
which 1
we 1
were 1
groping 1
and 1
I 1
found 1
my 1
attention 1
wander 1
so 1
continually 1
from 1
the 1
action 1
to 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
I 1
at 1
last 1
flung 1
it 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
gave 1
myself 1
up 1
entirely 1
to 1
a 1
consideration 1
of 1
the 1
events 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
Supposing 1
that 1
this 1
unhappy 1
young 1
man 1
s 1
story 1
were 1
absolutely 1
true 1
then 1
what 1
hellish 1
thing 1
what 1
absolutely 1
unforeseen 1
and 1
extraordinary 1
calamity 1
could 1
have 1
occurred 1
between 1
the 1
time 1
when 1
he 1
parted 1
from 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
the 1
moment 1
when 1
drawn 1
back 1
by 1
his 1
screams 1
he 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
glade 1
It 1
was 1
something 1
terrible 1
and 1
deadly 1
What 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
Might 1
not 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
injuries 1
reveal 1
something 1
to 1
my 1
medical 1
instincts 1
I 1
rang 1
the 1
bell 1
and 1
called 1
for 1
the 1
weekly 1
county 1
paper 1
which 1
contained 1
a 1
verbatim 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
inquest 1
In 1
the 1
surgeon 1
s 1
deposition 1
it 1
was 1
stated 1
that 1
the 1
posterior 1
third 1
of 1
the 1
left 1
parietal 1
bone 1
and 1
the 1
left 1
half 1
of 1
the 1
occipital 1
bone 1
had 1
been 1
shattered 1
by 1
a 1
heavy 1
blow 1
from 1
a 1
blunt 1
weapon 1
I 1
marked 1
the 1
spot 1
upon 1
my 1
own 1
head 1
Clearly 1
such 1
a 1
blow 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
struck 1
from 1
behind 1
That 1
was 1
to 1
some 1
extent 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
the 1
accused 1
as 1
when 1
seen 1
quarrelling 1
he 1
was 1
face 1
to 1
face 1
with 1
his 1
father 1
Still 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
go 1
for 1
very 1
much 1
for 1
the 1
older 1
man 1
might 1
have 1
turned 1
his 1
back 1
before 1
the 1
blow 1
fell 1
Still 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
worth 1
while 1
to 1
call 1
Holmes 1
attention 1
to 1
it 1
Then 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
peculiar 1
dying 1
reference 1
to 1
a 1
rat 1
What 1
could 1
that 1
mean 1
It 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
delirium 1
A 1
man 1
dying 1
from 1
a 1
sudden 1
blow 1
does 1
not 1
commonly 1
become 1
delirious 1
No 1
it 1
was 1
more 1
likely 1
to 1
be 1
an 1
attempt 1
to 1
explain 1
how 1
he 1
met 1
his 1
fate 1
But 1
what 1
could 1
it 1
indicate 1
I 1
cudgelled 1
my 1
brains 1
to 1
find 1
some 1
possible 1
explanation 1
And 1
then 1
the 1
incident 1
of 1
the 1
grey 1
cloth 1
seen 1
by 1
young 1
McCarthy 1
If 1
that 1
were 1
true 1
the 1
murderer 1
must 1
have 1
dropped 1
some 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
dress 1
presumably 1
his 1
overcoat 1
in 1
his 1
flight 1
and 1
must 1
have 1
had 1
the 1
hardihood 1
to 1
return 1
and 1
to 1
carry 1
it 1
away 1
at 1
the 1
instant 1
when 1
the 1
son 1
was 1
kneeling 1
with 1
his 1
back 1
turned 1
not 1
a 1
dozen 1
paces 1
off 1
What 1
a 1
tissue 1
of 1
mysteries 1
and 1
improbabilities 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
was 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
wonder 1
at 1
Lestrade 1
s 1
opinion 1
and 1
yet 1
I 1
had 1
so 1
much 1
faith 1
in 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
insight 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
lose 1
hope 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
every 1
fresh 1
fact 1
seemed 1
to 1
strengthen 1
his 1
conviction 1
of 1
young 1
McCarthy 1
s 1
innocence 1
It 1
was 1
late 1
before 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
returned 1
He 1
came 1
back 1
alone 1
for 1
Lestrade 1
was 1
staying 1
in 1
lodgings 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
The 1
glass 1
still 1
keeps 1
very 1
high 1
he 1
remarked 1
as 1
he 1
sat 1
down 1
It 1
is 1
of 1
importance 1
that 1
it 1
should 1
not 1
rain 1
before 1
we 1
are 1
able 1
to 1
go 1
over 1
the 1
ground 1
On 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
a 1
man 1
should 1
be 1
at 1
his 1
very 1
best 1
and 1
keenest 1
for 1
such 1
nice 1
work 1
as 1
that 1
and 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
when 1
fagged 1
by 1
a 1
long 1
journey 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
young 1
McCarthy 1
And 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
learn 1
from 1
him 1
Nothing 1
Could 1
he 1
throw 1
no 1
light 1
None 1
at 1
all 1
I 1
was 1
inclined 1
to 1
think 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
that 1
he 1
knew 1
who 1
had 1
done 1
it 1
and 1
was 1
screening 1
him 1
or 1
her 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
convinced 1
now 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
as 1
puzzled 1
as 1
everyone 1
else 1
He 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
very 1
quick 1
witted 1
youth 1
though 1
comely 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
and 1
I 1
should 1
think 1
sound 1
at 1
heart 1
I 1
cannot 1
admire 1
his 1
taste 1
I 1
remarked 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
indeed 1
a 1
fact 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
averse 1
to 1
a 1
marriage 1
with 1
so 1
charming 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
as 1
this 1
Miss 1
Turner 1
Ah 1
thereby 1
hangs 1
a 1
rather 1
painful 1
tale 1
This 1
fellow 1
is 1
madly 1
insanely 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
her 1
but 1
some 1
two 1
years 1
ago 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
lad 1
and 1
before 1
he 1
really 1
knew 1
her 1
for 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
away 1
five 1
years 1
at 1
a 1
boarding 1
school 1
what 1
does 1
the 1
idiot 1
do 1
but 1
get 1
into 1
the 1
clutches 1
of 1
a 1
barmaid 1
in 1
Bristol 1
and 1
marry 1
her 1
at 1
a 1
registry 1
office 1
No 1
one 1
knows 1
a 1
word 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
but 1
you 1
can 1
imagine 1
how 1
maddening 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
upbraided 1
for 1
not 1
doing 1
what 1
he 1
would 1
give 1
his 1
very 1
eyes 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
what 1
he 1
knows 1
to 1
be 1
absolutely 1
impossible 1
It 1
was 1
sheer 1
frenzy 1
of 1
this 1
sort 1
which 1
made 1
him 1
throw 1
his 1
hands 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
when 1
his 1
father 1
at 1
their 1
last 1
interview 1
was 1
goading 1
him 1
on 1
to 1
propose 1
to 1
Miss 1
Turner 1
On 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
means 1
of 1
supporting 1
himself 1
and 1
his 1
father 1
who 1
was 1
by 1
all 1
accounts 1
a 1
very 1
hard 1
man 1
would 1
have 1
thrown 1
him 1
over 1
utterly 1
had 1
he 1
known 1
the 1
truth 1
It 1
was 1
with 1
his 1
barmaid 1
wife 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
spent 1
the 1
last 1
three 1
days 1
in 1
Bristol 1
and 1
his 1
father 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
Mark 1
that 1
point 1
It 1
is 1
of 1
importance 1
Good 1
has 1
come 1
out 1
of 1
evil 1
however 1
for 1
the 1
barmaid 1
finding 1
from 1
the 1
papers 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
in 1
serious 1
trouble 1
and 1
likely 1
to 1
be 1
hanged 1
has 1
thrown 1
him 1
over 1
utterly 1
and 1
has 1
written 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
she 1
has 1
a 1
husband 1
already 1
in 1
the 1
Bermuda 1
Dockyard 1
so 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
really 1
no 1
tie 1
between 1
them 1
I 1
think 1
that 2
bit 1
of 1
news 1
has 1
consoled 1
young 1
McCarthy 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
suffered 1
But 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
innocent 1
who 1
has 1
done 1
it 1
Ah 1
who 1
I 1
would 1
call 1
your 1
attention 1
very 1
particularly 1
to 1
two 1
points 1
One 1
is 1
that 1
the 1
murdered 1
man 1
had 1
an 1
appointment 1
with 1
someone 1
at 1
the 1
pool 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
someone 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
his 1
son 1
for 1
his 1
son 1
was 1
away 1
and 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
when 1
he 1
would 1
return 1
The 1
second 1
is 1
that 1
the 1
murdered 1
man 1
was 1
heard 1
to 1
cry 1
Cooee 1
before 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
his 1
son 1
had 1
returned 1
Those 1
are 1
the 1
crucial 1
points 1
upon 1
which 1
the 1
case 1
depends 1
And 1
now 1
let 1
us 1
talk 1
about 1
George 1
Meredith 1
if 1
you 1
please 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
leave 1
all 1
minor 1
matters 1
until 1
to 1
morrow 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
rain 1
as 1
Holmes 1
had 1
foretold 1
and 1
the 1
morning 1
broke 1
bright 1
and 1
cloudless 1
At 1
nine 1
o 1
clock 1
Lestrade 1
called 1
for 1
us 1
with 1
the 1
carriage 1
and 1
we 1
set 1
off 1
for 1
Hatherley 1
Farm 1
and 1
the 1
Boscombe 1
Pool 1
There 1
is 1
serious 1
news 1
this 1
morning 1
Lestrade 1
observed 1
It 1
is 1
said 1
that 1
Mr 1
Turner 1
of 1
the 1
Hall 1
is 1
so 1
ill 1
that 1
his 1
life 1
is 1
despaired 1
of 1
An 1
elderly 1
man 1
I 1
presume 1
said 1
Holmes 1
About 1
sixty 1
but 1
his 1
constitution 1
has 1
been 1
shattered 1
by 1
his 1
life 1
abroad 1
and 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
in 1
failing 1
health 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
This 1
business 1
has 1
had 1
a 1
very 1
bad 1
effect 1
upon 1
him 1
He 1
was 1
an 1
old 1
friend 1
of 1
McCarthy 1
s 1
and 1
I 1
may 1
add 1
a 1
great 1
benefactor 1
to 1
him 1
for 1
I 1
have 1
learned 1
that 1
he 1
gave 1
him 1
Hatherley 1
Farm 1
rent 1
free 1
Indeed 1
That 1
is 1
interesting 1
said 1
Holmes 1
Oh 1
yes 1
In 1
a 1
hundred 1
other 1
ways 1
he 1
has 1
helped 1
him 1
Everybody 1
about 1
here 1
speaks 1
of 1
his 1
kindness 1
to 1
him 1
Really 1
Does 1
it 1
not 1
strike 1
you 1
as 1
a 1
little 1
singular 1
that 1
this 1
McCarthy 1
who 1
appears 1
to 1
have 1
had 1
little 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
and 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
under 1
such 1
obligations 1
to 1
Turner 1
should 1
still 1
talk 1
of 1
marrying 1
his 1
son 1
to 1
Turner 1
s 1
daughter 1
who 1
is 1
presumably 1
heiress 1
to 1
the 1
estate 1
and 1
that 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
very 1
cocksure 1
manner 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
merely 1
a 1
case 1
of 1
a 1
proposal 1
and 1
all 1
else 1
would 1
follow 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
more 1
strange 1
since 1
we 1
know 1
that 1
Turner 1
himself 1
was 1
averse 1
to 1
the 1
idea 1
The 1
daughter 1
told 1
us 1
as 1
much 1
Do 1
you 1
not 1
deduce 1
something 1
from 1
that 1
We 1
have 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
deductions 1
and 1
the 1
inferences 1
said 1
Lestrade 1
winking 1
at 1
me 1
I 1
find 1
it 1
hard 1
enough 1
to 1
tackle 1
facts 1
Holmes 1
without 1
flying 1
away 1
after 1
theories 1
and 1
fancies 1
You 1
are 1
right 1
said 1
Holmes 1
demurely 1
you 1
do 1
find 1
it 1
very 1
hard 1
to 1
tackle 1
the 1
facts 1
Anyhow 1
I 1
have 1
grasped 1
one 1
fact 1
which 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
find 1
it 1
difficult 1
to 1
get 1
hold 1
of 1
replied 1
Lestrade 1
with 1
some 1
warmth 1
And 1
that 1
is 1
That 1
McCarthy 1
senior 1
met 1
his 1
death 1
from 1
McCarthy 1
junior 1
and 1
that 1
all 1
theories 1
to 1
the 1
contrary 1
are 1
the 1
merest 1
moonshine 1
Well 1
moonshine 1
is 1
a 1
brighter 1
thing 1
than 1
fog 1
said 1
Holmes 1
laughing 1
But 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
much 1
mistaken 1
if 1
this 1
is 1
not 1
Hatherley 1
Farm 1
upon 1
the 1
left 1
Yes 1
that 1
is 1
it 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
widespread 1
comfortable 1
looking 1
building 1
two 1
storied 1
slate 1
roofed 1
with 1
great 1
yellow 1
blotches 1
of 1
lichen 1
upon 1
the 1
grey 1
walls 1
The 1
drawn 1
blinds 1
and 1
the 1
smokeless 1
chimneys 1
however 1
gave 1
it 1
a 1
stricken 1
look 1
as 1
though 1
the 1
weight 1
of 1
this 1
horror 1
still 1
lay 1
heavy 1
upon 1
it 1
We 1
called 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
when 1
the 1
maid 1
at 1
Holmes 1
request 1
showed 1
us 1
the 1
boots 1
which 1
her 1
master 1
wore 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
his 1
death 1
and 1
also 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
the 1
son 1
s 1
though 1
not 1
the 1
pair 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
then 1
had 1
Having 1
measured 1
these 1
very 1
carefully 1
from 1
seven 1
or 1
eight 1
different 1
points 1
Holmes 1
desired 1
to 1
be 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
court 1
yard 1
from 1
which 1
we 1
all 1
followed 1
the 1
winding 1
track 1
which 1
led 1
to 1
Boscombe 1
Pool 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
was 1
transformed 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
hot 1
upon 1
such 1
a 1
scent 1
as 1
this 1
Men 1
who 1
had 1
only 1
known 1
the 1
quiet 1
thinker 1
and 1
logician 1
of 1
Baker 1
Street 1
would 1
have 1
failed 1
to 1
recognise 1
him 1
His 1
face 1
flushed 1
and 1
darkened 1
His 1
brows 1
were 1
drawn 1
into 1
two 1
hard 1
black 1
lines 1
while 1
his 1
eyes 1
shone 1
out 1
from 1
beneath 1
them 1
with 1
a 1
steely 1
glitter 1
His 1
face 1
was 1
bent 1
downward 1
his 1
shoulders 1
bowed 1
his 1
lips 1
compressed 1
and 1
the 1
veins 1
stood 1
out 1
like 1
whipcord 1
in 1
his 1
long 1
sinewy 1
neck 1
His 1
nostrils 1
seemed 1
to 1
dilate 1
with 1
a 1
purely 1
animal 1
lust 1
for 1
the 1
chase 1
and 1
his 1
mind 1
was 1
so 1
absolutely 1
concentrated 1
upon 1
the 1
matter 1
before 1
him 1
that 1
a 1
question 1
or 1
remark 1
fell 1
unheeded 1
upon 1
his 1
ears 1
or 1
at 1
the 1
most 1
only 1
provoked 1
a 1
quick 1
impatient 1
snarl 1
in 1
reply 1
Swiftly 1
and 1
silently 1
he 1
made 1
his 1
way 1
along 1
the 1
track 1
which 1
ran 1
through 1
the 1
meadows 1
and 1
so 1
by 1
way 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
to 1
the 1
Boscombe 1
Pool 1
It 1
was 1
damp 1
marshy 1
ground 1
as 1
is 1
all 1
that 1
district 1
and 1
there 1
were 1
marks 1
of 1
many 1
feet 1
both 1
upon 1
the 1
path 1
and 1
amid 1
the 1
short 1
grass 1
which 1
bounded 1
it 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
Sometimes 1
Holmes 1
would 1
hurry 1
on 1
sometimes 1
stop 1
dead 1
and 1
once 1
he 1
made 1
quite 1
a 1
little 1
detour 1
into 1
the 1
meadow 1
Lestrade 1
and 1
I 1
walked 1
behind 1
him 1
the 1
detective 1
indifferent 1
and 1
contemptuous 1
while 1
I 1
watched 1
my 1
friend 1
with 1
the 1
interest 1
which 1
sprang 1
from 1
the 1
conviction 1
that 1
every 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
actions 1
was 1
directed 1
towards 1
a 1
definite 1
end 1
The 1
Boscombe 1
Pool 1
which 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
reed 1
girt 1
sheet 1
of 1
water 1
some 1
fifty 1
yards 1
across 1
is 1
situated 1
at 1
the 1
boundary 1
between 1
the 1
Hatherley 1
Farm 1
and 1
the 1
private 1
park 1
of 1
the 1
wealthy 1
Mr 1
Turner 1
Above 1
the 1
woods 1
which 1
lined 1
it 1
upon 1
the 1
farther 1
side 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
red 1
jutting 1
pinnacles 1
which 1
marked 1
the 1
site 1
of 1
the 1
rich 1
landowner 1
s 1
dwelling 1
On 1
the 1
Hatherley 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
pool 1
the 1
woods 1
grew 1
very 1
thick 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
narrow 1
belt 1
of 1
sodden 1
grass 1
twenty 1
paces 1
across 1
between 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
the 1
reeds 1
which 1
lined 1
the 1
lake 1
Lestrade 1
showed 1
us 1
the 1
exact 1
spot 1
at 1
which 1
the 1
body 1
had 1
been 1
found 1
and 1
indeed 1
so 1
moist 1
was 1
the 1
ground 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
plainly 1
see 1
the 1
traces 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
left 1
by 1
the 1
fall 1
of 1
the 1
stricken 1
man 1
To 1
Holmes 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
by 1
his 1
eager 1
face 1
and 1
peering 1
eyes 1
very 1
many 1
other 1
things 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
read 1
upon 1
the 1
trampled 1
grass 1
He 1
ran 1
round 1
like 1
a 1
dog 1
who 1
is 1
picking 1
up 1
a 1
scent 1
and 1
then 1
turned 1
upon 1
my 1
companion 1
What 1
did 1
you 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
pool 1
for 1
he 1
asked 1
I 1
fished 1
about 1
with 1
a 1
rake 1
I 1
thought 1
there 1
might 1
be 1
some 1
weapon 1
or 1
other 1
trace 1
But 1
how 1
on 1
earth 1
Oh 1
tut 2
I 1
have 1
no 1
time 1
That 1
left 1
foot 1
of 1
yours 1
with 1
its 1
inward 1
twist 1
is 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
place 1
A 1
mole 1
could 1
trace 1
it 1
and 1
there 1
it 1
vanishes 1
among 1
the 1
reeds 1
Oh 1
how 1
simple 1
it 1
would 1
all 1
have 1
been 1
had 1
I 1
been 1
here 1
before 1
they 1
came 1
like 1
a 1
herd 1
of 1
buffalo 1
and 1
wallowed 1
all 1
over 1
it 1
Here 1
is 1
where 1
the 1
party 1
with 1
the 1
lodge 1
keeper 1
came 1
and 1
they 1
have 1
covered 1
all 1
tracks 1
for 1
six 1
or 1
eight 1
feet 1
round 1
the 1
body 1
But 1
here 1
are 1
three 1
separate 1
tracks 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
feet 1
He 1
drew 1
out 1
a 1
lens 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
upon 1
his 1
waterproof 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
better 1
view 1
talking 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
rather 1
to 1
himself 1
than 1
to 1
us 1
These 1
are 1
young 1
McCarthy 1
s 1
feet 1
Twice 1
he 1
was 1
walking 1
and 1
once 1
he 1
ran 1
swiftly 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
soles 1
are 1
deeply 1
marked 1
and 1
the 1
heels 1
hardly 1
visible 1
That 1
bears 1
out 1
his 1
story 1
He 1
ran 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
his 1
father 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
Then 1
here 1
are 1
the 1
father 1
s 1
feet 1
as 1
he 1
paced 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
What 1
is 1
this 1
then 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
butt 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
gun 1
as 1
the 1
son 1
stood 1
listening 1
And 1
this 1
Ha 1
ha 1
What 1
have 1
we 1
here 1
Tiptoes 1
tiptoes 1
Square 1
too 1
quite 1
unusual 1
boots 1
They 1
come 1
they 1
go 1
they 1
come 1
again 1
of 1
course 1
that 1
was 1
for 1
the 1
cloak 1
Now 1
where 1
did 1
they 1
come 1
from 1
He 1
ran 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
sometimes 1
losing 1
sometimes 1
finding 1
the 1
track 1
until 1
we 1
were 1
well 1
within 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
and 1
under 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
a 1
great 1
beech 1
the 1
largest 1
tree 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
Holmes 1
traced 1
his 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
farther 1
side 1
of 1
this 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
once 1
more 1
upon 1
his 1
face 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
cry 1
of 1
satisfaction 1
For 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
he 1
remained 1
there 1
turning 1
over 1
the 1
leaves 1
and 1
dried 1
sticks 1
gathering 1
up 1
what 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
dust 1
into 1
an 1
envelope 1
and 1
examining 1
with 1
his 1
lens 1
not 1
only 1
the 1
ground 1
but 1
even 1
the 1
bark 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
reach 1
A 1
jagged 1
stone 1
was 1
lying 1
among 1
the 1
moss 1
and 1
this 1
also 1
he 1
carefully 1
examined 1
and 1
retained 1
Then 1
he 1
followed 1
a 1
pathway 1
through 1
the 1
wood 1
until 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
highroad 1
where 1
all 1
traces 1
were 1
lost 1
It 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
case 1
of 1
considerable 1
interest 1
he 1
remarked 1
returning 1
to 1
his 1
natural 1
manner 1
I 1
fancy 1
that 1
this 1
grey 1
house 1
on 1
the 1
right 1
must 1
be 1
the 1
lodge 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
will 1
go 1
in 1
and 1
have 1
a 1
word 1
with 1
Moran 1
and 1
perhaps 1
write 1
a 1
little 1
note 1
Having 1
done 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
drive 1
back 1
to 1
our 1
luncheon 1
You 1
may 1
walk 1
to 1
the 1
cab 1
and 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
presently 1
It 1
was 1
about 1
ten 1
minutes 1
before 1
we 1
regained 1
our 1
cab 1
and 1
drove 1
back 1
into 1
Ross 1
Holmes 1
still 1
carrying 1
with 1
him 1
the 1
stone 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
picked 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
This 1
may 1
interest 1
you 1
Lestrade 1
he 1
remarked 1
holding 1
it 1
out 1
The 1
murder 1
was 1
done 1
with 1
it 1
I 1
see 1
no 1
marks 1
There 1
are 1
none 1
How 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
then 1
The 1
grass 1
was 1
growing 1
under 1
it 1
It 1
had 1
only 1
lain 1
there 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
a 1
place 1
whence 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
taken 1
It 1
corresponds 1
with 1
the 1
injuries 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
any 1
other 1
weapon 1
And 1
the 1
murderer 1
Is 1
a 1
tall 1
man 1
left 1
handed 1
limps 1
with 1
the 1
right 1
leg 1
wears 1
thick 1
soled 1
shooting 1
boots 1
and 1
a 1
grey 1
cloak 1
smokes 1
Indian 1
cigars 1
uses 1
a 1
cigar 1
holder 1
and 1
carries 1
a 1
blunt 1
pen 1
knife 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
There 1
are 1
several 1
other 1
indications 1
but 1
these 1
may 1
be 1
enough 1
to 1
aid 1
us 1
in 1
our 1
search 1
Lestrade 1
laughed 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
still 1
a 1
sceptic 1
he 1
said 1
Theories 1
are 1
all 1
very 1
well 1
but 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
deal 1
with 1
a 1
hard 1
headed 1
British 1
jury 1
Nous 1
verrons 1
answered 1
Holmes 1
calmly 1
You 1
work 1
your 1
own 1
method 1
and 1
I 1
shall 1
work 1
mine 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
busy 1
this 1
afternoon 1
and 1
shall 1
probably 1
return 1
to 1
London 1
by 1
the 1
evening 1
train 1
And 1
leave 1
your 1
case 1
unfinished 1
No 1
finished 1
But 1
the 1
mystery 1
It 1
is 1
solved 1
Who 1
was 1
the 1
criminal 1
then 1
The 1
gentleman 1
I 1
describe 1
But 1
who 1
is 1
he 1
Surely 1
it 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
difficult 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
This 1
is 1
not 1
such 1
a 1
populous 1
neighbourhood 1
Lestrade 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
practical 1
man 1
he 1
said 1
and 1
I 1
really 1
cannot 1
undertake 1
to 1
go 1
about 1
the 1
country 1
looking 1
for 1
a 1
left 1
handed 1
gentleman 1
with 1
a 1
game 1
leg 1
I 1
should 1
become 1
the 1
laughing 1
stock 1
of 1
Scotland 1
Yard 1
All 1
right 1
said 1
Holmes 1
quietly 1
I 1
have 1
given 1
you 1
the 1
chance 1
Here 1
are 1
your 1
lodgings 1
Good 1
bye 1
I 1
shall 1
drop 1
you 1
a 1
line 1
before 1
I 1
leave 1
Having 1
left 1
Lestrade 1
at 1
his 1
rooms 1
we 1
drove 1
to 1
our 1
hotel 1
where 1
we 1
found 1
lunch 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
Holmes 1
was 1
silent 1
and 1
buried 1
in 1
thought 1
with 1
a 1
pained 1
expression 1
upon 1
his 1
face 1
as 1
one 1
who 1
finds 1
himself 1
in 1
a 1
perplexing 1
position 1
Look 1
here 1
Watson 1
he 1
said 1
when 1
the 1
cloth 1
was 1
cleared 1
just 1
sit 1
down 1
in 1
this 1
chair 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
preach 1
to 1
you 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
quite 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
I 1
should 1
value 1
your 1
advice 1
Light 1
a 1
cigar 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
expound 1
Pray 1
do 1
so 1
Well 1
now 1
in 1
considering 1
this 1
case 1
there 1
are 1
two 1
points 1
about 1
young 1
McCarthy 1
s 1
narrative 1
which 1
struck 1
us 1
both 1
instantly 1
although 1
they 1
impressed 1
me 1
in 1
his 1
favour 1
and 1
you 1
against 1
him 1
One 1
was 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
his 1
father 1
should 1
according 1
to 1
his 1
account 1
cry 1
Cooee 1
before 1
seeing 1
him 1
The 1
other 1
was 1
his 1
singular 1
dying 1
reference 1
to 1
a 1
rat 1
He 1
mumbled 1
several 1
words 1
you 1
understand 1
but 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
that 1
caught 1
the 1
son 1
s 1
ear 1
Now 1
from 1
this 1
double 1
point 1
our 1
research 1
must 1
commence 1
and 1
we 1
will 1
begin 1
it 1
by 1
presuming 1
that 1
what 1
the 1
lad 1
says 1
is 1
absolutely 1
true 1
What 1
of 1
this 1
Cooee 1
then 1
Well 1
obviously 1
it 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
meant 1
for 1
the 1
son 1
The 1
son 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
he 1
knew 1
was 1
in 1
Bristol 1
It 1
was 1
mere 1
chance 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
within 1
earshot 1
The 1
Cooee 1
was 1
meant 1
to 1
attract 1
the 1
attention 1
of 1
whoever 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
appointment 1
with 1
But 1
Cooee 1
is 1
a 1
distinctly 1
Australian 1
cry 1
and 1
one 1
which 1
is 1
used 1
between 1
Australians 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
strong 1
presumption 1
that 1
the 1
person 1
whom 1
McCarthy 1
expected 1
to 1
meet 1
him 1
at 1
Boscombe 1
Pool 1
was 1
someone 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
Australia 1
What 1
of 1
the 1
rat 1
then 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
took 1
a 1
folded 1
paper 1
from 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
flattened 1
it 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
This 1
is 1
a 1
map 1
of 1
the 1
Colony 1
of 1
Victoria 1
he 1
said 1
I 1
wired 1
to 1
Bristol 1
for 1
it 1
last 1
night 1
He 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
over 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
map 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
read 1
ARAT 1
I 1
read 1
And 1
now 1
He 1
raised 1
his 1
hand 1
BALLARAT 1
Quite 1
so 1
That 1
was 1
the 1
word 1
the 1
man 1
uttered 1
and 1
of 1
which 1
his 1
son 1
only 1
caught 1
the 1
last 1
two 1
syllables 1
He 1
was 1
trying 1
to 1
utter 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
his 1
murderer 1
So 1
and 1
so 1
of 1
Ballarat 1
It 1
is 1
wonderful 1
I 1
exclaimed 1
It 1
is 1
obvious 1
And 1
now 1
you 1
see 1
I 1
had 1
narrowed 1
the 1
field 1
down 1
considerably 1
The 1
possession 1
of 1
a 1
grey 1
garment 1
was 1
a 1
third 1
point 1
which 1
granting 1
the 1
son 1
s 1
statement 1
to 1
be 1
correct 1
was 1
a 1
certainty 1
We 1
have 1
come 1
now 1
out 1
of 1
mere 1
vagueness 1
to 1
the 1
definite 1
conception 1
of 1
an 1
Australian 1
from 1
Ballarat 1
with 1
a 1
grey 1
cloak 1
Certainly 1
And 1
one 1
who 1
was 1
at 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
district 1
for 1
the 1
pool 1
can 1
only 1
be 1
approached 1
by 1
the 1
farm 1
or 1
by 1
the 1
estate 1
where 1
strangers 1
could 1
hardly 1
wander 1
Quite 1
so 1
Then 1
comes 1
our 1
expedition 1
of 1
to 1
day 1
By 1
an 1
examination 1
of 1
the 1
ground 1
I 1
gained 1
the 1
trifling 1
details 1
which 1
I 1
gave 1
to 1
that 1
imbecile 1
Lestrade 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
personality 1
of 1
the 1
criminal 1
But 1
how 1
did 1
you 1
gain 1
them 1
You 1
know 1
my 1
method 1
It 1
is 1
founded 1
upon 1
the 1
observation 1
of 1
trifles 1
His 1
height 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
you 1
might 1
roughly 1
judge 1
from 1
the 1
length 1
of 1
his 1
stride 1
His 1
boots 1
too 1
might 1
be 1
told 1
from 1
their 1
traces 1
Yes 1
they 1
were 1
peculiar 1
boots 1
But 1
his 1
lameness 1
The 1
impression 1
of 1
his 1
right 1
foot 1
was 1
always 1
less 1
distinct 1
than 1
his 1
left 1
He 1
put 1
less 1
weight 1
upon 1
it 1
Why 1
Because 1
he 1
limped 1
he 1
was 1
lame 1
But 1
his 1
left 1
handedness 1
You 1
were 1
yourself 1
struck 1
by 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
injury 1
as 1
recorded 1
by 1
the 1
surgeon 1
at 1
the 1
inquest 1
The 1
blow 1
was 1
struck 1
from 1
immediately 1
behind 1
and 1
yet 1
was 1
upon 1
the 1
left 1
side 1
Now 1
how 1
can 1
that 1
be 1
unless 1
it 1
were 1
by 1
a 1
left 1
handed 1
man 1
He 1
had 1
stood 1
behind 1
that 1
tree 1
during 1
the 1
interview 1
between 1
the 1
father 1
and 1
son 1
He 1
had 1
even 1
smoked 1
there 1
I 1
found 1
the 1
ash 1
of 1
a 1
cigar 1
which 1
my 1
special 1
knowledge 1
of 1
tobacco 1
ashes 1
enables 1
me 1
to 1
pronounce 1
as 1
an 1
Indian 1
cigar 1
I 1
have 1
as 1
you 1
know 1
devoted 1
some 1
attention 1
to 1
this 1
and 1
written 1
a 1
little 1
monograph 1
on 1
the 1
ashes 1
of 1
different 1
varieties 1
of 1
pipe 1
cigar 1
and 1
cigarette 1
tobacco 1
Having 1
found 1
the 1
ash 1
I 1
then 1
looked 1
round 1
and 1
discovered 1
the 1
stump 1
among 1
the 1
moss 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
tossed 1
it 1
It 1
was 1
an 1
Indian 1
cigar 1
of 1
the 1
variety 1
which 1
are 1
rolled 1
in 1
Rotterdam 1
And 1
the 1
cigar 1
holder 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
end 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
in 1
his 1
mouth 1
Therefore 1
he 1
used 1
a 1
holder 1
The 1
tip 1
had 1
been 1
cut 1
off 1
not 1
bitten 1
off 1
but 1
the 1
cut 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
clean 1
one 1
so 1
I 1
deduced 1
a 1
blunt 1
pen 1
knife 1
Holmes 1
I 1
said 1
you 1
have 1
drawn 1
a 1
net 1
round 1
this 1
man 1
from 1
which 1
he 1
cannot 1
escape 1
and 1
you 1
have 1
saved 1
an 1
innocent 1
human 1
life 1
as 1
truly 1
as 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
cut 1
the 1
cord 1
which 1
was 1
hanging 1
him 1
I 1
see 1
the 1
direction 1
in 1
which 1
all 1
this 1
points 1
The 1
culprit 1
is 1
Mr 1
John 1
Turner 1
cried 1
the 1
hotel 1
waiter 1
opening 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
our 1
sitting 1
room 1
and 1
ushering 1
in 1
a 1
visitor 1
The 1
man 1
who 1
entered 1
was 1
a 1
strange 1
and 1
impressive 1
figure 1
His 1
slow 1
limping 1
step 1
and 1
bowed 1
shoulders 1
gave 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
decrepitude 1
and 1
yet 1
his 1
hard 1
deep 1
lined 1
craggy 1
features 1
and 1
his 1
enormous 1
limbs 1
showed 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
possessed 1
of 1
unusual 1
strength 1
of 1
body 1
and 1
of 1
character 1
His 1
tangled 1
beard 1
grizzled 1
hair 1
and 1
outstanding 1
drooping 1
eyebrows 1
combined 1
to 1
give 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
dignity 1
and 1
power 1
to 1
his 1
appearance 1
but 1
his 1
face 1
was 1
of 1
an 1
ashen 1
white 1
while 1
his 1
lips 1
and 1
the 1
corners 1
of 1
his 1
nostrils 1
were 1
tinged 1
with 1
a 1
shade 1
of 1
blue 1
It 1
was 1
clear 1
to 1
me 1
at 1
a 1
glance 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
grip 1
of 1
some 1
deadly 1
and 1
chronic 1
disease 1
Pray 1
sit 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
sofa 1
said 1
Holmes 1
gently 1
You 1
had 1
my 1
note 1
Yes 1
the 1
lodge 1
keeper 1
brought 1
it 1
up 1
You 1
said 1
that 1
you 1
wished 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
here 1
to 1
avoid 1
scandal 1
I 1
thought 1
people 1
would 1
talk 1
if 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
Hall 1
And 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
wish 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
He 1
looked 1
across 1
at 1
my 1
companion 1
with 1
despair 1
in 1
his 1
weary 1
eyes 1
as 1
though 1
his 1
question 1
was 1
already 1
answered 1
Yes 1
said 1
Holmes 1
answering 1
the 1
look 1
rather 1
than 1
the 1
words 1
It 1
is 1
so 1
I 1
know 1
all 1
about 1
McCarthy 1
The 1
old 1
man 1
sank 1
his 1
face 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
God 1
help 1
me 1
he 1
cried 1
But 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
let 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
come 1
to 1
harm 1
I 1
give 1
you 1
my 1
word 1
that 1
I 1
would 1
have 1
spoken 1
out 1
if 1
it 1
went 1
against 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
Assizes 1
I 1
am 1
glad 1
to 1
hear 1
you 1
say 1
so 1
said 1
Holmes 1
gravely 1
I 1
would 1
have 1
spoken 1
now 1
had 1
it 1
not 1
been 1
for 1
my 1
dear 1
girl 1
It 1
would 1
break 1
her 1
heart 1
it 1
will 1
break 1
her 1
heart 1
when 1
she 1
hears 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
arrested 1
It 1
may 1
not 1
come 1
to 1
that 1
said 1
Holmes 1
What 1
I 1
am 1
no 1
official 1
agent 1
I 1
understand 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
your 1
daughter 1
who 1
required 1
my 1
presence 1
here 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
acting 1
in 1
her 1
interests 1
Young 1
McCarthy 1
must 1
be 1
got 1
off 1
however 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
dying 1
man 1
said 1
old 1
Turner 1
I 1
have 1
had 1
diabetes 1
for 1
years 1
My 1
doctor 1
says 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
question 1
whether 1
I 1
shall 1
live 1
a 1
month 1
Yet 1
I 1
would 1
rather 1
die 1
under 1
my 1
own 1
roof 1
than 1
in 1
a 1
gaol 1
Holmes 1
rose 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
with 1
his 1
pen 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
a 1
bundle 1
of 1
paper 1
before 1
him 1
Just 1
tell 1
us 1
the 1
truth 1
he 1
said 1
I 1
shall 1
jot 1
down 1
the 1
facts 1
You 1
will 1
sign 1
it 1
and 1
Watson 1
here 1
can 1
witness 1
it 1
Then 1
I 1
could 1
produce 1
your 1
confession 1
at 1
the 1
last 1
extremity 1
to 1
save 1
young 1
McCarthy 1
I 1
promise 1
you 1
that 1
I 1
shall 1
not 1
use 1
it 1
unless 1
it 1
is 1
absolutely 1
needed 1
It 1
s 1
as 1
well 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
question 1
whether 1
I 1
shall 1
live 1
to 1
the 1
Assizes 1
so 1
it 1
matters 1
little 1
to 1
me 1
but 1
I 1
should 1
wish 1
to 1
spare 1
Alice 1
the 1
shock 1
And 1
now 1
I 1
will 1
make 1
the 1
thing 1
clear 1
to 1
you 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
in 1
the 1
acting 1
but 1
will 1
not 1
take 1
me 1
long 1
to 1
tell 1
You 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
this 1
dead 1
man 1
McCarthy 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
devil 1
incarnate 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
God 1
keep 1
you 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
clutches 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
man 1
as 1
he 1
His 1
grip 1
has 1
been 1
upon 1
me 1
these 1
twenty 1
years 1
and 1
he 1
has 1
blasted 1
my 1
life 1
I 1
ll 1
tell 1
you 1
first 1
how 1
I 1
came 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
his 1
power 1
It 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
early 1
s 1
at 1
the 1
diggings 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
young 1
chap 1
then 1
hot 1
blooded 1
and 1
reckless 1
ready 1
to 1
turn 1
my 1
hand 1
at 1
anything 1
I 1
got 1
among 1
bad 1
companions 1
took 1
to 1
drink 1
had 1
no 1
luck 1
with 1
my 1
claim 1
took 1
to 1
the 1
bush 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
word 1
became 1
what 1
you 1
would 1
call 1
over 1
here 1
a 1
highway 1
robber 1
There 1
were 1
six 1
of 1
us 1
and 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
wild 1
free 1
life 1
of 1
it 1
sticking 1
up 1
a 1
station 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
or 1
stopping 1
the 1
wagons 1
on 1
the 1
road 1
to 1
the 1
diggings 1
Black 1
Jack 1
of 1
Ballarat 1
was 1
the 1
name 1
I 1
went 1
under 1
and 1
our 1
party 1
is 1
still 1
remembered 1
in 1
the 1
colony 1
as 1
the 1
Ballarat 1
Gang 1
One 1
day 1
a 1
gold 1
convoy 1
came 1
down 1
from 1
Ballarat 1
to 1
Melbourne 1
and 1
we 1
lay 1
in 1
wait 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
attacked 1
it 1
There 1
were 1
six 1
troopers 1
and 1
six 1
of 1
us 1
so 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
close 1
thing 1
but 1
we 1
emptied 1
four 1
of 1
their 1
saddles 1
at 1
the 1
first 1
volley 1
Three 1
of 1
our 1
boys 1
were 1
killed 1
however 1
before 1
we 1
got 1
the 1
swag 1
I 1
put 1
my 1
pistol 1
to 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
wagon 1
driver 1
who 1
was 1
this 1
very 1
man 1
McCarthy 1
I 1
wish 1
to 1
the 1
Lord 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
shot 1
him 1
then 1
but 1
I 1
spared 1
him 1
though 1
I 1
saw 1
his 1
wicked 1
little 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
on 1
my 1
face 1
as 1
though 1
to 1
remember 1
every 1
feature 1
We 1
got 1
away 1
with 1
the 1
gold 1
became 1
wealthy 1
men 1
and 1
made 1
our 1
way 1
over 1
to 1
England 1
without 1
being 1
suspected 1
There 1
I 1
parted 1
from 1
my 1
old 1
pals 1
and 1
determined 1
to 1
settle 1
down 1
to 1
a 1
quiet 1
and 1
respectable 1
life 1
I 1
bought 1
this 1
estate 1
which 1
chanced 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
market 1
and 1
I 1
set 1
myself 1
to 1
do 1
a 1
little 1
good 1
with 1
my 1
money 1
to 1
make 1
up 1
for 1
the 1
way 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
earned 1
it 1
I 1
married 1
too 1
and 1
though 1
my 1
wife 1
died 1
young 1
she 1
left 1
me 1
my 1
dear 1
little 1
Alice 1
Even 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
just 1
a 1
baby 1
her 1
wee 1
hand 1
seemed 1
to 1
lead 1
me 1
down 1
the 1
right 1
path 1
as 1
nothing 1
else 1
had 1
ever 1
done 1
In 1
a 1
word 1
I 1
turned 1
over 1
a 1
new 1
leaf 1
and 1
did 1
my 1
best 1
to 1
make 1
up 1
for 1
the 1
past 1
All 1
was 1
going 1
well 1
when 1
McCarthy 1
laid 1
his 1
grip 1
upon 1
me 1
I 1
had 1
gone 1
up 1
to 1
town 1
about 1
an 1
investment 1
and 1
I 1
met 1
him 1
in 1
Regent 1
Street 1
with 1
hardly 1
a 1
coat 1
to 1
his 1
back 1
or 1
a 1
boot 1
to 1
his 1
foot 1
Here 1
we 1
are 1
Jack 1
says 1
he 1
touching 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
arm 1
we 1
ll 1
be 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
a 1
family 1
to 1
you 1
There 1
s 1
two 1
of 1
us 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
son 1
and 1
you 1
can 1
have 1
the 1
keeping 1
of 1
us 1
If 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
fine 1
law 1
abiding 1
country 1
is 1
England 1
and 1
there 1
s 1
always 1
a 1
policeman 1
within 1
hail 1
Well 1
down 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
west 1
country 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
shaking 1
them 1
off 1
and 1
there 1
they 1
have 1
lived 1
rent 1
free 1
on 1
my 1
best 1
land 1
ever 1
since 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
rest 1
for 1
me 1
no 1
peace 1
no 1
forgetfulness 1
turn 1
where 1
I 1
would 1
there 1
was 1
his 1
cunning 1
grinning 1
face 1
at 1
my 1
elbow 1
It 1
grew 1
worse 1
as 1
Alice 1
grew 1
up 1
for 1
he 1
soon 1
saw 1
I 1
was 1
more 1
afraid 1
of 1
her 1
knowing 1
my 1
past 1
than 1
of 1
the 1
police 1
Whatever 1
he 1
wanted 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
and 1
whatever 1
it 1
was 1
I 1
gave 1
him 1
without 1
question 1
land 1
money 1
houses 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
asked 1
a 1
thing 1
which 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
give 1
He 1
asked 1
for 1
Alice 1
His 1
son 1
you 1
see 1
had 1
grown 1
up 1
and 1
so 1
had 1
my 1
girl 1
and 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
known 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
weak 1
health 1
it 1
seemed 1
a 1
fine 1
stroke 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
his 1
lad 1
should 1
step 1
into 1
the 1
whole 1
property 1
But 1
there 1
I 1
was 1
firm 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
his 1
cursed 1
stock 1
mixed 1
with 1
mine 1
not 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
any 1
dislike 1
to 1
the 1
lad 1
but 1
his 1
blood 1
was 1
in 1
him 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
enough 1
I 1
stood 1
firm 1
McCarthy 1
threatened 1
I 1
braved 1
him 1
to 1
do 1
his 1
worst 1
We 1
were 1
to 1
meet 1
at 1
the 1
pool 1
midway 1
between 1
our 1
houses 1
to 1
talk 1
it 1
over 1
When 1
I 1
went 1
down 1
there 1
I 1
found 1
him 1
talking 1
with 1
his 1
son 1
so 1
I 1
smoked 1
a 1
cigar 1
and 1
waited 1
behind 1
a 1
tree 1
until 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
alone 1
But 1
as 1
I 1
listened 1
to 1
his 1
talk 1
all 1
that 1
was 1
black 1
and 1
bitter 1
in 1
me 1
seemed 1
to 1
come 1
uppermost 1
He 1
was 1
urging 1
his 1
son 1
to 1
marry 1
my 1
daughter 1
with 1
as 1
little 1
regard 1
for 1
what 1
she 1
might 1
think 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
were 1
a 1
slut 1
from 1
off 1
the 1
streets 1
It 1
drove 1
me 1
mad 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
and 1
all 1
that 1
I 1
held 1
most 1
dear 1
should 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
man 1
as 1
this 1
Could 1
I 1
not 1
snap 1
the 1
bond 1
I 1
was 1
already 1
a 1
dying 1
and 1
a 1
desperate 1
man 1
Though 1
clear 1
of 1
mind 1
and 1
fairly 1
strong 1
of 1
limb 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
my 1
own 1
fate 1
was 1
sealed 1
But 1
my 1
memory 1
and 1
my 1
girl 1
Both 1
could 1
be 1
saved 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
but 1
silence 1
that 1
foul 1
tongue 1
I 1
did 1
it 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
I 1
would 1
do 1
it 1
again 1
Deeply 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
sinned 1
I 1
have 1
led 1
a 1
life 1
of 1
martyrdom 1
to 1
atone 1
for 1
it 1
But 1
that 1
my 1
girl 1
should 1
be 1
entangled 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
meshes 1
which 1
held 1
me 1
was 1
more 1
than 1
I 1
could 1
suffer 1
I 1
struck 1
him 1
down 1
with 1
no 1
more 1
compunction 1
than 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
some 1
foul 1
and 1
venomous 1
beast 1
His 1
cry 1
brought 1
back 1
his 1
son 1
but 1
I 1
had 1
gained 1
the 1
cover 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
though 1
I 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
fetch 1
the 1
cloak 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
dropped 1
in 1
my 1
flight 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
true 1
story 1
gentlemen 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
occurred 1
Well 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
judge 1
you 1
said 1
Holmes 1
as 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
signed 1
the 1
statement 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
drawn 1
out 1
I 1
pray 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
never 1
be 1
exposed 1
to 1
such 1
a 1
temptation 1
I 1
pray 1
not 1
sir 1
And 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
intend 1
to 1
do 1
In 1
view 1
of 1
your 1
health 1
nothing 1
You 1
are 1
yourself 1
aware 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
soon 1
have 1
to 1
answer 1
for 1
your 1
deed 1
at 1
a 1
higher 1
court 1
than 1
the 1
Assizes 1
I 1
will 1
keep 1
your 1
confession 1
and 1
if 1
McCarthy 1
is 1
condemned 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
forced 1
to 1
use 1
it 1
If 1
not 1
it 1
shall 1
never 1
be 1
seen 1
by 1
mortal 1
eye 1
and 1
your 1
secret 1
whether 1
you 1
be 1
alive 1
or 1
dead 1
shall 1
be 1
safe 1
with 1
us 1
Farewell 1
then 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
solemnly 1
Your 1
own 1
deathbeds 1
when 1
they 1
come 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
easier 1
for 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
peace 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
given 1
to 1
mine 1
Tottering 1
and 1
shaking 1
in 1
all 1
his 1
giant 1
frame 1
he 1
stumbled 1
slowly 1
from 1
the 1
room 1
God 1
help 1
us 1
said 1
Holmes 1
after 1
a 1
long 1
silence 1
Why 1
does 1
fate 1
play 1
such 1
tricks 1
with 1
poor 1
helpless 1
worms 1
I 1
never 1
hear 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
case 1
as 1
this 1
that 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
of 1
Baxter 1
s 1
words 1
and 1
say 1
There 1
but 1
for 1
the 1
grace 1
of 1
God 1
goes 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
James 1
McCarthy 1
was 1
acquitted 1
at 1
the 1
Assizes 1
on 1
the 1
strength 1
of 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
objections 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
drawn 1
out 1
by 1
Holmes 1
and 1
submitted 1
to 1
the 1
defending 1
counsel 1
Old 1
Turner 1
lived 1
for 1
seven 1
months 1
after 1
our 1
interview 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
now 1
dead 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
every 1
prospect 1
that 1
the 1
son 1
and 1
daughter 1
may 1
come 1
to 1
live 1
happily 1
together 1
in 1
ignorance 1
of 1
the 1
black 1
cloud 1
which 1
rests 1
upon 1
their 1
past 1
ADVENTURE 1
V 1
THE 1
FIVE 1
ORANGE 1
PIPS 1
When 1
I 1
glance 1
over 1
my 1
notes 1
and 1
records 1
of 1
the 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
cases 1
between 1
the 1
years 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
faced 1
by 1
so 1
many 1
which 1
present 1
strange 1
and 1
interesting 1
features 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
easy 1
matter 1
to 1
know 1
which 1
to 1
choose 1
and 1
which 1
to 1
leave 1
Some 1
however 1
have 1
already 1
gained 1
publicity 1
through 1
the 1
papers 1
and 1
others 1
have 1
not 1
offered 1
a 1
field 1
for 1
those 1
peculiar 1
qualities 1
which 1
my 1
friend 1
possessed 1
in 1
so 1
high 1
a 1
degree 1
and 1
which 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
these 1
papers 1
to 1
illustrate 1
Some 1
too 1
have 1
baffled 1
his 1
analytical 1
skill 1
and 1
would 1
be 1
as 1
narratives 1
beginnings 1
without 1
an 1
ending 1
while 1
others 1
have 1
been 1
but 1
partially 1
cleared 1
up 1
and 1
have 1
their 1
explanations 1
founded 1
rather 1
upon 1
conjecture 1
and 1
surmise 1
than 1
on 1
that 1
absolute 1
logical 1
proof 1
which 1
was 1
so 1
dear 1
to 1
him 1
There 1
is 1
however 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
last 1
which 1
was 1
so 1
remarkable 1
in 1
its 1
details 1
and 1
so 1
startling 1
in 1
its 1
results 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
tempted 1
to 1
give 1
some 1
account 1
of 1
it 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
points 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
it 1
which 1
never 1
have 1
been 1
and 1
probably 1
never 1
will 1
be 1
entirely 1
cleared 1
up 1
The 1
year 1
furnished 1
us 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
series 1
of 1
cases 1
of 1
greater 1
or 1
less 1
interest 1
of 1
which 1
I 1
retain 1
the 1
records 1
Among 1
my 1
headings 1
under 1
this 1
one 1
twelve 1
months 1
I 1
find 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
adventure 1
of 1
the 1
Paradol 1
Chamber 1
of 1
the 1
Amateur 1
Mendicant 1
Society 1
who 1
held 1
a 1
luxurious 1
club 1
in 1
the 1
lower 1
vault 1
of 1
a 1
furniture 1
warehouse 1
of 1
the 1
facts 1
connected 1
with 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
the 1
British 1
barque 1
Sophy 1
Anderson 1
of 1
the 1
singular 1
adventures 1
of 1
the 1
Grice 1
Patersons 1
in 1
the 1
island 1
of 1
Uffa 1
and 1
finally 1
of 1
the 1
Camberwell 1
poisoning 1
case 1
In 1
the 1
latter 1
as 1
may 1
be 1
remembered 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
was 1
able 1
by 1
winding 1
up 1
the 1
dead 1
man 1
s 1
watch 1
to 1
prove 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
wound 1
up 1
two 1
hours 1
before 1
and 1
that 1
therefore 1
the 1
deceased 1
had 1
gone 1
to 1
bed 1
within 1
that 1
time 1
a 1
deduction 1
which 1
was 1
of 1
the 1
greatest 1
importance 1
in 1
clearing 1
up 1
the 1
case 1
All 1
these 1
I 1
may 1
sketch 1
out 1
at 1
some 1
future 1
date 1
but 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
present 1
such 1
singular 1
features 1
as 1
the 1
strange 1
train 1
of 1
circumstances 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
now 1
taken 1
up 1
my 1
pen 1
to 1
describe 1
It 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
latter 1
days 1
of 1
September 1
and 1
the 1
equinoctial 1
gales 1
had 1
set 1
in 1
with 1
exceptional 1
violence 1
All 1
day 1
the 1
wind 1
had 1
screamed 1
and 1
the 1
rain 1
had 1
beaten 1
against 1
the 1
windows 1
so 1
that 1
even 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
great 1
hand 1
made 1
London 1
we 1
were 1
forced 1
to 1
raise 1
our 1
minds 1
for 1
the 1
instant 1
from 1
the 1
routine 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
to 1
recognise 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
those 1
great 1
elemental 1
forces 1
which 1
shriek 1
at 1
mankind 1
through 1
the 1
bars 1
of 1
his 1
civilisation 1
like 1
untamed 1
beasts 1
in 1
a 1
cage 1
As 1
evening 1
drew 1
in 1
the 1
storm 1
grew 1
higher 1
and 1
louder 1
and 1
the 1
wind 1
cried 1
and 1
sobbed 1
like 1
a 1
child 1
in 1
the 1
chimney 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
sat 1
moodily 1
at 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
fireplace 1
cross 1
indexing 1
his 1
records 1
of 1
crime 1
while 1
I 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
was 1
deep 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
Clark 1
Russell 1
s 1
fine 1
sea 1
stories 1
until 1
the 1
howl 1
of 1
the 1
gale 1
from 1
without 1
seemed 1
to 1
blend 1
with 1
the 1
text 1
and 1
the 1
splash 1
of 1
the 1
rain 1
to 1
lengthen 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
long 1
swash 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
waves 1
My 1
wife 1
was 1
on 1
a 1
visit 1
to 1
her 1
mother 1
s 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
dweller 1
once 1
more 1
in 1
my 1
old 1
quarters 1
at 1
Baker 1
Street 1
Why 1
said 1
I 1
glancing 1
up 1
at 1
my 1
companion 1
that 1
was 1
surely 1
the 1
bell 1
Who 1
could 1
come 1
to 1
night 1
Some 1
friend 1
of 1
yours 1
perhaps 1
Except 1
yourself 1
I 1
have 1
none 1
he 1
answered 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
encourage 1
visitors 1
A 1
client 1
then 1
If 1
so 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
serious 1
case 1
Nothing 1
less 1
would 1
bring 1
a 1
man 1
out 1
on 1
such 1
a 1
day 1
and 1
at 1
such 1
an 1
hour 1
But 1
I 1
take 1
it 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
more 1
likely 1
to 1
be 1
some 1
crony 1
of 1
the 1
landlady 1
s 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
was 1
wrong 1
in 1
his 1
conjecture 1
however 1
for 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
step 1
in 1
the 1
passage 1
and 1
a 1
tapping 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
He 1
stretched 1
out 1
his 1
long 1
arm 1
to 1
turn 1
the 1
lamp 1
away 1
from 1
himself 1
and 1
towards 1
the 1
vacant 1
chair 1
upon 1
which 1
a 1
newcomer 1
must 1
sit 1
Come 1
in 1
said 1
he 1
The 1
man 1
who 1
entered 1
was 1
young 1
some 1
two 1
and 1
twenty 1
at 1
the 1
outside 1
well 1
groomed 1
and 1
trimly 1
clad 1
with 1
something 1
of 1
refinement 1
and 1
delicacy 1
in 1
his 1
bearing 1
The 1
streaming 1
umbrella 1
which 1
he 1
held 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
his 1
long 1
shining 1
waterproof 1
told 1
of 1
the 1
fierce 1
weather 1
through 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
He 1
looked 1
about 1
him 1
anxiously 1
in 1
the 1
glare 1
of 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
his 1
face 1
was 1
pale 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
heavy 1
like 1
those 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
weighed 1
down 1
with 1
some 1
great 1
anxiety 1
I 1
owe 1
you 1
an 1
apology 1
he 1
said 1
raising 1
his 1
golden 1
pince 1
nez 1
to 1
his 1
eyes 1
I 1
trust 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
intruding 1
I 1
fear 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
brought 1
some 1
traces 1
of 1
the 1
storm 1
and 1
rain 1
into 1
your 1
snug 1
chamber 1
Give 1
me 1
your 1
coat 1
and 1
umbrella 1
said 1
Holmes 1
They 1
may 1
rest 1
here 1
on 1
the 1
hook 1
and 1
will 1
be 1
dry 1
presently 1
You 1
have 1
come 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
south 1
west 1
I 1
see 1
Yes 1
from 1
Horsham 1
That 1
clay 1
and 1
chalk 1
mixture 1
which 1
I 1
see 1
upon 1
your 1
toe 1
caps 1
is 1
quite 1
distinctive 1
I 1
have 1
come 1
for 1
advice 1
That 1
is 1
easily 1
got 1
And 1
help 1
That 1
is 1
not 1
always 1
so 1
easy 1
I 1
have 1
heard 1
of 1
you 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
I 1
heard 1
from 1
Major 1
Prendergast 1
how 1
you 1
saved 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
Tankerville 1
Club 1
scandal 1
Ah 1
of 1
course 1
He 1
was 1
wrongfully 1
accused 1
of 1
cheating 1
at 1
cards 1
He 1
said 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
solve 1
anything 1
He 1
said 1
too 1
much 1
That 1
you 1
are 1
never 1
beaten 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
beaten 1
four 1
times 1
three 1
times 1
by 1
men 1
and 1
once 1
by 1
a 1
woman 1
But 1
what 1
is 1
that 1
compared 1
with 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
your 1
successes 1
It 1
is 1
true 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
generally 1
successful 1
Then 1
you 1
may 1
be 1
so 1
with 1
me 1
I 1
beg 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
draw 1
your 1
chair 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
favour 1
me 1
with 1
some 1
details 1
as 1
to 1
your 1
case 1
It 1
is 1
no 1
ordinary 1
one 1
None 1
of 1
those 1
which 1
come 1
to 1
me 1
are 1
I 1
am 1
the 1
last 1
court 1
of 1
appeal 1
And 1
yet 1
I 1
question 1
sir 1
whether 1
in 1
all 1
your 1
experience 1
you 1
have 1
ever 1
listened 1
to 1
a 1
more 1
mysterious 1
and 1
inexplicable 1
chain 1
of 1
events 1
than 1
those 1
which 1
have 1
happened 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
family 1
You 1
fill 1
me 1
with 1
interest 1
said 1
Holmes 1
Pray 1
give 1
us 1
the 1
essential 1
facts 1
from 1
the 1
commencement 1
and 1
I 1
can 1
afterwards 1
question 1
you 1
as 1
to 1
those 1
details 1
which 1
seem 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
most 1
important 1
The 1
young 1
man 1
pulled 1
his 1
chair 1
up 1
and 1
pushed 1
his 1
wet 1
feet 1
out 1
towards 1
the 1
blaze 1
My 1
name 1
said 1
he 1
is 1
John 1
Openshaw 1
but 1
my 1
own 1
affairs 1
have 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
I 1
can 1
understand 1
little 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
this 1
awful 1
business 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
hereditary 1
matter 1
so 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
give 1
you 1
an 1
idea 1
of 1
the 1
facts 1
I 1
must 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
commencement 1
of 1
the 1
affair 1
You 1
must 1
know 1
that 1
my 1
grandfather 1
had 1
two 1
sons 1
my 1
uncle 1
Elias 1
and 1
my 1
father 1
Joseph 1
My 1
father 1
had 1
a 1
small 1
factory 1
at 1
Coventry 1
which 1
he 1
enlarged 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
the 1
invention 1
of 1
bicycling 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
patentee 1
of 1
the 1
Openshaw 1
unbreakable 1
tire 1
and 1
his 1
business 1
met 1
with 1
such 1
success 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
sell 1
it 1
and 1
to 1
retire 1
upon 1
a 1
handsome 1
competence 1
My 1
uncle 1
Elias 1
emigrated 1
to 1
America 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
young 1
man 1
and 1
became 1
a 1
planter 1
in 1
Florida 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
reported 1
to 1
have 1
done 1
very 1
well 1
At 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
the 1
war 1
he 1
fought 1
in 1
Jackson 1
s 1
army 1
and 1
afterwards 1
under 1
Hood 1
where 1
he 1
rose 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
colonel 1
When 1
Lee 1
laid 1
down 1
his 1
arms 1
my 1
uncle 1
returned 1
to 1
his 1
plantation 1
where 1
he 1
remained 1
for 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
years 1
About 1
or 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
Europe 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
small 1
estate 1
in 1
Sussex 1
near 1
Horsham 1
He 1
had 1
made 1
a 1
very 1
considerable 1
fortune 1
in 1
the 1
States 1
and 1
his 1
reason 1
for 1
leaving 1
them 1
was 1
his 1
aversion 1
to 1
the 1
negroes 1
and 1
his 1
dislike 1
of 1
the 1
Republican 1
policy 1
in 1
extending 1
the 1
franchise 1
to 1
them 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
singular 1
man 1
fierce 1
and 1
quick 1
tempered 1
very 1
foul 1
mouthed 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
angry 1
and 1
of 1
a 1
most 1
retiring 1
disposition 1
During 1
all 1
the 1
years 1
that 1
he 1
lived 1
at 1
Horsham 1
I 1
doubt 1
if 1
ever 1
he 1
set 1
foot 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
He 1
had 1
a 1
garden 1
and 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
fields 1
round 1
his 1
house 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
would 1
take 1
his 1
exercise 1
though 1
very 1
often 1
for 1
weeks 1
on 1
end 1
he 1
would 1
never 1
leave 1
his 1
room 1
He 1
drank 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
brandy 1
and 1
smoked 1
very 1
heavily 1
but 1
he 1
would 1
see 1
no 1
society 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
any 1
friends 1
not 1
even 1
his 1
own 1
brother 1
He 1
didn 1
t 1
mind 1
me 1
in 1
fact 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
fancy 1
to 1
me 1
for 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
me 1
first 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
youngster 1
of 1
twelve 1
or 1
so 1
This 1
would 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
year 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
eight 1
or 1
nine 1
years 1
in 1
England 1
He 1
begged 1
my 1
father 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
live 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
kind 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
his 1
way 1
When 1
he 1
was 1
sober 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
fond 1
of 1
playing 1
backgammon 1
and 1
draughts 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
make 1
me 1
his 1
representative 1
both 1
with 1
the 1
servants 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
tradespeople 1
so 1
that 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
sixteen 1
I 1
was 1
quite 1
master 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
I 1
kept 1
all 1
the 1
keys 1
and 1
could 1
go 1
where 1
I 1
liked 1
and 1
do 1
what 1
I 1
liked 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
disturb 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
privacy 1
There 1
was 1
one 1
singular 1
exception 1
however 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
single 1
room 1
a 1
lumber 1
room 1
up 1
among 1
the 1
attics 1
which 1
was 1
invariably 1
locked 1
and 1
which 1
he 1
would 1
never 1
permit 1
either 1
me 1
or 1
anyone 1
else 1
to 1
enter 1
With 1
a 1
boy 1
s 1
curiosity 1
I 1
have 1
peeped 1
through 1
the 1
keyhole 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
never 1
able 1
to 1
see 1
more 1
than 1
such 1
a 1
collection 1
of 1
old 1
trunks 1
and 1
bundles 1
as 1
would 1
be 1
expected 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
room 1
One 1
day 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
March 1
a 1
letter 1
with 1
a 1
foreign 1
stamp 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
colonel 1
s 1
plate 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
common 1
thing 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
receive 1
letters 1
for 1
his 1
bills 1
were 1
all 1
paid 1
in 1
ready 1
money 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
friends 1
of 1
any 1
sort 1
From 1
India 1
said 1
he 1
as 1
he 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
Pondicherry 1
postmark 1
What 1
can 1
this 1
be 1
Opening 1
it 1
hurriedly 1
out 1
there 1
jumped 1
five 1
little 1
dried 1
orange 1
pips 1
which 1
pattered 1
down 1
upon 1
his 1
plate 1
I 1
began 1
to 1
laugh 1
at 1
this 1
but 1
the 1
laugh 1
was 1
struck 1
from 1
my 1
lips 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
his 1
face 1
His 1
lip 1
had 1
fallen 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
protruding 1
his 1
skin 1
the 1
colour 1
of 1
putty 1
and 1
he 1
glared 1
at 1
the 1
envelope 1
which 1
he 1
still 1
held 1
in 1
his 1
trembling 1
hand 1
K 3
he 1
shrieked 1
and 1
then 1
My 1
God 1
my 1
God 1
my 1
sins 1
have 1
overtaken 1
me 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
uncle 1
I 1
cried 1
Death 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
rising 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
he 1
retired 1
to 1
his 1
room 1
leaving 1
me 1
palpitating 1
with 1
horror 1
I 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
envelope 1
and 1
saw 1
scrawled 1
in 1
red 1
ink 1
upon 1
the 1
inner 1
flap 1
just 1
above 1
the 1
gum 1
the 1
letter 1
K 1
three 1
times 1
repeated 1
There 1
was 1
nothing 1
else 1
save 1
the 1
five 1
dried 1
pips 1
What 1
could 1
be 1
the 1
reason 1
of 1
his 1
overpowering 1
terror 1
I 1
left 1
the 1
breakfast 1
table 1
and 1
as 1
I 1
ascended 1
the 1
stair 1
I 1
met 1
him 1
coming 1
down 1
with 1
an 1
old 1
rusty 1
key 1
which 1
must 1
have 1
belonged 1
to 1
the 1
attic 1
in 1
one 1
hand 1
and 1
a 1
small 1
brass 1
box 1
like 1
a 1
cashbox 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
They 1
may 1
do 1
what 1
they 1
like 1
but 1
I 1
ll 1
checkmate 1
them 1
still 1
said 1
he 1
with 1
an 1
oath 1
Tell 1
Mary 1
that 1
I 1
shall 1
want 1
a 1
fire 1
in 1
my 1
room 1
to 1
day 1
and 1
send 1
down 1
to 1
Fordham 1
the 1
Horsham 1
lawyer 1
I 1
did 1
as 1
he 1
ordered 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
lawyer 1
arrived 1
I 1
was 1
asked 1
to 1
step 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
room 1
The 1
fire 1
was 1
burning 1
brightly 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
grate 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
mass 1
of 1
black 1
fluffy 1
ashes 1
as 1
of 1
burned 1
paper 1
while 1
the 1
brass 1
box 1
stood 1
open 1
and 1
empty 1
beside 1
it 1
As 1
I 1
glanced 1
at 1
the 1
box 1
I 1
noticed 1
with 1
a 1
start 1
that 1
upon 1
the 1
lid 1
was 1
printed 1
the 1
treble 1
K 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
read 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
upon 1
the 1
envelope 1
I 1
wish 1
you 1
John 1
said 1
my 1
uncle 1
to 1
witness 1
my 1
will 1
I 1
leave 1
my 1
estate 1
with 1
all 1
its 1
advantages 1
and 1
all 1
its 1
disadvantages 1
to 1
my 1
brother 1
your 1
father 1
whence 1
it 1
will 1
no 1
doubt 1
descend 1
to 1
you 1
If 1
you 1
can 1
enjoy 1
it 1
in 1
peace 1
well 1
and 1
good 1
If 1
you 1
find 1
you 1
cannot 1
take 1
my 1
advice 1
my 1
boy 1
and 1
leave 1
it 1
to 1
your 1
deadliest 1
enemy 1
I 1
am 1
sorry 1
to 1
give 1
you 1
such 1
a 1
two 1
edged 1
thing 1
but 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
say 1
what 1
turn 1
things 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
take 1
Kindly 1
sign 1
the 1
paper 1
where 1
Mr 1
Fordham 1
shows 1
you 1
I 1
signed 1
the 1
paper 1
as 1
directed 1
and 1
the 1
lawyer 1
took 1
it 1
away 1
with 1
him 1
The 1
singular 1
incident 1
made 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
think 1
the 1
deepest 1
impression 1
upon 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
pondered 1
over 1
it 1
and 1
turned 1
it 1
every 1
way 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
without 1
being 1
able 1
to 1
make 1
anything 1
of 1
it 1
Yet 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
shake 1
off 1
the 1
vague 1
feeling 1
of 1
dread 1
which 1
it 1
left 1
behind 1
though 1
the 1
sensation 1
grew 1
less 1
keen 1
as 1
the 1
weeks 1
passed 1
and 1
nothing 1
happened 1
to 1
disturb 1
the 1
usual 1
routine 1
of 1
our 1
lives 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
a 1
change 1
in 1
my 1
uncle 1
however 1
He 1
drank 1
more 1
than 1
ever 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
less 1
inclined 1
for 1
any 1
sort 1
of 1
society 1
Most 1
of 1
his 1
time 1
he 1
would 1
spend 1
in 1
his 1
room 1
with 1
the 1
door 1
locked 1
upon 1
the 1
inside 1
but 1
sometimes 1
he 1
would 1
emerge 1
in 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
drunken 1
frenzy 1
and 1
would 1
burst 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
tear 1
about 1
the 1
garden 1
with 1
a 1
revolver 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
screaming 1
out 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
afraid 1
of 1
no 1
man 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
cooped 1
up 1
like 1
a 1
sheep 1
in 1
a 1
pen 1
by 1
man 1
or 1
devil 1
When 1
these 1
hot 1
fits 1
were 1
over 1
however 1
he 1
would 1
rush 1
tumultuously 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
lock 1
and 1
bar 1
it 1
behind 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
can 1
brazen 1
it 1
out 1
no 1
longer 1
against 1
the 1
terror 1
which 1
lies 1
at 1
the 1
roots 1
of 1
his 1
soul 1
At 1
such 1
times 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
his 1
face 1
even 1
on 1
a 1
cold 1
day 1
glisten 1
with 1
moisture 1
as 1
though 1
it 1
were 1
new 1
raised 1
from 1
a 1
basin 1
Well 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
and 1
not 1
to 1
abuse 1
your 1
patience 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
night 1
when 1
he 1
made 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
drunken 1
sallies 1
from 1
which 1
he 1
never 1
came 1
back 1
We 1
found 1
him 1
when 1
we 1
went 1
to 1
search 1
for 1
him 1
face 1
downward 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
green 1
scummed 1
pool 1
which 1
lay 1
at 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
garden 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
any 1
violence 1
and 1
the 1
water 1
was 1
but 1
two 1
feet 1
deep 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
jury 1
having 1
regard 1
to 1
his 1
known 1
eccentricity 1
brought 1
in 1
a 1
verdict 1
of 1
suicide 1
But 1
I 1
who 1
knew 1
how 1
he 1
winced 1
from 1
the 1
very 1
thought 1
of 1
death 1
had 1
much 1
ado 1
to 1
persuade 1
myself 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
way 1
to 1
meet 1
it 1
The 1
matter 1
passed 1
however 1
and 1
my 1
father 1
entered 1
into 1
possession 1
of 1
the 1
estate 1
and 1
of 1
some 1
pounds 1
which 1
lay 1
to 1
his 1
credit 1
at 1
the 1
bank 1
One 1
moment 1
Holmes 1
interposed 1
your 1
statement 1
is 1
I 1
foresee 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
remarkable 1
to 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
listened 1
Let 1
me 1
have 1
the 1
date 1
of 1
the 1
reception 1
by 1
your 1
uncle 1
of 1
the 1
letter 1
and 1
the 1
date 1
of 1
his 1
supposed 1
suicide 1
The 1
letter 1
arrived 1
on 1
March 1
His 1
death 1
was 1
seven 1
weeks 1
later 1
upon 1
the 1
night 1
of 1
May 1
nd 1
Thank 1
you 1
Pray 1
proceed 1
When 1
my 1
father 1
took 1
over 1
the 1
Horsham 1
property 1
he 1
at 1
my 1
request 1
made 1
a 1
careful 1
examination 1
of 1
the 1
attic 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
always 1
locked 1
up 1
We 1
found 1
the 1
brass 1
box 1
there 1
although 1
its 1
contents 1
had 1
been 1
destroyed 1
On 1
the 1
inside 1
of 1
the 1
cover 1
was 1
a 1
paper 1
label 1
with 1
the 1
initials 1
of 1
K 3
repeated 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
Letters 1
memoranda 1
receipts 1
and 1
a 1
register 1
written 1
beneath 1
These 1
we 1
presume 1
indicated 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
papers 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
destroyed 1
by 1
Colonel 1
Openshaw 1
For 1
the 1
rest 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
of 1
much 1
importance 1
in 1
the 1
attic 1
save 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
scattered 1
papers 1
and 1
note 1
books 1
bearing 1
upon 1
my 1
uncle 1
s 1
life 1
in 1
America 1
Some 1
of 1
them 1
were 1
of 1
the 1
war 1
time 1
and 1
showed 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
his 1
duty 1
well 1
and 1
had 1
borne 1
the 1
repute 1
of 1
a 1
brave 1
soldier 1
Others 1
were 1
of 1
a 1
date 1
during 1
the 1
reconstruction 1
of 1
the 1
Southern 1
states 1
and 1
were 1
mostly 1
concerned 1
with 1
politics 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
evidently 1
taken 1
a 1
strong 1
part 1
in 1
opposing 1
the 1
carpet 1
bag 1
politicians 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
sent 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
North 1
Well 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
when 1
my 1
father 1
came 1
to 1
live 1
at 1
Horsham 1
and 1
all 1
went 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
possible 1
with 1
us 1
until 1
the 1
January 1
of 1
On 1
the 1
fourth 1
day 1
after 1
the 1
new 1
year 1
I 1
heard 1
my 1
father 1
give 1
a 1
sharp 1
cry 1
of 1
surprise 1
as 1
we 1
sat 1
together 1
at 1
the 1
breakfast 1
table 1
There 1
he 1
was 1
sitting 1
with 1
a 1
newly 1
opened 1
envelope 1
in 1
one 1
hand 1
and 1
five 1
dried 1
orange 1
pips 1
in 1
the 1
outstretched 1
palm 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
one 1
He 1
had 1
always 1
laughed 1
at 1
what 1
he 1
called 1
my 1
cock 1
and 1
bull 1
story 1
about 1
the 1
colonel 1
but 1
he 1
looked 1
very 1
scared 1
and 1
puzzled 1
now 1
that 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
had 1
come 1
upon 1
himself 1
Why 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
does 1
this 1
mean 1
John 1
he 1
stammered 1
My 1
heart 1
had 1
turned 1
to 1
lead 1
It 1
is 1
K 3
said 1
I 1
He 1
looked 1
inside 1
the 1
envelope 1
So 1
it 1
is 1
he 1
cried 1
Here 1
are 1
the 1
very 1
letters 1
But 1
what 1
is 1
this 1
written 1
above 1
them 1
Put 1
the 1
papers 1
on 1
the 1
sundial 1
I 1
read 1
peeping 1
over 1
his 1
shoulder 1
What 1
papers 1
What 1
sundial 1
he 1
asked 1
The 1
sundial 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
other 1
said 1
I 1
but 1
the 1
papers 1
must 1
be 1
those 1
that 1
are 1
destroyed 1
Pooh 1
said 1
he 1
gripping 1
hard 1
at 1
his 1
courage 1
We 1
are 1
in 1
a 1
civilised 1
land 1
here 1
and 1
we 1
can 1
t 1
have 1
tomfoolery 1
of 1
this 1
kind 1
Where 1
does 1
the 1
thing 1
come 1
from 1
From 1
Dundee 1
I 1
answered 1
glancing 1
at 1
the 1
postmark 1
Some 1
preposterous 1
practical 1
joke 1
said 1
he 1
What 1
have 1
I 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
sundials 1
and 1
papers 1
I 1
shall 1
take 1
no 1
notice 1
of 1
such 1
nonsense 1
I 1
should 1
certainly 1
speak 1
to 1
the 1
police 1
I 1
said 1
And 1
be 1
laughed 1
at 1
for 1
my 1
pains 1
Nothing 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
Then 1
let 1
me 1
do 1
so 1
No 1
I 1
forbid 1
you 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
have 1
a 1
fuss 1
made 1
about 1
such 1
nonsense 1
It 1
was 1
in 1
vain 1
to 1
argue 1
with 1
him 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
obstinate 1
man 1
I 1
went 1
about 1
however 1
with 1
a 1
heart 1
which 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
forebodings 1
On 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
after 1
the 1
coming 1
of 1
the 1
letter 1
my 1
father 1
went 1
from 1
home 1
to 1
visit 1
an 1
old 1
friend 1
of 1
his 1
Major 1
Freebody 1
who 1
is 1
in 1
command 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
forts 1
upon 1
Portsdown 1
Hill 1
I 1
was 1
glad 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
go 1
for 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
farther 1
from 1
danger 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
away 1
from 1
home 1
In 1
that 1
however 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
error 1
Upon 1
the 1
second 1
day 1
of 1
his 1
absence 1
I 1
received 1
a 1
telegram 1
from 1
the 1
major 1
imploring 1
me 1
to 1
come 1
at 1
once 1
My 1
father 1
had 1
fallen 1
over 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
deep 1
chalk 1
pits 1
which 1
abound 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
and 1
was 1
lying 1
senseless 1
with 1
a 1
shattered 1
skull 1
I 1
hurried 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
passed 1
away 1
without 1
having 1
ever 1
recovered 1
his 1
consciousness 1
He 1
had 1
as 1
it 1
appears 1
been 1
returning 1
from 1
Fareham 1
in 1
the 1
twilight 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
country 1
was 1
unknown 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
chalk 1
pit 1
unfenced 1
the 1
jury 1
had 1
no 1
hesitation 1
in 1
bringing 1
in 1
a 1
verdict 1
of 1
death 1
from 1
accidental 1
causes 1
Carefully 1
as 1
I 1
examined 1
every 1
fact 1
connected 1
with 1
his 1
death 1
I 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
find 1
anything 1
which 1
could 1
suggest 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
murder 1
There 1
were 1
no 1
signs 1
of 1
violence 1
no 1
footmarks 1
no 1
robbery 1
no 1
record 1
of 1
strangers 1
having 1
been 1
seen 1
upon 1
the 1
roads 1
And 1
yet 1
I 1
need 1
not 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
my 1
mind 1
was 1
far 1
from 1
at 1
ease 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
well 1
nigh 1
certain 1
that 1
some 1
foul 1
plot 1
had 1
been 1
woven 1
round 1
him 1
In 1
this 1
sinister 1
way 1
I 1
came 1
into 1
my 1
inheritance 1
You 1
will 1
ask 1
me 1
why 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
dispose 1
of 1
it 1
I 1
answer 1
because 1
I 1
was 1
well 1
convinced 1
that 1
our 1
troubles 1
were 1
in 1
some 1
way 1
dependent 1
upon 1
an 1
incident 1
in 1
my 1
uncle 1
s 1
life 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
danger 1
would 1
be 1
as 1
pressing 1
in 1
one 1
house 1
as 1
in 1
another 1
It 1
was 1
in 1
January 1
that 1
my 1
poor 1
father 1
met 1
his 1
end 1
and 1
two 1
years 1
and 1
eight 1
months 1
have 1
elapsed 1
since 1
then 1
During 1
that 1
time 1
I 1
have 1
lived 1
happily 1
at 1
Horsham 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
begun 1
to 1
hope 1
that 1
this 1
curse 1
had 1
passed 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
family 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
ended 1
with 1
the 1
last 1
generation 1
I 1
had 1
begun 1
to 1
take 1
comfort 1
too 1
soon 1
however 1
yesterday 1
morning 1
the 1
blow 1
fell 1
in 1
the 1
very 1
shape 1
in 1
which 1
it 1
had 1
come 1
upon 1
my 1
father 1
The 1
young 1
man 1
took 1
from 1
his 1
waistcoat 1
a 1
crumpled 1
envelope 1
and 1
turning 1
to 1
the 1
table 1
he 1
shook 1
out 1
upon 1
it 1
five 1
little 1
dried 1
orange 1
pips 1
This 1
is 1
the 1
envelope 1
he 1
continued 1
The 1
postmark 1
is 1
London 1
eastern 1
division 1
Within 1
are 1
the 1
very 1
words 1
which 1
were 1
upon 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
last 1
message 1
K 3
and 1
then 1
Put 1
the 1
papers 1
on 1
the 1
sundial 1
What 1
have 1
you 1
done 1
asked 1
Holmes 1
Nothing 2
To 1
tell 1
the 1
truth 1
he 1
sank 1
his 1
face 1
into 1
his 1
thin 1
white 1
hands 1
I 1
have 1
felt 1
helpless 1
I 1
have 1
felt 1
like 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
poor 1
rabbits 1
when 1
the 1
snake 1
is 1
writhing 1
towards 1
it 1
I 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
grasp 1
of 1
some 1
resistless 1
inexorable 1
evil 1
which 1
no 1
foresight 1
and 1
no 1
precautions 1
can 1
guard 1
against 1
Tut 1
tut 1
cried 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
You 1
must 1
act 1
man 1
or 1
you 1
are 1
lost 1
Nothing 1
but 1
energy 1
can 1
save 1
you 1
This 1
is 1
no 1
time 1
for 1
despair 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
the 1
police 1
Ah 1
But 1
they 1
listened 1
to 1
my 1
story 1
with 1
a 1
smile 1
I 1
am 1
convinced 1
that 1
the 1
inspector 1
has 1
formed 1
the 1
opinion 1
that 1
the 1
letters 1
are 1
all 1
practical 1
jokes 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
deaths 1
of 1
my 1
relations 1
were 1
really 1
accidents 1
as 1
the 1
jury 1
stated 1
and 1
were 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
connected 1
with 1
the 1
warnings 1
Holmes 1
shook 1
his 1
clenched 1
hands 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
Incredible 1
imbecility 1
he 1
cried 1
They 1
have 1
however 1
allowed 1
me 1
a 1
policeman 1
who 1
may 1
remain 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
with 1
me 1
Has 1
he 1
come 1
with 1
you 1
to 1
night 1
No 1
His 1
orders 1
were 1
to 1
stay 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
Again 1
Holmes 1
raved 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
Why 1
did 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
me 1
he 1
cried 1
and 1
above 1
all 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
not 1
come 1
at 1
once 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
It 1
was 1
only 1
to 1
day 1
that 1
I 1
spoke 1
to 1
Major 1
Prendergast 1
about 1
my 1
troubles 1
and 1
was 1
advised 1
by 1
him 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
you 1
It 1
is 1
really 1
two 1
days 1
since 1
you 1
had 1
the 1
letter 1
We 1
should 1
have 1
acted 1
before 1
this 1
You 1
have 1
no 1
further 1
evidence 1
I 1
suppose 1
than 1
that 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
placed 1
before 1
us 1
no 1
suggestive 1
detail 1
which 1
might 1
help 1
us 1
There 1
is 1
one 1
thing 1
said 1
John 1
Openshaw 1
He 1
rummaged 1
in 1
his 1
coat 1
pocket 1
and 1
drawing 1
out 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
discoloured 1
blue 1
tinted 1
paper 1
he 1
laid 1
it 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
I 1
have 1
some 1
remembrance 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
on 1
the 1
day 1
when 1
my 1
uncle 1
burned 1
the 1
papers 1
I 1
observed 1
that 1
the 1
small 1
unburned 1
margins 1
which 1
lay 1
amid 1
the 1
ashes 1
were 1
of 1
this 1
particular 1
colour 1
I 1
found 1
this 1
single 1
sheet 1
upon 1
the 1
floor 1
of 1
his 1
room 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
inclined 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
papers 1
which 1
has 1
perhaps 1
fluttered 1
out 1
from 1
among 1
the 1
others 1
and 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
has 1
escaped 1
destruction 1
Beyond 1
the 1
mention 1
of 1
pips 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
see 1
that 1
it 1
helps 1
us 1
much 1
I 1
think 1
myself 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
page 1
from 1
some 1
private 1
diary 1
The 1
writing 1
is 1
undoubtedly 1
my 1
uncle 1
s 1
Holmes 1
moved 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
we 1
both 1
bent 1
over 1
the 1
sheet 1
of 1
paper 1
which 1
showed 1
by 1
its 1
ragged 1
edge 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
indeed 1
been 1
torn 1
from 1
a 1
book 1
It 1
was 1
headed 1
March 1
and 1
beneath 1
were 1
the 1
following 1
enigmatical 1
notices 1
th 1
Hudson 1
came 1
Same 1

Visited 1
Paramore 1
All 1
well 1
Thank 1
you 1
said 1
Holmes 1
folding 1
up 1
the 1
paper 1
and 1
returning 1
it 1
to 1
our 1
visitor 1
And 1
now 1
you 1
must 1
on 1
no 1
account 1
lose 1
another 1
instant 1
We 1
cannot 1
spare 1
time 1
even 1
to 1
discuss 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
told 1
me 1
You 1
must 1
get 1
home 1
instantly 1
and 1
act 1
What 1
shall 1
I 1
do 1
There 1
is 1
but 1
one 1
thing 1
to 1
do 1
It 1
must 1
be 1
done 1
at 1
once 1
You 1
must 1
put 1
this 1
piece 1
of 1
paper 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
shown 1
us 1
into 1
the 1
brass 1
box 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
described 1
You 1
must 1
also 1
put 1
in 1
a 1
note 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
papers 1
were 1
burned 1
by 1
your 1
uncle 1
and 1
that 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
which 1
remains 1
You 1
must 1
assert 1
that 1
in 1
such 1
words 1
as 1
will 1
carry 1
conviction 1
with 1
them 1
Having 1
done 1
this 1
you 1
must 1
at 1
once 1
put 1
the 1
box 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
sundial 1
as 1
directed 1
Do 1
you 1
understand 1
Entirely 1
Do 1
not 1
think 1
of 1
revenge 1
or 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
at 1
present 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
gain 1
that 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
the 1
law 1
but 1
we 1
have 1
our 1
web 1
to 1
weave 1
while 1
theirs 1
is 1
already 1
woven 1
The 1
first 1
consideration 1
is 1
to 1
remove 1
the 1
pressing 1
danger 1
which 1
threatens 1
you 1
The 1
second 1
is 1
to 1
clear 1
up 1
the 1
mystery 1
and 1
to 1
punish 1
the 1
guilty 1
parties 1
I 1
thank 1
you 1
said 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
rising 1
and 1
pulling 1
on 1
his 1
overcoat 1
You 1
have 1
given 1
me 1
fresh 1
life 1
and 1
hope 1
I 1
shall 1
certainly 1
do 1
as 1
you 1
advise 1
Do 1
not 1
lose 1
an 1
instant 1
And 1
above 1
all 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
yourself 1
in 1
the 1
meanwhile 1
for 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
there 1
can 1
be 1
a 1
doubt 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
threatened 1
by 1
a 1
very 1
real 1
and 1
imminent 1
danger 1
How 1
do 1
you 1
go 1
back 1
By 1
train 1
from 1
Waterloo 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
yet 1
nine 1
The 1
streets 1
will 1
be 1
crowded 1
so 1
I 1
trust 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
be 1
in 1
safety 1
And 1
yet 1
you 1
cannot 1
guard 1
yourself 1
too 1
closely 1
I 1
am 1
armed 1
That 1
is 1
well 1
To 1
morrow 1
I 1
shall 1
set 1
to 1
work 1
upon 1
your 1
case 1
I 1
shall 1
see 1
you 1
at 1
Horsham 1
then 1
No 1
your 1
secret 1
lies 1
in 1
London 1
It 1
is 1
there 1
that 1
I 1
shall 1
seek 1
it 1
Then 1
I 1
shall 1
call 1
upon 1
you 1
in 1
a 1
day 1
or 1
in 1
two 1
days 1
with 1
news 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
box 1
and 1
the 1
papers 1
I 1
shall 1
take 1
your 1
advice 1
in 1
every 1
particular 1
He 1
shook 1
hands 1
with 1
us 1
and 1
took 1
his 1
leave 1
Outside 1
the 1
wind 1
still 1
screamed 1
and 1
the 1
rain 1
splashed 1
and 1
pattered 1
against 1
the 1
windows 1
This 1
strange 1
wild 1
story 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
come 1
to 1
us 1
from 1
amid 1
the 1
mad 1
elements 1
blown 1
in 1
upon 1
us 1
like 1
a 1
sheet 1
of 1
sea 1
weed 1
in 1
a 1
gale 1
and 1
now 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
reabsorbed 1
by 1
them 1
once 1
more 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
sat 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
in 1
silence 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
sunk 1
forward 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
bent 1
upon 1
the 1
red 1
glow 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
Then 1
he 1
lit 1
his 1
pipe 1
and 1
leaning 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
he 1
watched 1
the 1
blue 1
smoke 1
rings 1
as 1
they 1
chased 1
each 1
other 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
ceiling 1
I 1
think 1
Watson 1
he 1
remarked 1
at 1
last 1
that 1
of 1
all 1
our 1
cases 1
we 1
have 1
had 1
none 1
more 1
fantastic 1
than 1
this 1
Save 1
perhaps 1
the 1
Sign 1
of 1
Four 1
Well 1
yes 1
Save 1
perhaps 1
that 1
And 1
yet 1
this 1
John 1
Openshaw 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
walking 1
amid 1
even 1
greater 1
perils 1
than 1
did 1
the 1
Sholtos 1
But 1
have 1
you 1
I 1
asked 1
formed 1
any 1
definite 1
conception 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
these 1
perils 1
are 1
There 1
can 1
be 1
no 1
question 1
as 1
to 1
their 1
nature 1
he 1
answered 1
Then 1
what 1
are 1
they 1
Who 1
is 1
this 1
K 3
and 1
why 1
does 1
he 1
pursue 1
this 1
unhappy 1
family 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
closed 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
placed 1
his 1
elbows 1
upon 1
the 1
arms 1
of 1
his 1
chair 1
with 1
his 1
finger 1
tips 1
together 1
The 1
ideal 1
reasoner 1
he 1
remarked 1
would 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
once 1
been 1
shown 1
a 1
single 1
fact 1
in 1
all 1
its 1
bearings 1
deduce 1
from 1
it 1
not 1
only 1
all 1
the 1
chain 1
of 1
events 1
which 1
led 1
up 1
to 1
it 1
but 1
also 1
all 1
the 1
results 1
which 1
would 1
follow 1
from 1
it 1
As 1
Cuvier 1
could 1
correctly 1
describe 1
a 1
whole 1
animal 1
by 1
the 1
contemplation 1
of 1
a 1
single 1
bone 1
so 1
the 1
observer 1
who 1
has 1
thoroughly 1
understood 1
one 1
link 1
in 1
a 1
series 1
of 1
incidents 1
should 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
accurately 1
state 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
ones 1
both 1
before 1
and 1
after 1
We 1
have 1
not 1
yet 1
grasped 1
the 1
results 1
which 1
the 1
reason 1
alone 1
can 1
attain 1
to 1
Problems 1
may 1
be 1
solved 1
in 1
the 1
study 1
which 1
have 1
baffled 1
all 1
those 1
who 1
have 1
sought 1
a 1
solution 1
by 1
the 1
aid 1
of 1
their 1
senses 1
To 1
carry 1
the 1
art 1
however 1
to 1
its 1
highest 1
pitch 1
it 1
is 1
necessary 1
that 1
the 1
reasoner 1
should 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
utilise 1
all 1
the 1
facts 1
which 1
have 1
come 1
to 1
his 1
knowledge 1
and 1
this 1
in 1
itself 1
implies 1
as 1
you 1
will 1
readily 1
see 1
a 1
possession 1
of 1
all 1
knowledge 1
which 1
even 1
in 1
these 1
days 1
of 1
free 1
education 1
and 1
encyclopaedias 1
is 1
a 1
somewhat 1
rare 1
accomplishment 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
so 1
impossible 1
however 1
that 1
a 1
man 1
should 1
possess 1
all 1
knowledge 1
which 1
is 1
likely 1
to 1
be 1
useful 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
work 1
and 1
this 1
I 1
have 1
endeavoured 1
in 1
my 1
case 1
to 1
do 1
If 1
I 1
remember 1
rightly 1
you 1
on 1
one 1
occasion 1
in 1
the 1
early 1
days 1
of 1
our 1
friendship 1
defined 1
my 1
limits 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
precise 1
fashion 1
Yes 1
I 1
answered 1
laughing 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
singular 1
document 1
Philosophy 1
astronomy 1
and 1
politics 1
were 1
marked 1
at 1
zero 1
I 1
remember 1
Botany 1
variable 1
geology 1
profound 1
as 1
regards 1
the 1
mud 1
stains 1
from 1
any 1
region 1
within 1
fifty 1
miles 1
of 1
town 1
chemistry 1
eccentric 1
anatomy 1
unsystematic 1
sensational 1
literature 1
and 1
crime 1
records 1
unique 1
violin 1
player 1
boxer 1
swordsman 1
lawyer 1
and 1
self 1
poisoner 1
by 1
cocaine 1
and 1
tobacco 1
Those 1
I 1
think 1
were 1
the 1
main 1
points 1
of 1
my 1
analysis 1
Holmes 1
grinned 1
at 1
the 1
last 1
item 1
Well 1
he 1
said 1
I 1
say 1
now 1
as 1
I 1
said 1
then 1
that 1
a 1
man 1
should 1
keep 1
his 1
little 1
brain 1
attic 1
stocked 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
furniture 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
likely 1
to 1
use 1
and 1
the 1
rest 1
he 1
can 1
put 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
lumber 1
room 1
of 1
his 1
library 1
where 1
he 1
can 1
get 1
it 1
if 1
he 1
wants 1
it 1
Now 1
for 1
such 1
a 1
case 1
as 1
the 1
one 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
submitted 1
to 1
us 1
to 1
night 1
we 1
need 1
certainly 1
to 1
muster 1
all 1
our 1
resources 1
Kindly 1
hand 1
me 1
down 1
the 1
letter 1
K 1
of 1
the 1
American 1
Encyclopaedia 1
which 1
stands 1
upon 1
the 1
shelf 1
beside 1
you 1
Thank 1
you 1
Now 1
let 1
us 1
consider 1
the 1
situation 1
and 1
see 1
what 1
may 1
be 1
deduced 1
from 1
it 1
In 1
the 1
first 1
place 1
we 1
may 1
start 1
with 1
a 1
strong 1
presumption 1
that 1
Colonel 1
Openshaw 1
had 1
some 1
very 1
strong 1
reason 1
for 1
leaving 1
America 1
Men 1
at 1
his 1
time 1
of 1
life 1
do 1
not 1
change 1
all 1
their 1
habits 1
and 1
exchange 1
willingly 1
the 1
charming 1
climate 1
of 1
Florida 1
for 1
the 1
lonely 1
life 1
of 1
an 1
English 1
provincial 1
town 1
His 1
extreme 1
love 1
of 1
solitude 1
in 1
England 1
suggests 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
fear 1
of 1
someone 1
or 1
something 1
so 1
we 1
may 1
assume 1
as 1
a 1
working 1
hypothesis 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
fear 1
of 1
someone 1
or 1
something 1
which 1
drove 1
him 1
from 1
America 1
As 1
to 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
feared 1
we 1
can 1
only 1
deduce 1
that 1
by 1
considering 1
the 1
formidable 1
letters 1
which 1
were 1
received 1
by 1
himself 1
and 1
his 1
successors 1
Did 1
you 1
remark 1
the 1
postmarks 1
of 1
those 1
letters 1
The 1
first 1
was 1
from 1
Pondicherry 1
the 1
second 1
from 1
Dundee 1
and 1
the 1
third 1
from 1
London 1
From 1
East 1
London 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
deduce 1
from 1
that 1
They 1
are 1
all 1
seaports 1
That 1
the 1
writer 1
was 1
on 1
board 1
of 1
a 1
ship 1
Excellent 1
We 1
have 1
already 1
a 1
clue 1
There 1
can 1
be 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
the 1
probability 1
the 1
strong 1
probability 1
is 1
that 1
the 1
writer 1
was 1
on 1
board 1
of 1
a 1
ship 1
And 1
now 1
let 1
us 1
consider 1
another 1
point 1
In 1
the 1
case 1
of 1
Pondicherry 1
seven 1
weeks 1
elapsed 1
between 1
the 1
threat 1
and 1
its 1
fulfilment 1
in 1
Dundee 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
some 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
days 1
Does 1
that 1
suggest 1
anything 1
A 1
greater 1
distance 1
to 1
travel 1
But 1
the 1
letter 1
had 1
also 1
a 1
greater 1
distance 1
to 1
come 1
Then 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
see 1
the 1
point 1
There 1
is 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
presumption 1
that 1
the 1
vessel 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
man 1
or 1
men 1
are 1
is 1
a 1
sailing 1
ship 1
It 1
looks 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
always 1
send 1
their 1
singular 1
warning 1
or 1
token 1
before 1
them 1
when 1
starting 1
upon 1
their 1
mission 1
You 1
see 1
how 1
quickly 1
the 1
deed 1
followed 1
the 1
sign 1
when 1
it 1
came 1
from 1
Dundee 1
If 1
they 1
had 1
come 1
from 1
Pondicherry 1
in 1
a 1
steamer 1
they 1
would 1
have 1
arrived 1
almost 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
their 1
letter 1
But 1
as 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
fact 1
seven 1
weeks 1
elapsed 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
those 1
seven 1
weeks 1
represented 1
the 1
difference 1
between 1
the 1
mail 1
boat 1
which 1
brought 1
the 1
letter 1
and 1
the 1
sailing 1
vessel 1
which 1
brought 1
the 1
writer 1
It 1
is 1
possible 1
More 1
than 1
that 1
It 1
is 1
probable 1
And 1
now 1
you 1
see 1
the 1
deadly 1
urgency 1
of 1
this 1
new 1
case 1
and 1
why 1
I 1
urged 1
young 1
Openshaw 1
to 1
caution 1
The 1
blow 1
has 1
always 1
fallen 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
which 1
it 1
would 1
take 1
the 1
senders 1
to 1
travel 1
the 1
distance 1
But 1
this 1
one 1
comes 1
from 1
London 1
and 1
therefore 1
we 1
cannot 1
count 1
upon 1
delay 1
Good 1
God 1
I 1
cried 1
What 1
can 1
it 1
mean 1
this 1
relentless 1
persecution 1
The 1
papers 1
which 1
Openshaw 1
carried 1
are 1
obviously 1
of 1
vital 1
importance 1
to 1
the 1
person 1
or 1
persons 1
in 1
the 1
sailing 1
ship 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
clear 1
that 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
more 1
than 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
A 1
single 1
man 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
carried 1
out 1
two 1
deaths 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
way 1
as 1
to 1
deceive 1
a 1
coroner 1
s 1
jury 1
There 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
several 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
they 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
men 1
of 1
resource 1
and 1
determination 1
Their 1
papers 1
they 1
mean 1
to 1
have 1
be 1
the 1
holder 1
of 1
them 1
who 1
it 1
may 1
In 1
this 1
way 1
you 1
see 1
K 3
ceases 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
initials 1
of 1
an 1
individual 1
and 1
becomes 1
the 1
badge 1
of 1
a 1
society 1
But 1
of 1
what 1
society 1
Have 1
you 1
never 1
said 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
bending 1
forward 1
and 1
sinking 1
his 1
voice 1
have 1
you 1
never 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
Ku 1
Klux 1
Klan 1
I 1
never 1
have 1
Holmes 1
turned 1
over 1
the 1
leaves 1
of 1
the 1
book 1
upon 1
his 1
knee 1
Here 1
it 1
is 1
said 1
he 1
presently 1
Ku 1
Klux 1
Klan 1
A 1
name 1
derived 1
from 1
the 1
fanciful 1
resemblance 1
to 1
the 1
sound 1
produced 1
by 1
cocking 1
a 1
rifle 1
This 1
terrible 1
secret 1
society 1
was 1
formed 1
by 1
some 1
ex 1
Confederate 1
soldiers 1
in 1
the 1
Southern 1
states 1
after 1
the 1
Civil 1
War 1
and 1
it 1
rapidly 1
formed 1
local 1
branches 1
in 1
different 1
parts 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
notably 1
in 1
Tennessee 1
Louisiana 1
the 1
Carolinas 1
Georgia 1
and 1
Florida 1
Its 1
power 1
was 1
used 1
for 1
political 1
purposes 1
principally 1
for 1
the 1
terrorising 1
of 1
the 1
negro 1
voters 1
and 1
the 1
murdering 1
and 1
driving 1
from 1
the 1
country 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
were 1
opposed 1
to 1
its 1
views 1
Its 1
outrages 1
were 1
usually 1
preceded 1
by 1
a 1
warning 1
sent 1
to 1
the 1
marked 1
man 1
in 1
some 1
fantastic 1
but 1
generally 1
recognised 1
shape 1
a 1
sprig 1
of 1
oak 1
leaves 1
in 1
some 1
parts 1
melon 1
seeds 1
or 1
orange 1
pips 1
in 1
others 1
On 1
receiving 1
this 1
the 1
victim 1
might 1
either 1
openly 1
abjure 1
his 1
former 1
ways 1
or 1
might 1
fly 1
from 1
the 1
country 1
If 1
he 1
braved 1
the 1
matter 1
out 1
death 1
would 1
unfailingly 1
come 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
usually 1
in 1
some 1
strange 1
and 1
unforeseen 1
manner 1
So 1
perfect 1
was 1
the 1
organisation 1
of 1
the 1
society 1
and 1
so 1
systematic 1
its 1
methods 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
hardly 1
a 1
case 1
upon 1
record 1
where 1
any 1
man 1
succeeded 1
in 1
braving 1
it 1
with 1
impunity 1
or 1
in 1
which 1
any 1
of 1
its 1
outrages 1
were 1
traced 1
home 1
to 1
the 1
perpetrators 1
For 1
some 1
years 1
the 1
organisation 1
flourished 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
efforts 1
of 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
government 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
better 1
classes 1
of 1
the 1
community 1
in 1
the 1
South 1
Eventually 1
in 1
the 1
year 1
the 1
movement 1
rather 1
suddenly 1
collapsed 1
although 1
there 1
have 1
been 1
sporadic 1
outbreaks 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
sort 1
since 1
that 1
date 1
You 1
will 1
observe 1
said 1
Holmes 1
laying 1
down 1
the 1
volume 1
that 1
the 1
sudden 1
breaking 1
up 1
of 1
the 1
society 1
was 1
coincident 1
with 1
the 1
disappearance 1
of 1
Openshaw 1
from 1
America 1
with 1
their 1
papers 1
It 1
may 1
well 1
have 1
been 1
cause 1
and 1
effect 1
It 1
is 1
no 1
wonder 1
that 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
family 1
have 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
more 1
implacable 1
spirits 1
upon 1
their 1
track 1
You 1
can 1
understand 1
that 1
this 1
register 1
and 1
diary 1
may 1
implicate 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
men 1
in 1
the 1
South 1
and 1
that 1
there 1
may 1
be 1
many 1
who 1
will 1
not 1
sleep 1
easy 1
at 1
night 1
until 1
it 1
is 1
recovered 1
Then 1
the 1
page 1
we 1
have 1
seen 1
Is 1
such 1
as 1
we 1
might 1
expect 1
It 1
ran 1
if 1
I 1
remember 1
right 1
sent 1
the 1
pips 1
to 1
A 1
B 1
and 1
C 1
that 1
is 1
sent 1
the 1
society 1
s 1
warning 1
to 1
them 1
Then 1
there 1
are 1
successive 1
entries 1
that 1
A 1
and 1
B 1
cleared 1
or 1
left 1
the 1
country 1
and 1
finally 1
that 1
C 1
was 1
visited 1
with 1
I 1
fear 1
a 1
sinister 1
result 1
for 1
C 1
Well 1
I 1
think 1
Doctor 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
let 1
some 1
light 1
into 1
this 1
dark 1
place 1
and 1
I 1
believe 1
that 1
the 1
only 1
chance 1
young 1
Openshaw 1
has 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
is 1
to 1
do 1
what 1
I 1
have 1
told 1
him 1
There 1
is 1
nothing 1
more 1
to 1
be 1
said 1
or 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
to 1
night 1
so 1
hand 1
me 1
over 1
my 1
violin 1
and 1
let 1
us 1
try 1
to 1
forget 1
for 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
the 1
miserable 1
weather 1
and 1
the 1
still 1
more 1
miserable 1
ways 1
of 1
our 1
fellow 1
men 1
It 1
had 1
cleared 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
shining 1
with 1
a 1
subdued 1
brightness 1
through 1
the 1
dim 1
veil 1
which 1
hangs 1
over 1
the 1
great 1
city 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
was 1
already 1
at 1
breakfast 1
when 1
I 1
came 1
down 1
You 1
will 1
excuse 1
me 1
for 1
not 1
waiting 1
for 1
you 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
have 1
I 1
foresee 1
a 1
very 1
busy 1
day 1
before 1
me 1
in 1
looking 1
into 1
this 1
case 1
of 1
young 1
Openshaw 1
s 1
What 1
steps 1
will 1
you 1
take 1
I 1
asked 1
It 1
will 1
very 1
much 1
depend 1
upon 1
the 1
results 1
of 1
my 1
first 1
inquiries 1
I 1
may 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
Horsham 1
after 1
all 1
You 1
will 1
not 1
go 1
there 1
first 1
No 1
I 1
shall 1
commence 1
with 1
the 1
City 1
Just 1
ring 1
the 1
bell 1
and 1
the 1
maid 1
will 1
bring 1
up 1
your 1
coffee 1
As 1
I 1
waited 1
I 1
lifted 1
the 1
unopened 1
newspaper 1
from 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
glanced 1
my 1
eye 1
over 1
it 1
It 1
rested 1
upon 1
a 1
heading 1
which 1
sent 1
a 1
chill 1
to 1
my 1
heart 1
Holmes 1
I 1
cried 1
you 1
are 1
too 1
late 1
Ah 1
said 1
he 1
laying 1
down 1
his 1
cup 1
I 1
feared 1
as 1
much 1
How 1
was 1
it 1
done 1
He 1
spoke 1
calmly 1
but 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
deeply 1
moved 1
My 1
eye 1
caught 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
Openshaw 1
and 1
the 1
heading 1
Tragedy 1
Near 1
Waterloo 1
Bridge 1
Here 1
is 1
the 1
account 1
Between 1
nine 1
and 1
ten 1
last 1
night 1
Police 1
Constable 1
Cook 1
of 1
the 1
H 1
Division 1
on 1
duty 1
near 1
Waterloo 1
Bridge 1
heard 1
a 1
cry 1
for 1
help 1
and 1
a 1
splash 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
The 1
night 1
however 1
was 1
extremely 1
dark 1
and 1
stormy 1
so 1
that 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
help 1
of 1
several 1
passers 1
by 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
impossible 1
to 1
effect 1
a 1
rescue 1
The 1
alarm 1
however 1
was 1
given 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
aid 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
police 1
the 1
body 1
was 1
eventually 1
recovered 1
It 1
proved 1
to 1
be 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
young 1
gentleman 1
whose 1
name 1
as 1
it 1
appears 1
from 1
an 1
envelope 1
which 1
was 1
found 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
was 1
John 1
Openshaw 1
and 1
whose 1
residence 1
is 1
near 1
Horsham 1
It 1
is 1
conjectured 1
that 1
he 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
hurrying 1
down 1
to 1
catch 1
the 1
last 1
train 1
from 1
Waterloo 1
Station 1
and 1
that 1
in 1
his 1
haste 1
and 1
the 1
extreme 1
darkness 1
he 1
missed 1
his 1
path 1
and 1
walked 1
over 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
small 1
landing 1
places 1
for 1
river 1
steamboats 1
The 1
body 1
exhibited 1
no 1
traces 1
of 1
violence 1
and 1
there 1
can 1
be 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
the 1
deceased 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
victim 1
of 1
an 1
unfortunate 1
accident 1
which 1
should 1
have 1
the 1
effect 1
of 1
calling 1
the 1
attention 1
of 1
the 1
authorities 1
to 1
the 1
condition 1
of 1
the 1
riverside 1
landing 1
stages 1
We 1
sat 1
in 1
silence 1
for 1
some 1
minutes 1
Holmes 1
more 1
depressed 1
and 1
shaken 1
than 1
I 1
had 1
ever 1
seen 1
him 1
That 1
hurts 1
my 1
pride 1
Watson 1
he 1
said 1
at 1
last 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
petty 1
feeling 1
no 1
doubt 1
but 1
it 1
hurts 1
my 1
pride 1
It 1
becomes 1
a 1
personal 1
matter 1
with 1
me 1
now 1
and 1
if 1
God 1
sends 1
me 1
health 1
I 1
shall 1
set 1
my 1
hand 1
upon 1
this 1
gang 1
That 1
he 1
should 1
come 1
to 1
me 1
for 1
help 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
send 1
him 1
away 1
to 1
his 1
death 1
He 1
sprang 1
from 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
paced 1
about 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
uncontrollable 1
agitation 1
with 1
a 1
flush 1
upon 1
his 1
sallow 1
cheeks 1
and 1
a 1
nervous 1
clasping 1
and 1
unclasping 1
of 1
his 1
long 1
thin 1
hands 1
They 1
must 1
be 1
cunning 1
devils 1
he 1
exclaimed 1
at 1
last 1
How 1
could 1
they 1
have 1
decoyed 1
him 1
down 1
there 1
The 1
Embankment 1
is 1
not 1
on 1
the 1
direct 1
line 1
to 1
the 1
station 1
The 1
bridge 1
no 1
doubt 1
was 1
too 1
crowded 1
even 1
on 1
such 1
a 1
night 1
for 1
their 1
purpose 1
Well 1
Watson 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
who 1
will 1
win 1
in 1
the 1
long 1
run 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
out 1
now 1
To 1
the 1
police 1
No 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
my 1
own 1
police 1
When 1
I 1
have 1
spun 1
the 1
web 1
they 1
may 1
take 1
the 1
flies 1
but 1
not 1
before 1
All 1
day 1
I 1
was 1
engaged 1
in 1
my 1
professional 1
work 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
late 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
before 1
I 1
returned 1
to 1
Baker 1
Street 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
had 1
not 1
come 1
back 1
yet 1
It 1
was 1
nearly 1
ten 1
o 1
clock 1
before 1
he 1
entered 1
looking 1
pale 1
and 1
worn 1
He 1
walked 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
sideboard 1
and 1
tearing 1
a 1
piece 1
from 1
the 1
loaf 1
he 1
devoured 1
it 1
voraciously 1
washing 1
it 1
down 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
draught 1
of 1
water 1
You 1
are 1
hungry 1
I 1
remarked 1
Starving 1
It 1
had 1
escaped 1
my 1
memory 1
I 1
have 1
had 1
nothing 1
since 1
breakfast 1
Nothing 1
Not 1
a 1
bite 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
And 1
how 1
have 1
you 1
succeeded 1
Well 1
You 1
have 1
a 1
clue 1
I 1
have 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
hollow 1
of 1
my 1
hand 1
Young 1
Openshaw 1
shall 1
not 1
long 1
remain 1
unavenged 1
Why 1
Watson 1
let 1
us 1
put 1
their 1
own 1
devilish 1
trade 1
mark 1
upon 1
them 1
It 1
is 1
well 1
thought 1
of 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
He 1
took 1
an 1
orange 1
from 1
the 1
cupboard 1
and 1
tearing 1
it 1
to 1
pieces 1
he 1
squeezed 1
out 1
the 1
pips 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
Of 1
these 1
he 1
took 1
five 1
and 1
thrust 1
them 1
into 1
an 1
envelope 1
On 1
the 1
inside 1
of 1
the 1
flap 1
he 1
wrote 1
S 1
H 1
for 1
J 1
O 1
Then 1
he 1
sealed 1
it 1
and 1
addressed 1
it 1
to 1
Captain 1
James 1
Calhoun 1
Barque 1
Lone 1
Star 1
Savannah 1
Georgia 1
That 1
will 1
await 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
enters 1
port 1
said 1
he 1
chuckling 1
It 1
may 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
sleepless 1
night 1
He 1
will 1
find 1
it 1
as 1
sure 1
a 1
precursor 1
of 1
his 1
fate 1
as 1
Openshaw 1
did 1
before 1
him 1
And 1
who 1
is 1
this 1
Captain 1
Calhoun 1
The 1
leader 1
of 1
the 1
gang 1
I 1
shall 1
have 1
the 1
others 1
but 1
he 1
first 1
How 1
did 1
you 1
trace 1
it 1
then 1
He 1
took 1
a 1
large 1
sheet 1
of 1
paper 1
from 1
his 1
pocket 1
all 1
covered 1
with 1
dates 1
and 1
names 1
I 1
have 1
spent 1
the 1
whole 1
day 1
said 1
he 1
over 1
Lloyd 1
s 1
registers 1
and 1
files 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
papers 1
following 1
the 1
future 1
career 1
of 1
every 1
vessel 1
which 1
touched 1
at 1
Pondicherry 1
in 1
January 1
and 1
February 1
in 1
There 1
were 1
thirty 1
six 1
ships 1
of 1
fair 1
tonnage 1
which 1
were 1
reported 1
there 1
during 1
those 1
months 1
Of 1
these 1
one 1
the 1
Lone 1
Star 1
instantly 1
attracted 1
my 1
attention 1
since 1
although 1
it 1
was 1
reported 1
as 1
having 1
cleared 1
from 1
London 1
the 1
name 1
is 1
that 1
which 1
is 1
given 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
states 1
of 1
the 1
Union 1
Texas 1
I 1
think 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
and 1
am 1
not 1
sure 1
which 1
but 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
the 1
ship 1
must 1
have 1
an 1
American 1
origin 1
What 1
then 1
I 1
searched 1
the 1
Dundee 1
records 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
barque 1
Lone 1
Star 1
was 1
there 1
in 1
January 1
my 1
suspicion 1
became 1
a 1
certainty 1
I 1
then 1
inquired 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
vessels 1
which 1
lay 1
at 1
present 1
in 1
the 1
port 1
of 1
London 1
Yes 1
The 1
Lone 1
Star 1
had 1
arrived 1
here 1
last 1
week 1
I 1
went 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
Albert 1
Dock 1
and 1
found 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
taken 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
by 1
the 1
early 1
tide 1
this 1
morning 1
homeward 1
bound 1
to 1
Savannah 1
I 1
wired 1
to 1
Gravesend 1
and 1
learned 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
passed 1
some 1
time 1
ago 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
wind 1
is 1
easterly 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
she 1
is 1
now 1
past 1
the 1
Goodwins 1
and 1
not 1
very 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
Isle 1
of 1
Wight 1
What 1
will 1
you 1
do 1
then 1
Oh 1
I 1
have 1
my 1
hand 1
upon 1
him 1
He 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
mates 1
are 1
as 1
I 1
learn 1
the 1
only 1
native 1
born 1
Americans 1
in 1
the 1
ship 1
The 1
others 1
are 1
Finns 1
and 1
Germans 1
I 1
know 1
also 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
three 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
ship 1
last 1
night 1
I 1
had 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
stevedore 1
who 1
has 1
been 1
loading 1
their 1
cargo 1
By 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
their 1
sailing 1
ship 1
reaches 1
Savannah 1
the 1
mail 1
boat 1
will 1
have 1
carried 1
this 1
letter 1
and 1
the 1
cable 1
will 1
have 1
informed 1
the 1
police 1
of 1
Savannah 1
that 1
these 1
three 1
gentlemen 1
are 1
badly 1
wanted 1
here 1
upon 1
a 1
charge 1
of 1
murder 1
There 1
is 1
ever 1
a 1
flaw 1
however 1
in 1
the 1
best 1
laid 1
of 1
human 1
plans 1
and 1
the 1
murderers 1
of 1
John 1
Openshaw 1
were 1
never 1
to 1
receive 1
the 1
orange 1
pips 1
which 1
would 1
show 1
them 1
that 1
another 1
as 1
cunning 1
and 1
as 1
resolute 1
as 1
themselves 1
was 1
upon 1
their 1
track 1
Very 1
long 1
and 1
very 1
severe 1
were 1
the 1
equinoctial 1
gales 1
that 1
year 1
We 1
waited 1
long 1
for 1
news 1
of 1
the 1
Lone 1
Star 1
of 1
Savannah 1
but 1
none 1
ever 1
reached 1
us 1
We 1
did 1
at 1
last 1
hear 1
that 1
somewhere 1
far 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
Atlantic 1
a 1
shattered 1
stern 1
post 1
of 1
a 1
boat 1
was 1
seen 1
swinging 1
in 1
the 1
trough 1
of 1
a 1
wave 1
with 1
the 1
letters 1
L 1
S 1
carved 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
which 1
we 1
shall 1
ever 1
know 1
of 1
the 1
fate 1
of 1
the 1
Lone 1
Star 1

The 1

upon 1
him 1
as 1
I 1
understand 1
from 1
some 1
foolish 1
freak 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
college 1
for 1
having 1
read 1
De 1
Quincey 1
s 1
description 1
of 1
his 1
dreams 1
and 1
sensations 1
he 1
had 1
drenched 1
his 1
tobacco 1
with 1
laudanum 1
in 1
an 1
attempt 1
to 1
produce 1
the 1
same 1
effects 1
He 1
found 1
as 1
so 1
many 1
more 1
have 1
done 1
that 1
the 1
practice 1
is 1
easier 1
to 1
attain 1
than 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
and 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
he 1
continued 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
slave 1
to 1
the 1
drug 1
an 1
object 1
of 1
mingled 1
horror 1
and 1
pity 1
to 1
his 1
friends 1
and 1
relatives 1
I 1
can 1
see 1
him 1
now 1
with 1
yellow 1
pasty 1
face 1
drooping 1
lids 1
and 1
pin 1
point 1
pupils 1
all 1
huddled 1
in 1
a 1
chair 1
the 1
wreck 1
and 1
ruin 1
of 1
a 1
noble 1
man 1
One 1
night 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
June 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
ring 1
to 1
my 1
bell 1
about 1
the 1
hour 1
when 1
a 1
man 1
gives 1
his 1
first 1
yawn 1
and 1
glances 1
at 1
the 1
clock 1
I 1
sat 1
up 1
in 1
my 1
chair 1
and 1
my 1
wife 1
laid 1
her 1
needle 1
work 1
down 1
in 1
her 1
lap 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
little 1
face 1
of 1
disappointment 1
A 1
patient 1
said 1
she 1
You 1
ll 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
I 1
groaned 1
for 1
I 1
was 1
newly 1
come 1
back 1
from 1
a 1
weary 1
day 1
We 1
heard 1
the 1
door 1
open 1
a 1
few 1
hurried 1
words 1
and 1
then 1
quick 1
steps 1
upon 1
the 1
linoleum 1
Our 1
own 1
door 1
flew 1
open 1
and 1
a 1
lady 1
clad 1
in 1
some 1
dark 1
coloured 1
stuff 1
with 1
a 1
black 1
veil 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
You 1
will 1
excuse 1
my 1
calling 1
so 1
late 1
she 1
began 1
and 1
then 1
suddenly 1
losing 1
her 1
self 1
control 1
she 1
ran 1
forward 1
threw 1
her 1
arms 1
about 1
my 1
wife 1
s 1
neck 1
and 1
sobbed 1
upon 1
her 1
shoulder 1
Oh 1
I 1
m 1
in 1
such 1
trouble 1
she 1
cried 1
I 1
do 1
so 1
want 1
a 1
little 1
help 1
Why 1
said 1
my 1
wife 1
pulling 1
up 1
her 1
veil 1
it 1
is 1
Kate 1
Whitney 1
How 1
you 1
startled 1
me 1
Kate 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
an 1
idea 1
who 1
you 1
were 1
when 1
you 1
came 1
in 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
I 1
came 1
straight 1
to 1
you 1
That 1
was 1
always 1
the 1
way 1
Folk 1
who 1
were 1
in 1
grief 1
came 1
to 1
my 1
wife 1
like 1
birds 1
to 1
a 1
light 1
house 1
It 1
was 1
very 1
sweet 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
come 1
Now 1
you 1
must 1
have 1
some 1
wine 1
and 1
water 1
and 1
sit 1
here 1
comfortably 1
and 1
tell 1
us 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
Or 1
should 1
you 1
rather 1
that 1
I 1
sent 1
James 1
off 1
to 1
bed 1
Oh 1
no 2
I 1
want 1
the 1
doctor 1
s 1
advice 1
and 1
help 1
too 1
It 1
s 1
about 1
Isa 1
He 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
home 1
for 1
two 1
days 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
frightened 1
about 1
him 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
spoken 1
to 1
us 1
of 1
her 1
husband 1
s 1
trouble 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
doctor 1
to 1
my 1
wife 1
as 1
an 1
old 1
friend 1
and 1
school 1
companion 1
We 1
soothed 1
and 1
comforted 1
her 1
by 1
such 1
words 1
as 1
we 1
could 1
find 1
Did 1
she 1
know 1
where 1
her 1
husband 1
was 1
Was 1
it 1
possible 1
that 1
we 1
could 1
bring 1
him 1
back 1
to 1
her 1
It 1
seems 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
She 1
had 1
the 1
surest 1
information 1
that 1
of 1
late 1
he 1
had 1
when 1
the 1
fit 1
was 1
on 1
him 1
made 1
use 1
of 1
an 1
opium 1
den 1
in 1
the 1
farthest 1
east 1
of 1
the 1
City 1
Hitherto 1
his 1
orgies 1
had 1
always 1
been 1
confined 1
to 1
one 1
day 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
back 1
twitching 1
and 1
shattered 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
But 1
now 1
the 1
spell 1
had 1
been 1
upon 1
him 1
eight 1
and 1
forty 1
hours 1
and 1
he 1
lay 1
there 1
doubtless 1
among 1
the 1
dregs 1
of 1
the 1
docks 1
breathing 1
in 1
the 1
poison 1
or 1
sleeping 1
off 1
the 1
effects 1
There 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
she 1
was 1
sure 1
of 1
it 1
at 1
the 1
Bar 1
of 1
Gold 1
in 1
Upper 1
Swandam 1
Lane 1
But 1
what 1
was 1
she 1
to 1
do 1
How 1
could 1
she 1
a 1
young 1
and 1
timid 1
woman 1
make 1
her 1
way 1
into 1
such 1
a 1
place 1
and 1
pluck 1
her 1
husband 1
out 1
from 1
among 1
the 1
ruffians 1
who 1
surrounded 1
him 1
There 1
was 1
the 1
case 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
there 1
was 1
but 1
one 1
way 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
Might 1
I 1
not 1
escort 1
her 1
to 1
this 1
place 1
And 1
then 1
as 1
a 1
second 1
thought 1
why 1
should 1
she 1
come 1
at 1
all 1
I 1
was 1
Isa 1
Whitney 1
s 1
medical 1
adviser 1
and 1
as 1
such 1
I 1
had 1
influence 1
over 1
him 1
I 1
could 1
manage 1
it 1
better 1
if 1
I 1
were 1
alone 1
I 1
promised 1
her 1
on 1
my 1
word 1
that 1
I 1
would 1
send 1
him 1
home 1
in 1
a 1
cab 1
within 1
two 1
hours 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
indeed 1
at 1
the 1
address 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
given 1
me 1
And 1
so 1
in 1
ten 1
minutes 1
I 1
had 1
left 1
my 1
armchair 1
and 1
cheery 1
sitting 1
room 1
behind 1
me 1
and 1
was 1
speeding 1
eastward 1
in 1
a 1
hansom 1
on 1
a 1
strange 1
errand 1
as 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
though 1
the 1
future 1
only 1
could 1
show 1
how 1
strange 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
But 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
great 1
difficulty 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
stage 1
of 1
my 1
adventure 1
Upper 1
Swandam 1
Lane 1
is 1
a 1
vile 1
alley 1
lurking 1
behind 1
the 1
high 1
wharves 1
which 1
line 1
the 1
north 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
to 1
the 1
east 1
of 1
London 1
Bridge 1
Between 1
a 1
slop 1
shop 1
and 1
a 1
gin 1
shop 1
approached 1
by 1
a 1
steep 1
flight 1
of 1
steps 1
leading 1
down 1
to 1
a 1
black 1
gap 1
like 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
a 1
cave 1
I 1
found 1
the 1
den 1
of 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
search 1
Ordering 1
my 1
cab 1
to 1
wait 1
I 1
passed 1
down 1
the 1
steps 1
worn 1
hollow 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
by 1
the 1
ceaseless 1
tread 1
of 1
drunken 1
feet 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
a 1
flickering 1
oil 1
lamp 1
above 1
the 1
door 1
I 1
found 1
the 1
latch 1
and 1
made 1
my 1
way 1
into 1
a 1
long 1
low 1
room 1
thick 1
and 1
heavy 1
with 1
the 1
brown 1
opium 1
smoke 1
and 1
terraced 1
with 1
wooden 1
berths 1
like 1
the 1
forecastle 1
of 1
an 1
emigrant 1
ship 1
Through 1
the 1
gloom 1
one 1
could 1
dimly 1
catch 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
bodies 1
lying 1
in 1
strange 1
fantastic 1
poses 1
bowed 1
shoulders 1
bent 1
knees 1
heads 1
thrown 1
back 1
and 1
chins 1
pointing 1
upward 1
with 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
a 1
dark 1
lack 1
lustre 1
eye 1
turned 1
upon 1
the 1
newcomer 1
Out 1
of 1
the 1
black 1
shadows 1
there 1
glimmered 1
little 1
red 1
circles 1
of 1
light 1
now 1
bright 1
now 1
faint 1
as 1
the 1
burning 1
poison 1
waxed 1
or 1
waned 1
in 1
the 1
bowls 1
of 1
the 1
metal 1
pipes 1
The 1
most 1
lay 1
silent 1
but 1
some 1
muttered 1
to 1
themselves 1
and 1
others 1
talked 1
together 1
in 1
a 1
strange 1
low 1
monotonous 1
voice 1
their 1
conversation 1
coming 1
in 1
gushes 1
and 1
then 1
suddenly 1
tailing 1
off 1
into 1
silence 1
each 1
mumbling 1
out 1
his 1
own 1
thoughts 1
and 1
paying 1
little 1
heed 1
to 1
the 1
words 1
of 1
his 1
neighbour 1
At 1
the 1
farther 1
end 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
brazier 1
of 1
burning 1
charcoal 1
beside 1
which 1
on 1
a 1
three 1
legged 1
wooden 1
stool 1
there 1
sat 1
a 1
tall 1
thin 1
old 1
man 1
with 1
his 1
jaw 1
resting 1
upon 1
his 1
two 1
fists 1
and 1
his 1
elbows 1
upon 1
his 1
knees 1
staring 1
into 1
the 1
fire 1
As 1
I 1
entered 1
a 1
sallow 1
Malay 1
attendant 1
had 1
hurried 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
pipe 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
a 1
supply 1
of 1
the 1
drug 1
beckoning 1
me 1
to 1
an 1
empty 1
berth 1
Thank 1
you 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
come 1
to 1
stay 1
said 1
I 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
friend 1
of 1
mine 1
here 1
Mr 1
Isa 1
Whitney 1
and 1
I 1
wish 1
to 1
speak 1
with 1
him 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
movement 1
and 1
an 1
exclamation 1
from 1
my 1
right 1
and 1
peering 1
through 1
the 1
gloom 1
I 1
saw 1
Whitney 1
pale 1
haggard 1
and 1
unkempt 1
staring 1
out 1
at 1
me 1
My 1
God 1
It 1
s 1
Watson 1
said 1
he 1
He 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
pitiable 1
state 1
of 1
reaction 1
with 1
every 1
nerve 1
in 1
a 1
twitter 1
I 1
say 1
Watson 1
what 1
o 1
clock 1
is 1
it 1
Nearly 1
eleven 1
Of 1
what 1
day 1
Of 1
Friday 1
June 1
th 1
Good 1
heavens 1
I 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
Wednesday 1
It 1
is 1
Wednesday 1
What 1
d 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
frighten 1
a 1
chap 1
for 1
He 1
sank 1
his 1
face 1
onto 1
his 1
arms 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
sob 1
in 1
a 1
high 1
treble 1
key 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
Friday 1
man 1
Your 1
wife 1
has 1
been 1
waiting 1
this 1
two 1
days 1
for 1
you 1
You 1
should 1
be 1
ashamed 1
of 1
yourself 1
So 1
I 1
am 1
But 1
you 1
ve 1
got 1
mixed 1
Watson 1
for 1
I 1
have 1
only 1
been 1
here 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
three 1
pipes 1
four 1
pipes 1
I 1
forget 1
how 1
many 1
But 1
I 1
ll 1
go 1
home 1
with 1
you 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
frighten 1
Kate 1
poor 1
little 1
Kate 1
Give 1
me 1
your 1
hand 1
Have 1
you 1
a 1
cab 1
Yes 1
I 1
have 1
one 1
waiting 1
Then 1
I 1
shall 1
go 1
in 1
it 1
But 1
I 1
must 1
owe 1
something 1
Find 1
what 1
I 1
owe 1
Watson 1
I 1
am 1
all 1
off 1
colour 1
I 1
can 1
do 1
nothing 1
for 1
myself 1
I 1
walked 1
down 1
the 1
narrow 1
passage 1
between 1
the 1
double 1
row 1
of 1
sleepers 1
holding 1
my 1
breath 1
to 1
keep 1
out 1
the 1
vile 1
stupefying 1
fumes 1
of 1
the 1
drug 1
and 1
looking 1
about 1
for 1
the 1
manager 1
As 1
I 1
passed 1
the 1
tall 1
man 1
who 1
sat 1
by 1
the 1
brazier 1
I 1
felt 1
a 1
sudden 1
pluck 1
at 1
my 1
skirt 1
and 1
a 1
low 1
voice 1
whispered 1
Walk 1
past 1
me 1
and 1
then 1
look 1
back 1
at 1
me 1
The 1
words 1
fell 1
quite 1
distinctly 1
upon 1
my 1
ear 1
I 1
glanced 1
down 1
They 1
could 1
only 1
have 1
come 1
from 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
at 1
my 1
side 1
and 1
yet 1
he 1
sat 1
now 1
as 1
absorbed 1
as 1
ever 1
very 1
thin 1
very 1
wrinkled 1
bent 1
with 1
age 1
an 1
opium 1
pipe 1
dangling 1
down 1
from 1
between 1
his 1
knees 1
as 1
though 1
it 1
had 1
dropped 1
in 1
sheer 1
lassitude 1
from 1
his 1
fingers 1
I 1
took 1
two 1
steps 1
forward 1
and 1
looked 1
back 1
It 1
took 1
all 1
my 1
self 1
control 1
to 1
prevent 1
me 1
from 1
breaking 1
out 1
into 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
astonishment 1
He 1
had 1
turned 1
his 1
back 1
so 1
that 1
none 1
could 1
see 1
him 1
but 1
I 1
His 1
form 1
had 1
filled 1
out 1
his 1
wrinkles 1
were 1
gone 1
the 1
dull 1
eyes 1
had 1
regained 1
their 1
fire 1
and 1
there 1
sitting 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
grinning 1
at 1
my 1
surprise 1
was 1
none 1
other 1
than 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
He 1
made 1
a 1
slight 1
motion 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
approach 1
him 1
and 1
instantly 1
as 1
he 1
turned 1
his 1
face 1
half 1
round 1
to 1
the 1
company 1
once 1
more 1
subsided 1
into 1
a 1
doddering 1
loose 1
lipped 1
senility 1
Holmes 1
I 1
whispered 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
are 1
you 1
doing 1
in 1
this 1
den 1
As 1
low 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
he 1
answered 1
I 1
have 1
excellent 1
ears 1
If 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
the 1
great 1
kindness 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
that 1
sottish 1
friend 1
of 1
yours 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
exceedingly 1
glad 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
little 1
talk 1
with 1
you 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
cab 1
outside 1
Then 1
pray 1
send 1
him 1
home 1
in 1
it 1
You 1
may 1
safely 1
trust 1
him 1
for 1
he 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
too 1
limp 1
to 1
get 1
into 1
any 1
mischief 1
I 1
should 1
recommend 1
you 1
also 1
to 1
send 1
a 1
note 1
by 1
the 1
cabman 1
to 1
your 1
wife 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
thrown 1
in 1
your 1
lot 1
with 1
me 1
If 1
you 1
will 1
wait 1
outside 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
in 1
five 1
minutes 1
It 1
was 1
difficult 1
to 1
refuse 1
any 1
of 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
requests 1
for 1
they 1
were 1
always 1
so 1
exceedingly 1
definite 1
and 1
put 1
forward 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
quiet 1
air 1
of 1
mastery 1
I 1
felt 1
however 1
that 1
when 1
Whitney 1
was 1
once 1
confined 1
in 1
the 1
cab 1
my 1
mission 1
was 1
practically 1
accomplished 1
and 1
for 1
the 1
rest 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
wish 1
anything 1
better 1
than 1
to 1
be 1
associated 1
with 1
my 1
friend 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
singular 1
adventures 1
which 1
were 1
the 1
normal 1
condition 1
of 1
his 1
existence 1
In 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
I 1
had 1
written 1
my 1
note 1
paid 1
Whitney 1
s 1
bill 1
led 1
him 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
cab 1
and 1
seen 1
him 1
driven 1
through 1
the 1
darkness 1
In 1
a 1
very 1
short 1
time 1
a 1
decrepit 1
figure 1
had 1
emerged 1
from 1
the 1
opium 1
den 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
walking 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
with 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
For 1
two 1
streets 1
he 1
shuffled 1
along 1
with 1
a 1
bent 1
back 1
and 1
an 1
uncertain 1
foot 1
Then 1
glancing 1
quickly 1
round 1
he 1
straightened 1
himself 1
out 1
and 1
burst 1
into 1
a 1
hearty 1
fit 1
of 1
laughter 1
I 1
suppose 1
Watson 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
you 1
imagine 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
added 1
opium 1
smoking 1
to 1
cocaine 1
injections 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
little 1
weaknesses 1
on 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
favoured 1
me 1
with 1
your 1
medical 1
views 1
I 1
was 1
certainly 1
surprised 1
to 1
find 1
you 1
there 1
But 1
not 1
more 1
so 1
than 1
I 1
to 1
find 1
you 1
I 1
came 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
friend 1
And 1
I 1
to 1
find 1
an 1
enemy 1
An 1
enemy 1
Yes 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
natural 1
enemies 1
or 1
shall 1
I 1
say 1
my 1
natural 1
prey 1
Briefly 1
Watson 1
I 1
am 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
a 1
very 1
remarkable 1
inquiry 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
hoped 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
clue 1
in 1
the 1
incoherent 1
ramblings 1
of 1
these 1
sots 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
done 1
before 1
now 1
Had 1
I 1
been 1
recognised 1
in 1
that 1
den 1
my 1
life 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
worth 1
an 1
hour 1
s 1
purchase 1
for 1
I 1
have 1
used 1
it 1
before 1
now 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
purposes 1
and 1
the 1
rascally 1
Lascar 1
who 1
runs 1
it 1
has 1
sworn 1
to 1
have 1
vengeance 1
upon 1
me 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
trap 1
door 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
that 1
building 1
near 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
Paul 1
s 1
Wharf 1
which 1
could 1
tell 1
some 1
strange 1
tales 1
of 1
what 1
has 1
passed 1
through 1
it 1
upon 1
the 1
moonless 1
nights 1
What 1
You 1
do 1
not 1
mean 1
bodies 1
Ay 1
bodies 1
Watson 1
We 1
should 1
be 1
rich 1
men 1
if 1
we 1
had 1
pounds 1
for 1
every 1
poor 1
devil 1
who 1
has 1
been 1
done 1
to 1
death 1
in 1
that 1
den 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
vilest 1
murder 1
trap 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
riverside 1
and 1
I 1
fear 1
that 1
Neville 1
St 1
Clair 1
has 1
entered 1
it 1
never 1
to 1
leave 1
it 1
more 1
But 1
our 1
trap 1
should 1
be 1
here 1
He 1
put 1
his 1
two 1
forefingers 1
between 1
his 1
teeth 1
and 1
whistled 1
shrilly 1
a 1
signal 1
which 1
was 1
answered 1
by 1
a 1
similar 1
whistle 1
from 1
the 1
distance 1
followed 1
shortly 1
by 1
the 1
rattle 1
of 1
wheels 1
and 1
the 1
clink 1
of 1
horses 1
hoofs 1
Now 1
Watson 1
said 1
Holmes 1
as 1
a 1
tall 1
dog 1
cart 1
dashed 1
up 1
through 1
the 1
gloom 1
throwing 1
out 1
two 1
golden 1
tunnels 1
of 1
yellow 1
light 1
from 1
its 1
side 1
lanterns 1
You 1
ll 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
won 1
t 1
you 1
If 1
I 1
can 1
be 1
of 1
use 1
Oh 1
a 1
trusty 1
comrade 1
is 1
always 1
of 1
use 1
and 1
a 1
chronicler 1
still 1
more 1
so 1
My 1
room 1
at 1
The 1
Cedars 1
is 1
a 1
double 1
bedded 1
one 1
The 1
Cedars 1
Yes 1
that 1
is 1
Mr 1
St 1
Clair 1
s 1
house 1
I 1
am 1
staying 1
there 1
while 1
I 1
conduct 1
the 1
inquiry 1
Where 1
is 1
it 1
then 1
Near 1
Lee 1
in 1
Kent 1
We 1
have 1
a 1
seven 1
mile 1
drive 1
before 1
us 1
But 1
I 1
am 1
all 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
Of 1
course 1
you 1
are 1
You 1
ll 1
know 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
presently 1
Jump 1
up 1
here 1
All 1
right 1
John 1
we 1
shall 1
not 1
need 1
you 1
Here 1
s 1
half 1
a 1
crown 1
Look 1
out 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
morrow 1
about 1
eleven 1
Give 1
her 2
head 1
So 1
long 1
then 1
He 1
flicked 1
the 1
horse 1
with 1
his 1
whip 1
and 1
we 1
dashed 1
away 1
through 1
the 1
endless 1
succession 1
of 1
sombre 1
and 1
deserted 1
streets 1
which 1
widened 1
gradually 1
until 1
we 1
were 1
flying 1
across 1
a 1
broad 1
balustraded 1
bridge 1
with 1
the 1
murky 1
river 1
flowing 1
sluggishly 1
beneath 1
us 1
Beyond 1
lay 1
another 1
dull 1
wilderness 1
of 1
bricks 1
and 1
mortar 1
its 1
silence 1
broken 1
only 1
by 1
the 1
heavy 1
regular 1
footfall 1
of 1
the 1
policeman 1
or 1
the 1
songs 1
and 1
shouts 1
of 1
some 1
belated 1
party 1
of 1
revellers 1
A 1
dull 1
wrack 1
was 1
drifting 1
slowly 1
across 1
the 1
sky 1
and 1
a 1
star 1
or 1
two 1
twinkled 1
dimly 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
through 1
the 1
rifts 1
of 1
the 1
clouds 1
Holmes 1
drove 1
in 1
silence 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
sunk 1
upon 1
his 1
breast 1
and 1
the 1
air 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
lost 1
in 1
thought 1
while 1
I 1
sat 1
beside 1
him 1
curious 1
to 1
learn 1
what 1
this 1
new 1
quest 1
might 1
be 1
which 1
seemed 1
to 1
tax 1
his 1
powers 1
so 1
sorely 1
and 1
yet 1
afraid 1
to 1
break 1
in 1
upon 1
the 1
current 1
of 1
his 1
thoughts 1
We 1
had 1
driven 1
several 1
miles 1
and 1
were 1
beginning 1
to 1
get 1
to 1
the 1
fringe 1
of 1
the 1
belt 1
of 1
suburban 1
villas 1
when 1
he 1
shook 1
himself 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
and 1
lit 1
up 1
his 1
pipe 1
with 1
the 1
air 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
has 1
satisfied 1
himself 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
acting 1
for 1
the 1
best 1
You 1
have 1
a 1
grand 1
gift 1
of 1
silence 1
Watson 1
said 1
he 1
It 1
makes 1
you 1
quite 1
invaluable 1
as 1
a 1
companion 1
Pon 1
my 1
word 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
thing 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
have 1
someone 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
thoughts 1
are 1
not 1
over 1
pleasant 1
I 1
was 1
wondering 1
what 1
I 1
should 1
say 1
to 1
this 1
dear 1
little 1
woman 1
to 1
night 1
when 1
she 1
meets 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
You 1
forget 1
that 1
I 1
know 1
nothing 1
about 1
it 1
I 1
shall 1
just 1
have 1
time 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
the 1
facts 1
of 1
the 1
case 1
before 1
we 1
get 1
to 1
Lee 1
It 1
seems 1
absurdly 1
simple 1
and 1
yet 1
somehow 1
I 1
can 1
get 1
nothing 1
to 1
go 1
upon 1
There 1
s 1
plenty 1
of 1
thread 1
no 1
doubt 1
but 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
get 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
it 1
into 1
my 1
hand 1
Now 1
I 1
ll 1
state 1
the 1
case 1
clearly 1
and 1
concisely 1
to 1
you 1
Watson 1
and 1
maybe 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
a 1
spark 1
where 1
all 1
is 1
dark 1
to 1
me 1
Proceed 1
then 1
Some 1
years 1
ago 1
to 1
be 1
definite 1
in 1
May 1
there 1
came 1
to 1
Lee 1
a 1
gentleman 1
Neville 1
St 1
Clair 1
by 1
name 1
who 1
appeared 1
to 1
have 1
plenty 1
of 1
money 1
He 1
took 1
a 1
large 1
villa 1
laid 1
out 1
the 1
grounds 1
very 1
nicely 1
and 1
lived 1
generally 1
in 1
good 1
style 1
By 1
degrees 1
he 1
made 1
friends 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
and 1
in 1
he 1
married 1
the 1
daughter 1
of 1
a 1
local 1
brewer 1
by 1
whom 1
he 1
now 1
has 1
two 1
children 1
He 1
had 1
no 1
occupation 1
but 1
was 1
interested 1
in 1
several 1
companies 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
town 1
as 1
a 1
rule 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
returning 1
by 1
the 1
from 1
Cannon 1
Street 1
every 1
night 1
Mr 1
St 1
Clair 1
is 1
now 1
thirty 1
seven 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
is 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
temperate 1
habits 1
a 1
good 1
husband 1
a 1
very 1
affectionate 1
father 1
and 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
popular 1
with 1
all 1
who 1
know 1
him 1
I 1
may 1
add 1
that 1
his 1
whole 1
debts 1
at 1
the 1
present 1
moment 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
ascertain 1
amount 1
to 1
pounds 1
s 1
while 1
he 1
has 1
pounds 1
standing 1
to 1
his 1
credit 1
in 1
the 1
Capital 1
and 1
Counties 1
Bank 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
reason 1
therefore 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
money 1
troubles 1
have 1
been 1
weighing 1
upon 1
his 1
mind 1
Last 1
Monday 1
Mr 1
Neville 1
St 1
Clair 1
went 1
into 1
town 1
rather 1
earlier 1
than 1
usual 1
remarking 1
before 1
he 1
started 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
two 1
important 1
commissions 1
to 1
perform 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
bring 1
his 1
little 1
boy 1
home 1
a 1
box 1
of 1
bricks 1
Now 1
by 1
the 1
merest 1
chance 1
his 1
wife 1
received 1
a 1
telegram 1
upon 1
this 1
same 1
Monday 1
very 1
shortly 1
after 1
his 1
departure 1
to 1
the 1
effect 1
that 1
a 1
small 1
parcel 1
of 1
considerable 1
value 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
expecting 1
was 1
waiting 1
for 1
her 1
at 1
the 1
offices 1
of 1
the 1
Aberdeen 1
Shipping 1
Company 1
Now 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
well 1
up 1
in 1
your 1
London 1
you 1
will 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
office 1
of 1
the 1
company 1
is 1
in 1
Fresno 1
Street 1
which 1
branches 1
out 1
of 1
Upper 1
Swandam 1
Lane 1
where 1
you 1
found 1
me 1
to 1
night 1
Mrs 1
St 1
Clair 1
had 1
her 1
lunch 1
started 1
for 1
the 1
City 1
did 1
some 1
shopping 1
proceeded 1
to 1
the 1
company 1
s 1
office 1
got 1
her 1
packet 1
and 1
found 1
herself 1
at 1
exactly 1
walking 1
through 1
Swandam 1
Lane 1
on 1
her 1
way 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
station 1
Have 1
you 1
followed 1
me 1
so 1
far 1
It 1
is 1
very 1
clear 1
If 1
you 1
remember 1
Monday 1
was 1
an 1
exceedingly 1
hot 1
day 1
and 1
Mrs 1
St 1
Clair 1
walked 1
slowly 1
glancing 1
about 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
seeing 1
a 1
cab 1
as 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
in 1
which 1
she 1
found 1
herself 1
While 1
she 1
was 1
walking 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
down 1
Swandam 1
Lane 1
she 1
suddenly 1
heard 1
an 1
ejaculation 1
or 1
cry 1
and 1
was 1
struck 1
cold 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
husband 1
looking 1
down 1
at 1
her 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
her 1
beckoning 1
to 1
her 1
from 1
a 1
second 1
floor 1
window 1
The 1
window 1
was 1
open 1
and 1
she 1
distinctly 1
saw 1
his 1
face 1
which 1
she 1
describes 1
as 1
being 1
terribly 1
agitated 1
He 1
waved 1
his 1
hands 1
frantically 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
then 1
vanished 1
from 1
the 1
window 1
so 1
suddenly 1
that 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
her 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
plucked 1
back 1
by 1
some 1
irresistible 1
force 1
from 1
behind 1
One 1
singular 1
point 1
which 1
struck 1
her 1
quick 1
feminine 1
eye 1
was 1
that 1
although 1
he 1
wore 1
some 1
dark 1
coat 1
such 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
started 1
to 1
town 1
in 1
he 1
had 1
on 1
neither 1
collar 1
nor 1
necktie 1
Convinced 1
that 1
something 1
was 1
amiss 1
with 1
him 1
she 1
rushed 1
down 1
the 1
steps 1
for 1
the 1
house 1
was 1
none 1
other 1
than 1
the 1
opium 1
den 1
in 1
which 1
you 1
found 1
me 1
to 1
night 1
and 1
running 1
through 1
the 1
front 1
room 1
she 1
attempted 1
to 1
ascend 1
the 1
stairs 1
which 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
first 1
floor 1
At 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
stairs 1
however 1
she 1
met 1
this 1
Lascar 1
scoundrel 1
of 1
whom 1
I 1
have 1
spoken 1
who 1
thrust 1
her 1
back 1
and 1
aided 1
by 1
a 1
Dane 1
who 1
acts 1
as 1
assistant 1
there 1
pushed 1
her 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
street 1
Filled 1
with 1
the 1
most 1
maddening 1
doubts 1
and 1
fears 1
she 1
rushed 1
down 1
the 1
lane 1
and 1
by 1
rare 1
good 1
fortune 1
met 1
in 1
Fresno 1
Street 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
constables 1
with 1
an 1
inspector 1
all 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
to 1
their 1
beat 1
The 1
inspector 1
and 1
two 1
men 1
accompanied 1
her 1
back 1
and 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
continued 1
resistance 1
of 1
the 1
proprietor 1
they 1
made 1
their 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
which 1
Mr 1
St 1
Clair 1
had 1
last 1
been 1
seen 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
him 1
there 1
In 1
fact 1
in 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
that 1
floor 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
one 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
save 1
a 1
crippled 1
wretch 1
of 1
hideous 1
aspect 1
who 1
it 1
seems 1
made 1
his 1
home 1
there 1
Both 1
he 1
and 1
the 1
Lascar 1
stoutly 1
swore 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
front 1
room 1
during 1
the 1
afternoon 1
So 1
determined 1
was 1
their 1
denial 1
that 1
the 1
inspector 1
was 1
staggered 1
and 1
had 1
almost 1
come 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
Mrs 1
St 1
Clair 1
had 1
been 1
deluded 1
when 1
with 1
a 1
cry 1
she 1
sprang 1
at 1
a 1
small 1
deal 1
box 1
which 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
tore 1
the 1
lid 1
from 1
it 1
Out 1
there 1
fell 1
a 1
cascade 1
of 1
children 1
s 1
bricks 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
toy 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
promised 1
to 1
bring 1
home 1
This 1
discovery 1
and 1
the 1
evident 1
confusion 1
which 1
the 1
cripple 1
showed 1
made 1
the 1
inspector 1
realise 1
that 1
the 1
matter 1
was 1
serious 1
The 1
rooms 1
were 1
carefully 1
examined 1
and 1
results 1
all 1
pointed 1
to 1
an 1
abominable 1
crime 1
The 1
front 1
room 1
was 1
plainly 1
furnished 1
as 1
a 1
sitting 1
room 1
and 1
led 1
into 1
a 1
small 1
bedroom 1
which 1
looked 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
wharves 1
Between 1
the 1
wharf 1
and 1
the 1
bedroom 1
window 1
is 1
a 1
narrow 1
strip 1
which 1
is 1
dry 1
at 1
low 1
tide 1
but 1
is 1
covered 1
at 1
high 1
tide 1
with 1
at 1
least 1
four 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
feet 1
of 1
water 1
The 1
bedroom 1
window 1
was 1
a 1
broad 1
one 1
and 1
opened 1
from 1
below 1
On 1
examination 1
traces 1
of 1
blood 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
upon 1
the 1
windowsill 1
and 1
several 1
scattered 1
drops 1
were 1
visible 1
upon 1
the 1
wooden 1
floor 1
of 1
the 1
bedroom 1
Thrust 1
away 1
behind 1
a 1
curtain 1
in 1
the 1
front 1
room 1
were 1
all 1
the 1
clothes 1
of 1
Mr 1
Neville 1
St 1
Clair 1
with 1
the 1
exception 1
of 1
his 1
coat 1
His 1
boots 1
his 1
socks 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
his 1
watch 1
all 1
were 1
there 1
There 1
were 1
no 1
signs 1
of 1
violence 1
upon 1
any 1
of 1
these 1
garments 1
and 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
other 1
traces 1
of 1
Mr 1
Neville 1
St 1
Clair 1
Out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
he 1
must 1
apparently 1
have 1
gone 1
for 1
no 1
other 1
exit 1
could 1
be 1
discovered 1
and 1
the 1
ominous 1
bloodstains 1
upon 1
the 1
sill 1
gave 1
little 1
promise 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
save 1
himself 1
by 1
swimming 1
for 1
the 1
tide 1
was 1
at 1
its 1
very 1
highest 1
at 1
the 1
moment 1
of 1
the 1
tragedy 1
And 1
now 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
villains 1
who 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
immediately 1
implicated 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
The 1
Lascar 1
was 1
known 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
the 1
vilest 1
antecedents 1
but 1
as 1
by 1
Mrs 1
St 1
Clair 1
s 1
story 1
he 1
was 1
known 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
at 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
stair 1
within 1
a 1
very 1
few 1
seconds 1
of 1
her 1
husband 1
s 1
appearance 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
he 1
could 1
hardly 1
have 1
been 1
more 1
than 1
an 1
accessory 1
to 1
the 1
crime 1
His 1
defence 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
absolute 1
ignorance 1
and 1
he 1
protested 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
knowledge 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
doings 1
of 1
Hugh 1
Boone 1
his 1
lodger 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
account 1
in 1
any 1
way 1
for 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
missing 1
gentleman 1
s 1
clothes 1
So 1
much 1
for 1
the 1
Lascar 1
manager 1
Now 1
for 1
the 1
sinister 1
cripple 1
who 1
lives 1
upon 1
the 1
second 1
floor 1
of 1
the 1
opium 1
den 1
and 1
who 1
was 1
certainly 1
the 1
last 1
human 1
being 1
whose 1
eyes 1
rested 1
upon 1
Neville 1
St 1
Clair 1
His 1
name 1
is 1
Hugh 1
Boone 1
and 1
his 1
hideous 1
face 1
is 1
one 1
which 1
is 1
familiar 1
to 1
every 1
man 1
who 1
goes 1
much 1
to 1
the 1
City 1
He 1
is 1
a 1
professional 1
beggar 1
though 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
avoid 1
the 1
police 1
regulations 1
he 1
pretends 1
to 1
a 1
small 1
trade 1
in 1
wax 1
vestas 1
Some 1
little 1
distance 1
down 1
Threadneedle 1
Street 1
upon 1
the 1
left 1
hand 1
side 1
there 1
is 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
remarked 1
a 1
small 1
angle 1
in 1
the 1
wall 1
Here 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
this 1
creature 1
takes 1
his 1
daily 1
seat 1
cross 1
legged 1
with 1
his 1
tiny 1
stock 1
of 1
matches 1
on 1
his 1
lap 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
piteous 1
spectacle 1
a 1
small 1
rain 1
of 1
charity 1
descends 1
into 1
the 1
greasy 1
leather 1
cap 1
which 1
lies 1
upon 1
the 1
pavement 1
beside 1
him 1
I 1
have 1
watched 1
the 1
fellow 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
before 1
ever 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
making 1
his 1
professional 1
acquaintance 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
surprised 1
at 1
the 1
harvest 1
which 1
he 1
has 1
reaped 1
in 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
His 1
appearance 1
you 1
see 1
is 1
so 1
remarkable 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
pass 1
him 1
without 1
observing 1
him 1
A 1
shock 1
of 1
orange 1
hair 1
a 1
pale 1
face 1
disfigured 1
by 1
a 1
horrible 1
scar 1
which 1
by 1
its 1
contraction 1
has 1
turned 1
up 1
the 1
outer 1
edge 1
of 1
his 1
upper 1
lip 1
a 1
bulldog 1
chin 1
and 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
very 1
penetrating 1
dark 1
eyes 1
which 1
present 1
a 1
singular 1
contrast 1
to 1
the 1
colour 1
of 1
his 1
hair 1
all 1
mark 1
him 1
out 1
from 1
amid 1
the 1
common 1
crowd 1
of 1
mendicants 1
and 1
so 1
too 1
does 1
his 1
wit 1
for 1
he 1
is 1
ever 1
ready 1
with 1
a 1
reply 1
to 1
any 1
piece 1
of 1
chaff 1
which 1
may 1
be 1
thrown 1
at 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
passers 1
by 1
This 1
is 1
the 1
man 1
whom 1
we 1
now 1
learn 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
lodger 1
at 1
the 1
opium 1
den 1
and 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
last 1
man 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
gentleman 1
of 1
whom 1
we 1
are 1
in 1
quest 1
But 1
a 1
cripple 1
said 1
I 1
What 1
could 1
he 1
have 1
done 1
single 1
handed 1
against 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
prime 1
of 1
life 1
He 1
is 1
a 1
cripple 1
in 1
the 1
sense 1
that 1
he 1
walks 1
with 1
a 1
limp 1
but 1
in 1
other 1
respects 1
he 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
powerful 1
and 1
well 1
nurtured 1
man 1
Surely 1
your 1
medical 1
experience 1
would 1
tell 1
you 1
Watson 1
that 1
weakness 1
in 1
one 1
limb 1
is 1
often 1
compensated 1
for 1
by 1
exceptional 1
strength 1
in 1
the 1
others 1
Pray 1
continue 1
your 1
narrative 1
Mrs 1
St 1
Clair 1
had 1
fainted 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
blood 1
upon 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
escorted 1
home 1
in 1
a 1
cab 1
by 1
the 1
police 1
as 1
her 1
presence 1
could 1
be 1
of 1
no 1
help 1
to 1
them 1
in 1
their 1
investigations 1
Inspector 1
Barton 1
who 1
had 1
charge 1
of 1
the 1
case 1
made 1
a 1
very 1
careful 1
examination 1
of 1
the 1
premises 1
but 1
without 1
finding 1
anything 1
which 1
threw 1
any 1
light 1
upon 1
the 1
matter 1
One 1
mistake 1
had 1
been 1
made 1
in 1
not 1
arresting 1
Boone 1
instantly 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
allowed 1
some 1
few 1
minutes 1
during 1
which 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
communicated 1
with 1
his 1
friend 1
the 1
Lascar 1
but 1
this 1
fault 1
was 1
soon 1
remedied 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
seized 1
and 1
searched 1
without 1
anything 1
being 1
found 1
which 1
could 1
incriminate 1
him 1
There 1
were 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
some 1
blood 1
stains 1
upon 1
his 1
right 1
shirt 1
sleeve 1
but 1
he 1
pointed 1
to 1
his 1
ring 1
finger 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
cut 1
near 1
the 1
nail 1
and 1
explained 1
that 1
the 1
bleeding 1
came 1
from 1
there 1
adding 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
stains 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
observed 1
there 1
came 1
doubtless 1
from 1
the 1
same 1
source 1
He 1
denied 1
strenuously 1
having 1
ever 1
seen 1
Mr 1
Neville 1
St 1
Clair 1
and 1
swore 1
that 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
clothes 1
in 1
his 1
room 1
was 1
as 1
much 1
a 1
mystery 1
to 1
him 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
police 1
As 1
to 1
Mrs 1
St 1
Clair 1
s 1
assertion 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
actually 1
seen 1
her 1
husband 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
he 1
declared 1
that 1
she 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
either 1
mad 1
or 1
dreaming 1
He 1
was 1
removed 1
loudly 1
protesting 1
to 1
the 1
police 1
station 1
while 1
the 1
inspector 1
remained 1
upon 1
the 1
premises 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
that 1
the 1
ebbing 1
tide 1
might 1
afford 1
some 1
fresh 1
clue 1
And 1
it 1
did 1
though 1
they 1
hardly 1
found 1
upon 1
the 1
mud 1
bank 1
what 1
they 1
had 1
feared 1
to 1
find 1
It 1
was 1
Neville 1
St 1
Clair 1
s 1
coat 1
and 1
not 1
Neville 1
St 1
Clair 1
which 1
lay 1
uncovered 1
as 1
the 1
tide 1
receded 1
And 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
they 1
found 1
in 1
the 1
pockets 1
I 1
cannot 1
imagine 1
No 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
you 1
would 1
guess 1
Every 1
pocket 1
stuffed 1
with 1
pennies 1
and 1
half 1
pennies 2
and 1
half 1
pennies 1
It 1
was 1
no 1
wonder 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
swept 1
away 1
by 1
the 1
tide 1
But 1
a 1
human 1
body 1
is 1
a 1
different 1
matter 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
fierce 1
eddy 1
between 1
the 1
wharf 1
and 1
the 1
house 1
It 1
seemed 1
likely 1
enough 1
that 1
the 1
weighted 1
coat 1
had 1
remained 1
when 1
the 1
stripped 1
body 1
had 1
been 1
sucked 1
away 1
into 1
the 1
river 1
But 1
I 1
understand 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
clothes 1
were 1
found 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
Would 1
the 1
body 1
be 1
dressed 1
in 1
a 1
coat 1
alone 1
No 1
sir 1
but 1
the 1
facts 1
might 1
be 1
met 1
speciously 1
enough 1
Suppose 1
that 1
this 1
man 1
Boone 1
had 1
thrust 1
Neville 1
St 1
Clair 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
human 1
eye 1
which 1
could 1
have 1
seen 1
the 1
deed 1
What 1
would 1
he 1
do 1
then 1
It 1
would 1
of 1
course 1
instantly 1
strike 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
must 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
the 1
tell 1
tale 1
garments 1
He 1
would 1
seize 1
the 1
coat 1
then 1
and 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
act 1
of 1
throwing 1
it 1
out 1
when 1
it 1
would 1
occur 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
swim 1
and 1
not 1
sink 1
He 1
has 1
little 1
time 1
for 1
he 1
has 1
heard 1
the 1
scuffle 1
downstairs 1
when 1
the 1
wife 1
tried 1
to 1
force 1
her 1
way 1
up 1
and 1
perhaps 1
he 1
has 1
already 1
heard 1
from 1
his 1
Lascar 1
confederate 1
that 1
the 1
police 1
are 1
hurrying 1
up 1
the 1
street 1
There 1
is 1
not 1
an 1
instant 1
to 1
be 1
lost 1
He 1
rushes 1
to 1
some 1
secret 1
hoard 1
where 1
he 1
has 1
accumulated 1
the 1
fruits 1
of 1
his 1
beggary 1
and 1
he 1
stuffs 1
all 1
the 1
coins 1
upon 1
which 1
he 1
can 1
lay 1
his 1
hands 1
into 1
the 1
pockets 1
to 1
make 1
sure 1
of 1
the 1
coat 1
s 1
sinking 1
He 1
throws 1
it 1
out 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
done 1
the 1
same 1
with 1
the 1
other 1
garments 1
had 1
not 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
rush 1
of 1
steps 1
below 1
and 1
only 1
just 1
had 1
time 1
to 1
close 1
the 1
window 1
when 1
the 1
police 1
appeared 1
It 1
certainly 1
sounds 1
feasible 1
Well 1
we 1
will 1
take 1
it 1
as 1
a 1
working 1
hypothesis 1
for 1
want 1
of 1
a 1
better 1
Boone 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
told 1
you 1
was 1
arrested 1
and 1
taken 1
to 1
the 1
station 1
but 1
it 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
shown 1
that 1
there 1
had 1
ever 1
before 1
been 1
anything 1
against 1
him 1
He 1
had 1
for 1
years 1
been 1
known 1
as 1
a 1
professional 1
beggar 1
but 1
his 1
life 1
appeared 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
very 1
quiet 1
and 1
innocent 1
one 1
There 1
the 1
matter 1
stands 1
at 1
present 1
and 1
the 1
questions 1
which 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
solved 1
what 1
Neville 1
St 1
Clair 1
was 1
doing 1
in 1
the 1
opium 1
den 1
what 1
happened 1
to 1
him 1
when 1
there 1
where 1
is 1
he 1
now 1
and 1
what 1
Hugh 1
Boone 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
his 1
disappearance 1
are 1
all 1
as 1
far 1
from 1
a 1
solution 1
as 1
ever 1
I 1
confess 1
that 1
I 1
cannot 1
recall 1
any 1
case 1
within 1
my 1
experience 1
which 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
first 1
glance 1
so 1
simple 1
and 1
yet 1
which 1
presented 1
such 1
difficulties 1
While 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
had 1
been 1
detailing 1
this 1
singular 1
series 1
of 1
events 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
whirling 1
through 1
the 1
outskirts 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
town 1
until 1
the 1
last 1
straggling 1
houses 1
had 1
been 1
left 1
behind 1
and 1
we 1
rattled 1
along 1
with 1
a 1
country 1
hedge 1
upon 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
us 1
Just 1
as 1
he 1
finished 1
however 1
we 1
drove 1
through 1
two 1
scattered 1
villages 1
where 1
a 1
few 1
lights 1
still 1
glimmered 1
in 1
the 1
windows 1
We 1
are 1
on 1
the 1
outskirts 1
of 1
Lee 1
said 1
my 1
companion 1
We 1
have 1
touched 1
on 1
three 1
English 1
counties 1
in 1
our 1
short 1
drive 1
starting 1
in 1
Middlesex 1
passing 1
over 1
an 1
angle 1
of 1
Surrey 1
and 1
ending 1
in 1
Kent 1
See 1
that 1
light 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
That 1
is 1
The 1
Cedars 1
and 1
beside 1
that 1
lamp 1
sits 1
a 1
woman 1
whose 1
anxious 1
ears 1
have 1
already 1
I 1
have 1
little 1
doubt 1
caught 1
the 1
clink 1
of 1
our 1
horse 1
s 1
feet 1
But 1
why 1
are 1
you 1
not 1
conducting 1
the 1
case 1
from 1
Baker 1
Street 1
I 1
asked 1
Because 1
there 1
are 1
many 1
inquiries 1
which 1
must 1
be 1
made 1
out 1
here 1
Mrs 1
St 1
Clair 1
has 1
most 1
kindly 1
put 1
two 1
rooms 1
at 1
my 1
disposal 1
and 1
you 1
may 1
rest 1
assured 1
that 1
she 1
will 1
have 1
nothing 1
but 1
a 1
welcome 1
for 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
colleague 1
I 1
hate 1
to 1
meet 1
her 1
Watson 1
when 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
news 1
of 1
her 1
husband 1
Here 1
we 1
are 1
Whoa 1
there 1
whoa 1
We 1
had 1
pulled 1
up 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
a 1
large 1
villa 1
which 1
stood 1
within 1
its 1
own 1
grounds 1
A 1
stable 1
boy 1
had 1
run 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
horse 1
s 1
head 1
and 1
springing 1
down 1
I 1
followed 1
Holmes 1
up 1
the 1
small 1
winding 1
gravel 1
drive 1
which 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
As 1
we 1
approached 1
the 1
door 1
flew 1
open 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
blonde 1
woman 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
opening 1
clad 1
in 1
some 1
sort 1
of 1
light 1
mousseline 1
de 1
soie 1
with 1
a 1
touch 1
of 1
fluffy 1
pink 1
chiffon 1
at 1
her 1
neck 1
and 1
wrists 1
She 1
stood 1
with 1
her 1
figure 1
outlined 1
against 1
the 1
flood 1
of 1
light 1
one 1
hand 1
upon 1
the 1
door 1
one 1
half 1
raised 1
in 1
her 1
eagerness 1
her 1
body 1
slightly 1
bent 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
face 1
protruded 1
with 1
eager 1
eyes 1
and 1
parted 1
lips 1
a 1
standing 1
question 1
Well 1
she 1
cried 1
well 1
And 1
then 1
seeing 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
two 1
of 1
us 1
she 1
gave 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
hope 1
which 1
sank 1
into 1
a 1
groan 1
as 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
my 1
companion 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
No 1
good 1
news 1
None 1
No 1
bad 1
No 1
Thank 1
God 1
for 1
that 1
But 1
come 1
in 1
You 1
must 1
be 1
weary 1
for 1
you 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
long 1
day 1
This 1
is 1
my 1
friend 1
Dr 1
Watson 1
He 1
has 1
been 1
of 1
most 1
vital 1
use 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
several 1
of 1
my 1
cases 1
and 1
a 1
lucky 1
chance 1
has 1
made 1
it 1
possible 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
bring 1
him 1
out 1
and 1
associate 1
him 1
with 1
this 1
investigation 1
I 1
am 1
delighted 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
said 1
she 1
pressing 1
my 1
hand 1
warmly 1
You 1
will 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
forgive 1
anything 1
that 1
may 1
be 1
wanting 1
in 1
our 1
arrangements 1
when 1
you 1
consider 1
the 1
blow 1
which 1
has 1
come 1
so 1
suddenly 1
upon 1
us 1
My 1
dear 1
madam 1
said 1
I 2
am 1
an 1
old 1
campaigner 1
and 1
if 1
I 1
were 1
not 1
I 1
can 1
very 1
well 1
see 1
that 1
no 1
apology 1
is 1
needed 1
If 1
I 1
can 1
be 1
of 1
any 1
assistance 1
either 1
to 1
you 1
or 1
to 1
my 1
friend 1
here 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
indeed 1
happy 1
Now 1
Mr 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
said 1
the 1
lady 1
as 1
we 1
entered 1
a 1
well 1
lit 1
dining 1
room 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
of 1
which 1
a 1
cold 1
supper 1
had 1
been 1
laid 1
out 1
I 1
should 1
very 1
much 1
like 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
plain 1
questions 1
to 1
which 1
I 1
beg 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
give 1
a 1
plain 1
answer 1
Certainly 1
madam 1
Do 1
not 1
trouble 1
about 1
my 1
feelings 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
hysterical 1
nor 1
given 1
to 1
fainting 1
I 1
simply 1
wish 1
to 1
hear 1
your 1
real 2
opinion 1
Upon 1
what 1
point 1
In 1
your 1
heart 1
of 1
hearts 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
Neville 1
is 1
alive 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
embarrassed 1
by 1
the 1
question 1
Frankly 1
now 1
she 1
repeated 1
standing 1
upon 1
the 1
rug 1
and 1
looking 1
keenly 1
down 1
at 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
leaned 1
back 1
in 1
a 1
basket 1
chair 1
Frankly 1
then 1
madam 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
You 1
think 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
dead 1
I 1
do 1
Murdered 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
say 1
that 1
Perhaps 1
And 1
on 1
what 1
day 1
did 1
he 1
meet 1
his 1
death 1
On 1
Monday 1
Then 1
perhaps 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
explain 1
how 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
received 1
a 1
letter 1
from 1
him 1
to 1
day 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
sprang 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
chair 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
galvanised 1
What 1
he 1
roared 1
Yes 1
to 1
day 1
She 1
stood 1
smiling 1
holding 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
slip 1
of 1
paper 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
May 1
I 1
see 1
it 1
Certainly 1
He 1
snatched 1
it 1
from 1
her 1
in 1
his 1
eagerness 1
and 1
smoothing 1
it 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
he 1
drew 1
over 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
examined 1
it 1
intently 1
I 1
had 1
left 1
my 1
chair 1
and 1
was 1
gazing 1
at 1
it 1
over 1
his 1
shoulder 1
The 1
envelope 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
coarse 1
one 1
and 1
was 1
stamped 1
with 1
the 1
Gravesend 1
postmark 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
date 1
of 1
that 1
very 1
day 1
or 1
rather 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
considerably 1
after 1
midnight 1
Coarse 1
writing 1
murmured 1
Holmes 1
Surely 1
this 1
is 1
not 1
your 1
husband 1
s 1
writing 1
madam 1
No 1
but 1
the 1
enclosure 1
is 1
I 1
perceive 1
also 1
that 1
whoever 1
addressed 1
the 1
envelope 1
had 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
inquire 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
address 1
How 1
can 1
you 1
tell 1
that 1
The 1
name 1
you 1
see 1
is 1
in 1
perfectly 1
black 1
ink 1
which 1
has 1
dried 1
itself 1
The 1
rest 1
is 1
of 1
the 1
greyish 1
colour 1
which 1
shows 1
that 1
blotting 1
paper 1
has 1
been 1
used 1
If 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
written 1
straight 1
off 1
and 1
then 1
blotted 1
none 1
would 1
be 1
of 1
a 1
deep 1
black 1
shade 1
This 1
man 1
has 1
written 1
the 1
name 1
and 1
there 1
has 1
then 1
been 1
a 1
pause 1
before 1
he 1
wrote 1
the 1
address 1
which 1
can 1
only 1
mean 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
familiar 1
with 1
it 1
It 1
is 1
of 1
course 1
a 1
trifle 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
so 1
important 1
as 1
trifles 1
Let 1
us 1
now 1
see 1
the 1
letter 1
Ha 1
there 1
has 1
been 1
an 1
enclosure 1
here 1
Yes 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
ring 1
His 1
signet 1
ring 1
And 1
you 1
are 1
sure 1
that 1
this 1
is 1
your 1
husband 1
s 1
hand 1
One 1
of 1
his 1
hands 1
One 1
His 1
hand 1
when 1
he 1
wrote 1
hurriedly 1
It 1
is 1
very 1
unlike 1
his 1
usual 1
writing 1
and 1
yet 1
I 1
know 1
it 1
well 1
Dearest 1
do 1
not 1
be 1
frightened 1
All 1
will 1
come 1
well 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
huge 1
error 1
which 1
it 1
may 1
take 1
some 1
little 1
time 1
to 1
rectify 1
Wait 1
in 1
patience 1
NEVILLE 1
Written 1
in 1
pencil 1

the 1
fly 1
leaf 1
of 1

Hum 1
Posted 1
to 1
day 1
in 1
Gravesend 1
by 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
dirty 1
thumb 1
Ha 1
And 1
the 1
flap 1
has 1
been 1
gummed 1
if 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
very 1
much 1
in 1
error 1
by 1
a 1
person 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
chewing 1
tobacco 1
And 1
you 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
your 1
husband 1
s 1
hand 1
madam 1
None 1
Neville 1
wrote 1
those 1
words 1
And 1
they 1
were 1
posted 1
to 1
day 1
at 1
Gravesend 1
Well 1
Mrs 1
St 1
Clair 1
the 1
clouds 1
lighten 1
though 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
venture 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
the 1
danger 1
is 1
over 1
But 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
alive 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
Unless 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
clever 1
forgery 1
to 1
put 1
us 1
on 1
the 1
wrong 1
scent 1
The 1
ring 1
after 1
all 1
proves 1
nothing 1
It 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
taken 1
from 1
him 1
No 1
no 1
it 1
is 1
it 1
is 1
his 1
very 1
own 1
writing 1
Very 1
well 1
It 1
may 1
however 1
have 1
been 1
written 1
on 1
Monday 1
and 1
only 1
posted 1
to 1
day 1
That 1
is 1
possible 1
If 1
so 1
much 1
may 1
have 1
happened 1
between 1
Oh 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
discourage 1
me 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
all 1
is 1
well 1
with 1
him 1
There 1
is 1
so 1
keen 1
a 1
sympathy 1
between 1
us 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
know 1
if 1
evil 1
came 1
upon 1
him 1
On 1
the 1
very 1
day 1
that 1
I 1
saw 1
him 1
last 1
he 1
cut 1
himself 1
in 1
the 1
bedroom 1
and 1
yet 1
I 1
in 1
the 1
dining 1
room 1
rushed 1
upstairs 1
instantly 1
with 1
the 1
utmost 1
certainty 1
that 1
something 1
had 1
happened 1
Do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
would 1
respond 1
to 1
such 1
a 1
trifle 1
and 1
yet 1
be 1
ignorant 1
of 1
his 1
death 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
too 1
much 1
not 1
to 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
impression 1
of 1
a 1
woman 1
may 1
be 1
more 1
valuable 1
than 1
the 1
conclusion 1
of 1
an 1
analytical 1
reasoner 1
And 1
in 1
this 1
letter 1
you 1
certainly 1
have 1
a 1
very 1
strong 1
piece 1
of 1
evidence 1
to 1
corroborate 1
your 1
view 1
But 1
if 1
your 1
husband 1
is 1
alive 1
and 1
able 1
to 1
write 1
letters 1
why 1
should 1
he 1
remain 1
away 1
from 1
you 1
I 1
cannot 1
imagine 1
It 1
is 1
unthinkable 1
And 1
on 1
Monday 1
he 1
made 1
no 1
remarks 1
before 1
leaving 1
you 1
No 1
And 1
you 1
were 1
surprised 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
in 1
Swandam 1
Lane 1
Very 1
much 1
so 1
Was 1
the 1
window 1
open 1
Yes 1
Then 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
called 1
to 1
you 1
He 1
might 1
He 1
only 1
as 1
I 1
understand 1
gave 1
an 1
inarticulate 1
cry 1
Yes 1
A 1
call 1
for 1
help 1
you 1
thought 1
Yes 1
He 1
waved 1
his 1
hands 1
But 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
surprise 1
Astonishment 1
at 1
the 1
unexpected 1
sight 1
of 1
you 1
might 1
cause 1
him 1
to 1
throw 1
up 1
his 1
hands 1
It 1
is 1
possible 1
And 1
you 1
thought 1
he 1
was 1
pulled 1
back 1
He 1
disappeared 1
so 1
suddenly 1
He 1
might 1
have 1
leaped 1
back 1
You 1
did 1
not 1
see 1
anyone 1
else 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
No 1
but 1
this 1
horrible 1
man 1
confessed 1
to 1
having 1
been 1
there 1
and 1
the 1
Lascar 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
stairs 1
Quite 1
so 1
Your 1
husband 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
had 1
his 1
ordinary 1
clothes 1
on 1
But 1
without 1
his 1
collar 1
or 1
tie 1
I 1
distinctly 1
saw 1
his 1
bare 1
throat 1
Had 1
he 1
ever 1
spoken 1
of 1
Swandam 1
Lane 1
Never 1
Had 1
he 1
ever 1
showed 1
any 1
signs 1
of 1
having 1
taken 1
opium 1
Never 1
Thank 1
you 1
Mrs 1
St 1
Clair 1
Those 1
are 1
the 1
principal 1
points 1
about 1
which 1
I 1
wished 1
to 1
be 1
absolutely 1
clear 1
We 1
shall 1
now 1
have 1
a 1
little 1
supper 1
and 1
then 1
retire 1
for 1
we 1
may 1
have 1
a 1
very 1
busy 1
day 1
to 1
morrow 1
A 1
large 1
and 1
comfortable 1
double 1
bedded 1
room 1
had 1
been 1
placed 1
at 1
our 1
disposal 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
quickly 1
between 1
the 1
sheets 1
for 1
I 1
was 1
weary 1
after 1
my 1
night 1
of 1
adventure 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
was 1
a 1
man 1
however 1
who 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
an 1
unsolved 1
problem 1
upon 1
his 1
mind 1
would 1
go 1
for 1
days 1
and 1
even 1
for 1
a 1
week 1
without 1
rest 1
turning 1
it 1
over 1
rearranging 1
his 1
facts 1
looking 1
at 1
it 1
from 1
every 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
until 1
he 1
had 1
either 1
fathomed 1
it 1
or 1
convinced 1
himself 1
that 1
his 1
data 1
were 1
insufficient 1
It 1
was 1
soon 1
evident 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
now 1
preparing 1
for 1
an 1
all 1
night 1
sitting 1
He 1
took 1
off 1
his 1
coat 1
and 1
waistcoat 1
put 1
on 1
a 1
large 1
blue 1
dressing 1
gown 1
and 1
then 1
wandered 1
about 1
the 1
room 1
collecting 1
pillows 1
from 1
his 1
bed 1
and 1
cushions 1
from 1
the 1
sofa 1
and 1
armchairs 1
With 1
these 1
he 1
constructed 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
Eastern 1
divan 1
upon 1
which 1
he 1
perched 1
himself 1
cross 1
legged 1
with 1
an 1
ounce 1
of 1
shag 1
tobacco 1
and 1
a 1
box 1
of 1
matches 1
laid 1
out 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
In 1
the 1
dim 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
lamp 1
I 1
saw 1
him 1
sitting 1
there 1
an 1
old 1
briar 1
pipe 1
between 1
his 1
lips 1
his 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
vacantly 1
upon 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
ceiling 1
the 1
blue 1
smoke 1
curling 1
up 1
from 1
him 1
silent 1
motionless 1
with 1
the 1
light 1
shining 1
upon 1
his 1
strong 1
set 1
aquiline 1
features 1
So 1
he 1
sat 1
as 1
I 1
dropped 1
off 1
to 1
sleep 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
sat 1
when 1
a 1
sudden 1
ejaculation 1
caused 1
me 1
to 1
wake 1
up 1
and 1
I 1
found 1
the 1
summer 1
sun 1
shining 1
into 1
the 1
apartment 1
The 1
pipe 1
was 1
still 1
between 1
his 1
lips 1
the 1
smoke 1
still 1
curled 1
upward 1
and 1
the 1
room 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
a 1
dense 1
tobacco 1
haze 1
but 1
nothing 1
remained 1
of 1
the 1
heap 1
of 1
shag 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
seen 1
upon 1
the 1
previous 1
night 1
Awake 1
Watson 1
he 1
asked 1
Yes 1
Game 1
for 1
a 1
morning 1
drive 1
Certainly 1
Then 1
dress 1
No 1
one 1
is 1
stirring 1
yet 1
but 1
I 1
know 1
where 1
the 1
stable 1
boy 1
sleeps 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
soon 1
have 1
the 1
trap 1
out 1
He 1
chuckled 1
to 1
himself 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
his 1
eyes 1
twinkled 1
and 1
he 1
seemed 1
a 1
different 1
man 1
to 1
the 1
sombre 1
thinker 1
of 1
the 1
previous 1
night 1
As 1
I 1
dressed 1
I 1
glanced 1
at 1
my 1
watch 1
It 1
was 1
no 1
wonder 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
was 1
stirring 1
It 1
was 1
twenty 1
five 1
minutes 1
past 1
four 1
I 1
had 1
hardly 1
finished 1
when 1
Holmes 1
returned 1
with 1
the 1
news 1
that 1
the 1
boy 1
was 1
putting 1
in 1
the 1
horse 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
test 1
a 1
little 1
theory 1
of 1
mine 1
said 1
he 1
pulling 1
on 1
his 1
boots 1
I 1
think 1
Watson 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
now 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
absolute 1
fools 1
in 1
Europe 1
I 1
deserve 1
to 1
be 1
kicked 1
from 1
here 1
to 1
Charing 1
Cross 1
But 1
I 1
think 1
I 1
have 1
the 1
key 1
of 1
the 1
affair 1
now 1
And 1
where 1
is 1
it 1
I 1
asked 1
smiling 1
In 1
the 1
bathroom 1
he 1
answered 1
Oh 1
yes 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
joking 1
he 1
continued 1
seeing 1
my 1
look 1
of 1
incredulity 1
I 1
have 1
just 1
been 1
there 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
taken 1
it 1
out 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
got 1
it 1
in 1
this 1
Gladstone 1
bag 1
Come 1
on 1
my 1
boy 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
whether 1
it 1
will 1
not 1
fit 1
the 1
lock 1
We 1
made 1
our 1
way 1
downstairs 1
as 1
quietly 1
as 1
possible 1
and 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
bright 1
morning 1
sunshine 1
In 1
the 1
road 1
stood 1
our 1
horse 1
and 1
trap 1
with 1
the 1
half 1
clad 1
stable 1
boy 1
waiting 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
We 1
both 1
sprang 1
in 1
and 1
away 1
we 1
dashed 1
down 1
the 1
London 1
Road 1
A 1
few 1
country 1
carts 1
were 1
stirring 1
bearing 1
in 1
vegetables 1
to 1
the 1
metropolis 1
but 1
the 1
lines 1
of 1
villas 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
were 1
as 1
silent 1
and 1
lifeless 1
as 1
some 1
city 1
in 1
a 1
dream 1
It 1
has 1
been 1
in 1
some 1
points 1
a 1
singular 1
case 1
said 1
Holmes 1
flicking 1
the 1
horse 1
on 1
into 1
a 1
gallop 1
I 1
confess 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
as 1
blind 1
as 1
a 1
mole 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
better 1
to 1
learn 1
wisdom 1
late 1
than 1
never 1
to 1
learn 1
it 1
at 1
all 1
In 1
town 1
the 1
earliest 1
risers 1
were 1
just 1
beginning 1
to 1
look 1
sleepily 1
from 1
their 1
windows 1
as 1
we 1
drove 1
through 1
the 1
streets 1
of 1
the 1
Surrey 1
side 1
Passing 1
down 1
the 1
Waterloo 1
Bridge 1
Road 1
we 1
crossed 1
over 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
dashing 1
up 1
Wellington 1
Street 1
wheeled 1
sharply 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
and 1
found 1
ourselves 1
in 1
Bow 1
Street 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
was 1
well 1
known 1
to 1
the 1
force 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
constables 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
saluted 1
him 1
One 1
of 1
them 1
held 1
the 1
horse 1
s 1
head 1
while 1
the 1
other 1
led 1
us 1
in 1
Who 1
is 1
on 1
duty 1
asked 1
Holmes 1
Inspector 1
Bradstreet 1
sir 1
Ah 1
Bradstreet 1
how 1
are 1
you 1
A 1
tall 1
stout 1
official 1
had 1
come 1
down 1
the 1
stone 1
flagged 1
passage 1
in 1
a 1
peaked 1
cap 1
and 1
frogged 1
jacket 1
I 1
wish 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
quiet 1
word 1
with 1
you 1
Bradstreet 1
Certainly 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
Step 1
into 1
my 1
room 1
here 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
office 1
like 1
room 1
with 1
a 1
huge 1
ledger 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
a 1
telephone 1
projecting 1
from 1
the 1
wall 1
The 1
inspector 1
sat 1
down 1
at 1
his 1
desk 1
What 1
can 1
I 1
do 1
for 1
you 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
I 1
called 1
about 1
that 1
beggarman 1
Boone 1
the 1
one 1
who 1
was 1
charged 1
with 1
being 1
concerned 1
in 1
the 1
disappearance 1
of 1
Mr 1
Neville 1
St 1
Clair 1
of 1
Lee 1
Yes 1
He 1
was 1
brought 1
up 1
and 1
remanded 1
for 1
further 1
inquiries 1
So 1
I 1
heard 1
You 1
have 1
him 1
here 1
In 1
the 1
cells 1
Is 1
he 1
quiet 1
Oh 1
he 1
gives 1
no 1
trouble 1
But 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
dirty 1
scoundrel 1
Dirty 1
Yes 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
we 1
can 1
do 1
to 1
make 1
him 1
wash 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
his 1
face 1
is 1
as 1
black 1
as 1
a 1
tinker 1
s 1
Well 1
when 1
once 1
his 1
case 1
has 1
been 1
settled 1
he 1
will 1
have 1
a 1
regular 1
prison 1
bath 1
and 1
I 1
think 1
if 1
you 1
saw 1
him 1
you 1
would 1
agree 1
with 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
needed 1
it 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
very 1
much 1
Would 1
you 1
That 1
is 1
easily 1
done 1
Come 1
this 1
way 1
You 1
can 1
leave 1
your 1
bag 1
No 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
ll 1
take 1
it 1
Very 1
good 1
Come 1
this 1
way 1
if 1
you 1
please 1
He 1
led 1
us 1
down 1
a 1
passage 1
opened 1
a 1
barred 1
door 1
passed 1
down 1
a 1
winding 1
stair 1
and 1
brought 1
us 1
to 1
a 1
whitewashed 1
corridor 1
with 1
a 1
line 1
of 1
doors 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
The 1
third 1
on 1
the 1
right 1
is 1
his 1
said 1
the 1
inspector 1
Here 1
it 1
is 1
He 1
quietly 1
shot 1
back 1
a 1
panel 1
in 1
the 1
upper 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
glanced 1
through 1
He 1
is 1
asleep 1
said 1
he 1
You 1
can 1
see 1
him 1
very 1
well 1
We 1
both 1
put 1
our 1
eyes 1
to 1
the 1
grating 1
The 1
prisoner 1
lay 1
with 1
his 1
face 1
towards 1
us 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
deep 1
sleep 1
breathing 1
slowly 1
and 1
heavily 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
middle 1
sized 1
man 1
coarsely 1
clad 1
as 1
became 1
his 1
calling 1
with 1
a 1
coloured 1
shirt 1
protruding 1
through 1
the 1
rent 1
in 1
his 1
tattered 1
coat 1
He 1
was 1
as 1
the 1
inspector 1
had 1
said 1
extremely 1
dirty 1
but 1
the 1
grime 1
which 1
covered 1
his 1
face 1
could 1
not 1
conceal 1
its 1
repulsive 1
ugliness 1
A 1
broad 1
wheal 1
from 1
an 1
old 1
scar 1
ran 1
right 1
across 1
it 1
from 1
eye 1
to 1
chin 1
and 1
by 1
its 1
contraction 1
had 1
turned 1
up 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
upper 1
lip 1
so 1
that 1
three 1
teeth 1
were 1
exposed 1
in 1
a 1
perpetual 1
snarl 1
A 1
shock 1
of 1
very 1
bright 1
red 1
hair 1
grew 1
low 1
over 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
forehead 1
He 1
s 1
a 1
beauty 1
isn 1
t 1
he 1
said 1
the 1
inspector 1
He 1
certainly 1
needs 1
a 1
wash 1
remarked 1
Holmes 1
I 1
had 1
an 1
idea 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
and 1
I 1
took 1
the 1
liberty 1
of 1
bringing 1
the 1
tools 1
with 1
me 1
He 1
opened 1
the 1
Gladstone 1
bag 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
and 1
took 1
out 1
to 1
my 1
astonishment 1
a 1
very 1
large 1
bath 1
sponge 1
He 1
he 1
You 1
are 1
a 1
funny 1
one 1
chuckled 1
the 1
inspector 1
Now 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
the 1
great 1
goodness 1
to 1
open 1
that 1
door 1
very 1
quietly 1
we 1
will 1
soon 1
make 1
him 1
cut 1
a 1
much 1
more 1
respectable 1
figure 1
Well 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
why 1
not 1
said 1
the 1
inspector 1
He 1
doesn 1
t 1
look 1
a 1
credit 1
to 1
the 1
Bow 1
Street 1
cells 1
does 1
he 1
He 1
slipped 1
his 1
key 1
into 1
the 1
lock 1
and 1
we 1
all 1
very 1
quietly 1
entered 1
the 1
cell 1
The 1
sleeper 1
half 1
turned 1
and 1
then 1
settled 1
down 1
once 1
more 1
into 1
a 1
deep 1
slumber 1
Holmes 1
stooped 1
to 1
the 1
water 1
jug 1
moistened 1
his 1
sponge 1
and 1
then 1
rubbed 1
it 1
twice 1
vigorously 1
across 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
prisoner 1
s 1
face 1
Let 1
me 1
introduce 1
you 1
he 1
shouted 1
to 1
Mr 1
Neville 1
St 1
Clair 1
of 1
Lee 1
in 1
the 1
county 1
of 1
Kent 1
Never 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
have 1
I 1
seen 1
such 1
a 1
sight 1
The 1
man 1
s 1
face 1
peeled 1
off 1
under 1
the 1
sponge 1
like 1
the 1
bark 1
from 1
a 1
tree 1
Gone 1
was 1
the 1
coarse 1
brown 1
tint 1
Gone 1
too 1
was 1
the 1
horrid 1
scar 1
which 1
had 1
seamed 1
it 1
across 1
and 1
the 1
twisted 1
lip 1
which 1
had 1
given 1
the 1
repulsive 1
sneer 1
to 1
the 1
face 1
A 1
twitch 1
brought 1
away 1
the 1
tangled 1
red 1
hair 1
and 1
there 1
sitting 1
up 1
in 1
his 1
bed 1
was 1
a 1
pale 1
sad 1
faced 1
refined 1
looking 1
man 1
black 1
haired 1
and 1
smooth 1
skinned 1
rubbing 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
staring 1
about 1
him 1
with 1
sleepy 1
bewilderment 1
Then 1
suddenly 1
realising 1
the 1
exposure 1
he 1
broke 1
into 1
a 1
scream 1
and 1
threw 1
himself 1
down 1
with 1
his 1
face 1
to 1
the 1
pillow 1
Great 1
heavens 1
cried 1
the 1
inspector 1
it 1
is 1
indeed 1
the 1
missing 1
man 1
I 1
know 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
photograph 1
The 1
prisoner 1
turned 1
with 1
the 1
reckless 1
air 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
abandons 1
himself 1
to 1
his 1
destiny 1
Be 1
it 1
so 1
said 1
he 1
And 1
pray 1
what 1
am 1
I 1
charged 1
with 1
With 1
making 1
away 1
with 1
Mr 1
Neville 1
St 1
Oh 1
come 1
you 1
can 1
t 1
be 1
charged 1
with 1
that 1
unless 1
they 1
make 1
a 1
case 1
of 1
attempted 1
suicide 1
of 1
it 1
said 1
the 1
inspector 1
with 1
a 1
grin 1
Well 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
twenty 1
seven 1
years 1
in 1
the 1
force 1
but 1
this 1
really 1
takes 1
the 1
cake 1
If 1
I 1
am 1
Mr 1
Neville 1
St 1
Clair 1
then 1
it 1
is 1
obvious 1
that 1
no 1
crime 1
has 1
been 1
committed 1
and 1
that 1
therefore 1
I 1
am 1
illegally 1
detained 1
No 1
crime 1
but 1
a 1
very 1
great 1
error 1
has 1
been 1
committed 1
said 1
Holmes 1
You 1
would 1
have 1
done 1
better 1
to 1
have 1
trusted 1
your 1
wife 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
wife 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
children 1
groaned 1
the 1
prisoner 1
God 1
help 1
me 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
them 1
ashamed 1
of 1
their 1
father 1
My 1
God 1
What 1
an 1
exposure 1
What 1
can 1
I 1
do 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
sat 1
down 1
beside 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
couch 1
and 1
patted 1
him 1
kindly 1
on 1
the 1
shoulder 1
If 1
you 1
leave 1
it 1
to 1
a 1
court 1
of 1
law 1
to 1
clear 1
the 1
matter 1
up 1
said 1
he 1
of 1
course 1
you 1
can 1
hardly 1
avoid 1
publicity 1
On 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
if 1
you 1
convince 1
the 1
police 1
authorities 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
possible 1
case 1
against 1
you 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
any 1
reason 1
that 1
the 1
details 1
should 1
find 1
their 1
way 1
into 1
the 1
papers 1
Inspector 1
Bradstreet 1
would 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
make 1
notes 1
upon 1
anything 1
which 1
you 1
might 1
tell 1
us 1
and 1
submit 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
proper 1
authorities 1
The 1
case 1
would 1
then 1
never 1
go 1
into 1
court 1
at 1
all 1
God 1
bless 1
you 1
cried 1
the 1
prisoner 1
passionately 1
I 1
would 1
have 1
endured 1
imprisonment 1
ay 1
even 1
execution 1
rather 1
than 1
have 1
left 1
my 1
miserable 1
secret 1
as 1
a 1
family 1
blot 1
to 1
my 1
children 1
You 1
are 1
the 1
first 1
who 1
have 1
ever 1
heard 1
my 1
story 1
My 1
father 1
was 1
a 1
schoolmaster 1
in 1
Chesterfield 1
where 1
I 1
received 1
an 1
excellent 1
education 1
I 1
travelled 1
in 1
my 1
youth 1
took 1
to 1
the 1
stage 1
and 1
finally 1
became 1
a 1
reporter 1
on 1
an 1
evening 1
paper 1
in 1
London 1
One 1
day 1
my 1
editor 1
wished 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
series 1
of 1
articles 1
upon 1
begging 1
in 1
the 1
metropolis 1
and 1
I 1
volunteered 1
to 1
supply 1
them 1
There 1
was 1
the 1
point 1
from 1
which 1
all 1
my 1
adventures 1
started 1
It 1
was 1
only 1
by 1
trying 1
begging 1
as 1
an 1
amateur 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
get 1
the 1
facts 1
upon 1
which 1
to 1
base 1
my 1
articles 1
When 1
an 1
actor 1
I 1
had 1
of 1
course 1
learned 1
all 1
the 1
secrets 1
of 1
making 1
up 1
and 1
had 1
been 1
famous 1
in 1
the 1
green 1
room 1
for 1
my 1
skill 1
I 1
took 1
advantage 1
now 1
of 1
my 1
attainments 1
I 1
painted 1
my 1
face 1
and 1
to 1
make 1
myself 1
as 1
pitiable 1
as 1
possible 1
I 1
made 1
a 1
good 1
scar 1
and 1
fixed 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
my 1
lip 1
in 1
a 1
twist 1
by 1
the 1
aid 1
of 1
a 1
small 1
slip 1
of 1
flesh 1
coloured 1
plaster 1
Then 1
with 1
a 1
red 1
head 1
of 1
hair 1
and 1
an 1
appropriate 1
dress 1
I 1
took 1
my 1
station 1
in 1
the 1
business 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
ostensibly 1
as 1
a 1
match 1
seller 1
but 1
really 1
as 1
a 1
beggar 1
For 1
seven 1
hours 1
I 1
plied 1
my 1
trade 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
returned 1
home 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
I 1
found 1
to 1
my 1
surprise 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
received 1
no 1
less 1
than 1
s 1
d 1
I 1
wrote 1
my 1
articles 1
and 1
thought 1
little 1
more 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
until 1
some 1
time 1
later 1
I 1
backed 1
a 1
bill 1
for 1
a 1
friend 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
writ 1
served 1
upon 1
me 1
for 1
pounds 1
I 1
was 1
at 1
my 1
wit 1
s 1
end 1
where 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
money 1
but 1
a 1
sudden 1
idea 1
came 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
begged 1
a 1
fortnight 1
s 1
grace 1
from 1
the 1
creditor 1
asked 1
for 1
a 1
holiday 1
from 1
my 1
employers 1
and 1
spent 1
the 1
time 1
in 1
begging 1
in 1
the 1
City 1
under 1
my 1
disguise 1
In 1
ten 1
days 1
I 1
had 1
the 1
money 1
and 1
had 1
paid 1
the 1
debt 1
Well 1
you 1
can 1
imagine 1
how 1
hard 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
settle 1
down 1
to 1
arduous 1
work 1
at 1
pounds 1
a 1
week 1
when 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
earn 1
as 1
much 1
in 1
a 1
day 1
by 1
smearing 1
my 1
face 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
paint 1
laying 1
my 1
cap 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
sitting 1
still 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
fight 1
between 1
my 1
pride 1
and 1
the 1
money 1
but 1
the 1
dollars 1
won 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
I 1
threw 1
up 1
reporting 1
and 1
sat 1
day 1
after 1
day 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
first 1
chosen 1
inspiring 1
pity 1
by 1
my 1
ghastly 1
face 1
and 1
filling 1
my 1
pockets 1
with 1
coppers 1
Only 1
one 1
man 1
knew 1
my 1
secret 1
He 1
was 1
the 1
keeper 1
of 1
a 1
low 1
den 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
used 1
to 1
lodge 1
in 1
Swandam 1
Lane 1
where 1
I 1
could 1
every 1
morning 1
emerge 1
as 1
a 1
squalid 1
beggar 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
evenings 1
transform 1
myself 1
into 1
a 1
well 1
dressed 1
man 1
about 1
town 1
This 1
fellow 1
a 1
Lascar 1
was 1
well 1
paid 1
by 1
me 1
for 1
his 1
rooms 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
my 1
secret 1
was 1
safe 1
in 1
his 1
possession 1
Well 1
very 1
soon 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
saving 1
considerable 1
sums 1
of 1
money 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
mean 1
that 1
any 1
beggar 1
in 1
the 1
streets 1
of 1
London 1
could 1
earn 1
pounds 1
a 1
year 1
which 1
is 1
less 1
than 1
my 1
average 1
takings 1
but 1
I 1
had 1
exceptional 1
advantages 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
of 1
making 1
up 1
and 1
also 1
in 1
a 1
facility 1
of 1
repartee 1
which 1
improved 1
by 1
practice 1
and 1
made 1
me 1
quite 1
a 1
recognised 1
character 1
in 1
the 1
City 1
All 1
day 1
a 1
stream 1
of 1
pennies 1
varied 1
by 1
silver 1
poured 1
in 1
upon 1
me 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
bad 1
day 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
failed 1
to 1
take 1
pounds 1
As 1
I 1
grew 1
richer 1
I 1
grew 1
more 1
ambitious 1
took 1
a 1
house 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
and 1
eventually 1
married 1
without 1
anyone 1
having 1
a 1
suspicion 1
as 1
to 1
my 1
real 1
occupation 1
My 1
dear 1
wife 1
knew 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
business 1
in 1
the 1
City 1
She 1
little 1
knew 1
what 1
Last 1
Monday 1
I 1
had 1
finished 1
for 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
was 1
dressing 1
in 1
my 1
room 1
above 1
the 1
opium 1
den 1
when 1
I 1
looked 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
window 1
and 1
saw 1
to 1
my 1
horror 1
and 1
astonishment 1
that 1
my 1
wife 1
was 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
street 1
with 1
her 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
full 1
upon 1
me 1
I 1
gave 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
surprise 1
threw 1
up 1
my 1
arms 1
to 1
cover 1
my 1
face 1
and 1
rushing 1
to 1
my 1
confidant 1
the 1
Lascar 1
entreated 1
him 1
to 1
prevent 1
anyone 1
from 1
coming 1
up 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
heard 1
her 1
voice 1
downstairs 1
but 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
ascend 1
Swiftly 1
I 1
threw 1
off 1
my 1
clothes 1
pulled 1
on 1
those 1
of 1
a 1
beggar 1
and 1
put 1
on 1
my 1
pigments 1
and 1
wig 1
Even 1
a 1
wife 1
s 1
eyes 1
could 1
not 1
pierce 1
so 1
complete 1
a 1
disguise 1
But 1
then 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
there 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
search 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
clothes 1
might 1
betray 1
me 1
I 1
threw 1
open 1
the 1
window 1
reopening 1
by 1
my 1
violence 1
a 1
small 1
cut 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
inflicted 1
upon 1
myself 1
in 1
the 1
bedroom 1
that 1
morning 1
Then 1
I 1
seized 1
my 1
coat 1
which 1
was 1
weighted 1
by 1
the 1
coppers 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
just 1
transferred 1
to 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
leather 1
bag 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
carried 1
my 1
takings 1
I 1
hurled 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
it 1
disappeared 1
into 1
the 1
Thames 1
The 1
other 1
clothes 1
would 1
have 1
followed 1
but 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
rush 1
of 1
constables 1
up 1
the 1
stair 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
after 1
I 1
found 1
rather 1
I 1
confess 1
to 1
my 1
relief 1
that 1
instead 1
of 1
being 1
identified 1
as 1
Mr 1
Neville 1
St 1
Clair 1
I 1
was 1
arrested 1
as 1
his 1
murderer 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
anything 1
else 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
explain 1
I 1
was 1
determined 1
to 1
preserve 1
my 1
disguise 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
possible 1
and 1
hence 1
my 1
preference 1
for 1
a 1
dirty 1
face 1
Knowing 1
that 1
my 1
wife 1
would 1
be 1
terribly 1
anxious 1
I 1
slipped 1
off 1
my 1
ring 1
and 1
confided 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
Lascar 1
at 1
a 1
moment 1
when 1
no 1
constable 1
was 1
watching 1
me 1
together 1
with 1
a 1
hurried 1
scrawl 1
telling 1
her 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
cause 1
to 1
fear 1
That 1
note 1
only 1
reached 1
her 1
yesterday 1
said 1
Holmes 1
Good 1
God 1
What 1
a 1
week 1
she 1
must 1
have 1
spent 1
The 1
police 1
have 1
watched 1
this 1
Lascar 1
said 1
Inspector 1
Bradstreet 1
and 1
I 1
can 1
quite 1
understand 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
find 1
it 1
difficult 1
to 1
post 1
a 1
letter 1
unobserved 1
Probably 1
he 1
handed 1
it 1
to 1
some 1
sailor 1
customer 1
of 1
his 1
who 1
forgot 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
for 1
some 1
days 1
That 1
was 1
it 1
said 1
Holmes 1
nodding 1
approvingly 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
of 1
it 1
But 1
have 1
you 1
never 1
been 1
prosecuted 1
for 1
begging 1
Many 1
times 1
but 1
what 1
was 1
a 1
fine 1
to 1
me 1
It 1
must 1
stop 1
here 1
however 1
said 1
Bradstreet 1
If 1
the 1
police 1
are 1
to 1
hush 1
this 1
thing 1
up 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
no 1
more 1
of 1
Hugh 1
Boone 1
I 1
have 1
sworn 1
it 1
by 1
the 1
most 1
solemn 1
oaths 1
which 1
a 1
man 1
can 1
take 1
In 1
that 1
case 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
probable 1
that 1
no 1
further 1
steps 1
may 1
be 1
taken 1
But 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
found 1
again 1
then 1
all 1
must 1
come 1
out 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
very 1
much 1
indebted 1
to 1
you 1
for 1
having 1
cleared 1
the 1
matter 1
up 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
knew 1
how 1
you 1
reach 1
your 1
results 1
I 1
reached 1
this 1
one 1
said 1
my 1
friend 1
by 1
sitting 1
upon 1
five 1
pillows 1
and 1
consuming 1
an 1
ounce 1
of 1
shag 1
I 1
think 1
Watson 1
that 1
if 1
we 1
drive 1
to 1
Baker 1
Street 1
we 1
shall 1
just 1
be 1
in 1
time 1
for 1
breakfast 1
VII 1
THE 1
ADVENTURE 1
OF 1
THE 1
BLUE 1
CARBUNCLE 1
I 1
had 1
called 1
upon 1
my 1
friend 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
upon 1
the 1
second 1
morning 1
after 1
Christmas 1
with 1
the 1
intention 1
of 1
wishing 1
him 1
the 1
compliments 1
of 1
the 1
season 1
He 1
was 1
lounging 1
upon 1
the 1
sofa 1
in 1
a 1
purple 1
dressing 1
gown 1
a 1
pipe 1
rack 1
within 1
his 1
reach 1
upon 1
the 1
right 1
and 1
a 1
pile 1
of 1
crumpled 1
morning 1
papers 1
evidently 1
newly 1
studied 1
near 1
at 1
hand 1
Beside 1
the 1
couch 1
was 1
a 1
wooden 1
chair 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
angle 1
of 1
the 1
back 1
hung 1
a 1
very 1
seedy 1
and 1
disreputable 1
hard 1
felt 1
hat 1
much 1
the 1
worse 1
for 1
wear 1
and 1
cracked 1
in 1
several 1
places 1
A 1
lens 1
and 1
a 1
forceps 1
lying 1
upon 1
the 1
seat 1
of 1
the 1
chair 1
suggested 1
that 1
the 1
hat 1
had 1
been 1
suspended 1
in 1
this 1
manner 1
for 1
the 1
purpose 1
of 1
examination 1
You 1
are 1
engaged 1
said 1
I 1
perhaps 1
I 1
interrupt 1
you 1
Not 1
at 1
all 1
I 1
am 1
glad 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
friend 1
with 1
whom 1
I 1
can 1
discuss 1
my 1
results 1
The 1
matter 1
is 1
a 1
perfectly 1
trivial 1
one 1
he 1
jerked 1
his 1
thumb 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
hat 1
but 1
there 1
are 1
points 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
it 1
which 1
are 1
not 1
entirely 1
devoid 1
of 1
interest 1
and 1
even 1
of 1
instruction 1
I 1
seated 1
myself 1
in 1
his 1
armchair 1
and 1
warmed 1
my 1
hands 1
before 1
his 1
crackling 1
fire 1
for 1
a 1
sharp 1
frost 1
had 1
set 1
in 1
and 1
the 1
windows 1
were 1
thick 1
with 1
the 1
ice 1
crystals 1
I 1
suppose 1
I 1
remarked 1
that 1
homely 1
as 1
it 1
looks 1
this 1
thing 1
has 1
some 1
deadly 1
story 1
linked 1
on 1
to 1
it 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
clue 1
which 1
will 1
guide 1
you 1
in 1
the 1
solution 1
of 1
some 1
mystery 1
and 1
the 1
punishment 1
of 1
some 1
crime 1
No 1
no 1
No 1
crime 1
said 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
laughing 1
Only 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
whimsical 1
little 1
incidents 1
which 1
will 1
happen 1
when 1
you 1
have 1
four 1
million 1
human 1
beings 1
all 1
jostling 1
each 1
other 1
within 1
the 1
space 1
of 1
a 1
few 1
square 1
miles 1
Amid 1
the 1
action 1
and 1
reaction 1
of 1
so 1
dense 1
a 1
swarm 1
of 1
humanity 1
every 1
possible 1
combination 1
of 1
events 1
may 1
be 1
expected 1
to 1
take 1
place 1
and 1
many 1
a 1
little 1
problem 1
will 1
be 1
presented 1
which 1
may 1
be 1
striking 1
and 1
bizarre 1
without 1
being 1
criminal 1
We 1
have 1
already 1
had 1
experience 1
of 1
such 1
So 1
much 1
so 1
I 1
remarked 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
last 1
six 1
cases 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
added 1
to 1
my 1
notes 1
three 1
have 1
been 1
entirely 1
free 1
of 1
any 1
legal 1
crime 1
Precisely 1
You 1
allude 1
to 1
my 1
attempt 1
to 1
recover 1
the 1
Irene 1
Adler 1
papers 1
to 1
the 1
singular 1
case 1
of 1
Miss 1
Mary 1
Sutherland 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
adventure 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
with 1
the 1
twisted 1
lip 1
Well 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
this 1
small 1
matter 1
will 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
same 1
innocent 1
category 1
You 1
know 1
Peterson 1
the 1
commissionaire 1
Yes 1
It 1
is 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
this 1
trophy 1
belongs 1
It 1
is 1
his 1
hat 1
No 1
no 1
he 1
found 1
it 1
Its 1
owner 1
is 1
unknown 1
I 1
beg 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
look 1
upon 1
it 1
not 1
as 1
a 1
battered 1
billycock 1
but 1
as 1
an 1
intellectual 1
problem 1
And 1
first 1
as 1
to 1
how 1
it 1
came 1
here 1
It 1
arrived 1
upon 1
Christmas 1
morning 1
in 1
company 1
with 1
a 1
good 1
fat 1
goose 1
which 1
is 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
roasting 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
Peterson 1
s 1
fire 1
The 1
facts 1
are 1
these 1
about 1
four 1
o 1
clock 1
on 1
Christmas 1
morning 1
Peterson 1
who 1
as 1
you 1
know 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
honest 1
fellow 1
was 1
returning 1
from 1
some 1
small 1
jollification 1
and 1
was 1
making 1
his 1
way 1
homeward 1
down 1
Tottenham 1
Court 1
Road 1
In 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
he 1
saw 1
in 1
the 1
gaslight 1
a 1
tallish 1
man 1
walking 1
with 1
a 1
slight 1
stagger 1
and 1
carrying 1
a 1
white 1
goose 1
slung 1
over 1
his 1
shoulder 1
As 1
he 1
reached 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
Goodge 1
Street 1
a 1
row 1
broke 1
out 1
between 1
this 1
stranger 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
knot 1
of 1
roughs 1
One 1
of 1
the 1
latter 1
knocked 1
off 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
hat 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
raised 1
his 1
stick 1
to 1
defend 1
himself 1
and 1
swinging 1
it 1
over 1
his 1
head 1
smashed 1
the 1
shop 1
window 1
behind 1
him 1
Peterson 1
had 1
rushed 1
forward 1
to 1
protect 1
the 1
stranger 1
from 1
his 1
assailants 1
but 1
the 1
man 1
shocked 1
at 1
having 1
broken 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
seeing 1
an 1
official 1
looking 1
person 1
in 1
uniform 1
rushing 1
towards 1
him 1
dropped 1
his 1
goose 1
took 1
to 1
his 1
heels 1
and 1
vanished 1
amid 1
the 1
labyrinth 1
of 1
small 1
streets 1
which 1
lie 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
Tottenham 1
Court 1
Road 1
The 1
roughs 1
had 1
also 1
fled 1
at 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
Peterson 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
left 1
in 1
possession 1
of 1
the 1
field 1
of 1
battle 1
and 1
also 1
of 1
the 1
spoils 1
of 1
victory 1
in 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
this 1
battered 1
hat 1
and 1
a 1
most 1
unimpeachable 1
Christmas 1
goose 1
Which 1
surely 1
he 1
restored 1
to 1
their 1
owner 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
there 1
lies 1
the 1
problem 1
It 1
is 1
true 1
that 1
For 1
Mrs 1
Henry 1
Baker 1
was 1
printed 1
upon 1
a 1
small 1
card 1
which 1
was 1
tied 1
to 1
the 1
bird 1
s 1
left 1
leg 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
also 1
true 1
that 1
the 1
initials 1
H 1
B 1
are 1
legible 1
upon 1
the 1
lining 1
of 1
this 1
hat 1
but 1
as 1
there 1
are 1
some 1
thousands 1
of 1
Bakers 1
and 1
some 1
hundreds 1
of 1
Henry 1
Bakers 1
in 1
this 1
city 1
of 1
ours 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
easy 1
to 1
restore 1
lost 1
property 1
to 1
any 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
What 1
then 1
did 1
Peterson 1
do 1
He 1
brought 1
round 1
both 1
hat 1
and 1
goose 1
to 1
me 1
on 1
Christmas 1
morning 1
knowing 1
that 1
even 1
the 1
smallest 1
problems 1
are 1
of 1
interest 1
to 1
me 1
The 1
goose 1
we 1
retained 1
until 1
this 1
morning 1
when 1
there 1
were 1
signs 1
that 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
slight 1
frost 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
well 1
that 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
eaten 1
without 1
unnecessary 1
delay 1
Its 1
finder 1
has 1
carried 1
it 1
off 1
therefore 1
to 1
fulfil 1
the 1
ultimate 1
destiny 1
of 1
a 1
goose 1
while 1
I 1
continue 1
to 1
retain 1
the 1
hat 1
of 1
the 1
unknown 1
gentleman 1
who 1
lost 1
his 1
Christmas 1
dinner 1
Did 1
he 1
not 1
advertise 1
No 1
Then 1
what 1
clue 1
could 1
you 1
have 1
as 1
to 1
his 1
identity 1
Only 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
we 1
can 1
deduce 1
From 1
his 1
hat 1
Precisely 1
But 1
you 1
are 1
joking 1
What 1
can 1
you 1
gather 1
from 1
this 1
old 1
battered 1
felt 1
Here 1
is 1
my 1
lens 1
You 1
know 1
my 1
methods 1
What 1
can 1
you 1
gather 1
yourself 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
individuality 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
has 1
worn 1
this 1
article 1
I 1
took 1
the 1
tattered 1
object 1
in 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
turned 1
it 1
over 1
rather 1
ruefully 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
ordinary 1
black 1
hat 1
of 1
the 1
usual 1
round 1
shape 1
hard 1
and 1
much 1
the 1
worse 1
for 1
wear 1
The 1
lining 1
had 1
been 1
of 1
red 1
silk 1
but 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
discoloured 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
maker 1
s 1
name 1
but 1
as 1
Holmes 1
had 1
remarked 1
the 1
initials 1
H 1
B 1
were 1
scrawled 1
upon 1
one 1
side 1
It 1
was 1
pierced 1
in 1
the 1
brim 1
for 1
a 1
hat 1
securer 1
but 1
the 1
elastic 1
was 1
missing 1
For 1
the 1
rest 1
it 1
was 1
cracked 1
exceedingly 1
dusty 1
and 1
spotted 1
in 1
several 1
places 1
although 1
there 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
some 1
attempt 1
to 1
hide 1
the 1
discoloured 1
patches 1
by 1
smearing 1
them 1
with 1
ink 1
I 1
can 1
see 1
nothing 1
said 1
I 1
handing 1
it 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
friend 1
On 1
the 1
contrary 1
Watson 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
everything 1
You 1
fail 1
however 1
to 1
reason 1
from 1
what 1
you 1
see 1
You 1
are 1
too 1
timid 1
in 1
drawing 1
your 1
inferences 1
Then 1
pray 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
you 1
can 1
infer 1
from 1
this 1
hat 1
He 1
picked 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
gazed 1
at 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
peculiar 1
introspective 1
fashion 1
which 1
was 1
characteristic 1
of 1
him 1
It 1
is 1
perhaps 1
less 1
suggestive 1
than 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
he 1
remarked 1
and 1
yet 1
there 1
are 1
a 1
few 1
inferences 1
which 1
are 1
very 1
distinct 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
others 1
which 1
represent 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
strong 1
balance 1
of 1
probability 1
That 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
highly 1
intellectual 1
is 1
of 1
course 1
obvious 1
upon 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
also 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
fairly 1
well 1
to 1
do 1
within 1
the 1
last 1
three 1
years 1
although 1
he 1
has 1
now 1
fallen 1
upon 1
evil 1
days 1
He 1
had 1
foresight 1
but 1
has 1
less 1
now 1
than 1
formerly 1
pointing 1
to 1
a 1
moral 1
retrogression 1
which 1
when 1
taken 1
with 1
the 1
decline 1
of 1
his 1
fortunes 1
seems 1
to 1
indicate 1
some 1
evil 1
influence 1
probably 1
drink 1
at 1
work 1
upon 1
him 1
This 1
may 1
account 1
also 1
for 1
the 1
obvious 1
fact 1
that 1
his 1
wife 1
has 1
ceased 1
to 1
love 1
him 1
My 1
dear 1
Holmes 1
He 1
has 1
however 1
retained 1
some 1
degree 1
of 1
self 1
respect 1
he 1
continued 1
disregarding 1
my 1
remonstrance 1
He 1
is 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
leads 1
a 1
sedentary 1
life 1
goes 1
out 1
little 1
is 1
out 1
of 1
training 1
entirely 1
is 1
middle 1
aged 1
has 1
grizzled 1
hair 1
which 1
he 1
has 1
had 1
cut 1
within 1
the 1
last 1
few 1
days 1
and 1
which 1
he 1
anoints 1
with 1
lime 1
cream 1
These 1
are 1
the 1
more 1
patent 1
facts 1
which 1
are 1
to 1
be 1
deduced 1
from 1
his 1
hat 1
Also 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
extremely 1
improbable 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
gas 1
laid 1
on 1
in 1
his 1
house 1
You 1
are 1
certainly 1
joking 1
Holmes 1
Not 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
Is 1
it 1
possible 1
that 1
even 1
now 1
when 1
I 1
give 1
you 1
these 1
results 1
you 1
are 1
unable 1
to 1
see 1
how 1
they 1
are 1
attained 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
stupid 1
but 1
I 1
must 1
confess 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
unable 1
to 1
follow 1
you 1
For 1
example 1
how 1
did 1
you 1
deduce 1
that 1
this 1
man 1
was 1
intellectual 1
For 1
answer 1
Holmes 1
clapped 1
the 1
hat 1
upon 1
his 1
head 1
It 1
came 1
right 1
over 1
the 1
forehead 1
and 1
settled 1
upon 1
the 1
bridge 1
of 1
his 1
nose 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
question 1
of 1
cubic 1
capacity 1
said 1
he 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
so 1
large 1
a 1
brain 1
must 1
have 1
something 1
in 1
it 1
The 1
decline 1
of 1
his 1
fortunes 1
then 1
This 1
hat 1
is 1
three 1
years 1
old 1
These 1
flat 1
brims 1
curled 1
at 1
the 1
edge 1
came 1
in 1
then 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
hat 1
of 1
the 1
very 1
best 1
quality 1
Look 1
at 1
the 1
band 1
of 1
ribbed 1
silk 1
and 1
the 1
excellent 1
lining 1
If 1
this 1
man 1
could 1
afford 1
to 1
buy 1
so 1
expensive 1
a 1
hat 1
three 1
years 1
ago 1
and 1
has 1
had 1
no 1
hat 1
since 1
then 1
he 1
has 1
assuredly 1
gone 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
Well 1
that 1
is 1
clear 1
enough 1
certainly 1
But 1
how 1
about 1
the 1
foresight 1
and 1
the 1
moral 1
retrogression 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
laughed 1
Here 1
is 1
the 1
foresight 1
said 1
he 1
putting 1
his 1
finger 1
upon 1
the 1
little 1
disc 1
and 1
loop 1
of 1
the 1
hat 1
securer 1
They 1
are 1
never 1
sold 1
upon 1
hats 1
If 1
this 1
man 1
ordered 1
one 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
a 1
certain 1
amount 1
of 1
foresight 1
since 1
he 1
went 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
way 1
to 1
take 1
this 1
precaution 1
against 1
the 1
wind 1
But 1
since 1
we 1
see 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
broken 1
the 1
elastic 1
and 1
has 1
not 1
troubled 1
to 1
replace 1
it 2
is 1
obvious 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
less 1
foresight 1
now 1
than 1
formerly 1
which 1
is 1
a 1
distinct 1
proof 1
of 1
a 1
weakening 1
nature 1
On 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
he 1
has 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
conceal 1
some 1
of 1
these 1
stains 1
upon 1
the 1
felt 1
by 1
daubing 1
them 1
with 1
ink 1
which 1
is 1
a 1
sign 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
not 1
entirely 1
lost 1
his 1
self 1
respect 1
Your 1
reasoning 1
is 1
certainly 1
plausible 1
The 1
further 1
points 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
middle 1
aged 1
that 1
his 1
hair 1
is 1
grizzled 1
that 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
recently 1
cut 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
uses 1
lime 1
cream 1
are 1
all 1
to 1
be 1
gathered 1
from 1
a 1
close 1
examination 1
of 1
the 1
lower 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
lining 1
The 1
lens 1
discloses 1
a 1
large 1
number 1
of 1
hair 1
ends 1
clean 1
cut 1
by 1
the 1
scissors 1
of 1
the 1
barber 1
They 1
all 1
appear 1
to 1
be 1
adhesive 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
distinct 1
odour 1
of 1
lime 1
cream 1
This 1
dust 1
you 1
will 1
observe 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
gritty 1
grey 1
dust 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
but 1
the 1
fluffy 1
brown 1
dust 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
showing 1
that 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
hung 1
up 1
indoors 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
while 1
the 1
marks 1
of 1
moisture 1
upon 1
the 1
inside 1
are 1
proof 1
positive 1
that 1
the 1
wearer 1
perspired 1
very 1
freely 1
and 1
could 1
therefore 1
hardly 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
training 1
But 1
his 1
wife 1
you 1
said 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
love 1
him 1
This 1
hat 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
brushed 1
for 1
weeks 1
When 1
I 1
see 1
you 1
my 1
dear 1
Watson 1
with 1
a 1
week 1
s 1
accumulation 1
of 1
dust 1
upon 1
your 1
hat 1
and 1
when 1
your 1
wife 1
allows 1
you 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
state 1
I 1
shall 1
fear 1
that 1
you 1
also 1
have 1
been 1
unfortunate 1
enough 1
to 1
lose 1
your 1
wife 1
s 1
affection 1
But 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
bachelor 1
Nay 1
he 1
was 1
bringing 1
home 1
the 1
goose 1
as 1
a 1
peace 1
offering 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1
Remember 1
the 1
card 1
upon 1
the 1
bird 1
s 1
leg 1
You 1
have 1
an 1
answer 1
to 1
everything 1
But 1
how 1
on 1
earth 1
do 1
you 1
deduce 1
that 1
the 1
gas 1
is 1
not 1
laid 1
on 1
in 1
his 1
house 1
One 1
tallow 1
stain 1
or 1
even 1
two 1
might 1
come 1
by 1
chance 1
but 1
when 1
I 1
see 1
no 1
less 1
than 1
five 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
there 1
can 1
be 1
little 1
doubt 1
that 1
the 1
individual 1
must 1
be 1
brought 1
into 1
frequent 1
contact 1
with 1
burning 1
tallow 1
walks 1
upstairs 1
at 1
night 1
probably 1
with 1
his 1
hat 1
in 1
one 1
hand 1
and 1
a 1
guttering 1
candle 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
Anyhow 1
he 1
never 1
got 1
tallow 1
stains 1
from 1
a 1
gas 1
jet 1
Are 1
you 1
satisfied 1
Well 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
ingenious 1
said 1
I 1
laughing 1
but 1
since 1
as 1
you 1
said 1
just 1
now 1
there 1
has 1
been 1
no 1
crime 1
committed 1
and 1
no 1
harm 1
done 1
save 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
a 1
goose 1
all 1
this 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
rather 1
a 1
waste 1
of 1
energy 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
had 1
opened 1
his 1
mouth 1
to 1
reply 1
when 1
the 1
door 1
flew 1
open 1
and 1
Peterson 1
the 1
commissionaire 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
apartment 1
with 1
flushed 1
cheeks 1
and 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
dazed 1
with 1
astonishment 1
The 1
goose 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
The 1
goose 1
sir 1
he 1
gasped 1
Eh 1
What 1
of 1
it 1
then 1
Has 1
it 1
returned 1
to 1
life 1
and 1
flapped 1
off 1
through 1
the 1
kitchen 1
window 1
Holmes 1
twisted 1
himself 1
round 1
upon 1
the 1
sofa 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
fairer 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
excited 1
face 1
See 1
here 1
sir 1
See 1
what 1
my 1
wife 1
found 1
in 1
its 1
crop 1
He 1
held 1
out 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
displayed 1
upon 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
palm 1
a 1
brilliantly 1
scintillating 1
blue 1
stone 1
rather 1
smaller 1
than 1
a 1
bean 1
in 1
size 1
but 1
of 1
such 1
purity 1
and 1
radiance 1
that 1
it 1
twinkled 1
like 1
an 1
electric 1
point 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
hollow 1
of 1
his 1
hand 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
sat 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
whistle 1
By 1
Jove 1
Peterson 1
said 1
he 1
this 1
is 1
treasure 1
trove 1
indeed 1
I 1
suppose 1
you 1
know 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
got 1
A 1
diamond 1
sir 1
A 1
precious 1
stone 1
It 1
cuts 1
into 1
glass 1
as 1
though 1
it 1
were 1
putty 1
It 1
s 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
precious 1
stone 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
precious 1
stone 1
Not 1
the 1
Countess 1
of 1
Morcar 1
s 1
blue 1
carbuncle 1
I 1
ejaculated 1
Precisely 1
so 1
I 1
ought 1
to 1
know 1
its 1
size 1
and 1
shape 1
seeing 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
read 1
the 1
advertisement 1
about 1
it 1
in 1
The 1
Times 1
every 1
day 1
lately 1
It 1
is 1
absolutely 1
unique 1
and 1
its 1
value 1
can 1
only 1
be 1
conjectured 1
but 1
the 1
reward 1
offered 1
of 1
pounds 1
is 1
certainly 1
not 1
within 1
a 1
twentieth 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
market 1
price 1
A 1
thousand 1
pounds 1
Great 1
Lord 1
of 1
mercy 1
The 1
commissionaire 1
plumped 1
down 1
into 1
a 1
chair 1
and 1
stared 1
from 1
one 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
of 1
us 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
reward 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
reason 1
to 1
know 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
sentimental 1
considerations 1
in 1
the 1
background 1
which 1
would 1
induce 1
the 1
Countess 1
to 1
part 1
with 1
half 1
her 1
fortune 1
if 1
she 1
could 1
but 1
recover 1
the 1
gem 1
It 1
was 1
lost 1
if 1
I 1
remember 1
aright 1
at 1
the 1
Hotel 1
Cosmopolitan 1
I 1
remarked 1
Precisely 1
so 1
on 1
December 1
nd 1
just 1
five 1
days 1
ago 1
John 1
Horner 1
a 1
plumber 1
was 1
accused 1
of 1
having 1
abstracted 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
lady 1
s 1
jewel 1
case 1
The 1
evidence 1
against 1
him 1
was 1
so 1
strong 1
that 1
the 1
case 1
has 1
been 1
referred 1
to 1
the 1
Assizes 1
I 1
have 1
some 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
here 1
I 1
believe 1
He 1
rummaged 1
amid 1
his 1
newspapers 1
glancing 1
over 1
the 1
dates 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
smoothed 1
one 1
out 1
doubled 1
it 1
over 1
and 1
read 1
the 1
following 1
paragraph 1
Hotel 1
Cosmopolitan 1
Jewel 1
Robbery 1
John 1
Horner 1
plumber 1
was 1
brought 1
up 1
upon 1
the 1
charge 1
of 1
having 1
upon 1
the 1
nd 1
inst 1
abstracted 1
from 1
the 1
jewel 1
case 1
of 1
the 1
Countess 1
of 1
Morcar 1
the 1
valuable 1
gem 1
known 1
as 1
the 1
blue 1
carbuncle 1
James 1
Ryder 1
upper 1
attendant 1
at 1
the 1
hotel 1
gave 1
his 1
evidence 1
to 1
the 1
effect 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
shown 1
Horner 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
dressing 1
room 1
of 1
the 1
Countess 1
of 1
Morcar 1
upon 1
the 1
day 1
of 1
the 1
robbery 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
solder 1
the 1
second 1
bar 1
of 1
the 1
grate 1
which 1
was 1
loose 1
He 1
had 1
remained 1
with 1
Horner 1
some 1
little 1
time 1
but 1
had 1
finally 1
been 1
called 1
away 1
On 1
returning 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
Horner 1
had 1
disappeared 1
that 1
the 1
bureau 1
had 1
been 1
forced 1
open 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
small 1
morocco 1
casket 1
in 1
which 1
as 1
it 1
afterwards 1
transpired 1
the 1
Countess 1
was 1
accustomed 1
to 1
keep 1
her 1
jewel 1
was 1
lying 1
empty 1
upon 1
the 1
dressing 1
table 1
Ryder 1
instantly 1
gave 1
the 1
alarm 1
and 1
Horner 1
was 1
arrested 1
the 1
same 1
evening 1
but 1
the 1
stone 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
found 1
either 1
upon 1
his 1
person 1
or 1
in 1
his 1
rooms 1
Catherine 1
Cusack 1
maid 1
to 1
the 1
Countess 1
deposed 1
to 1
having 1
heard 1
Ryder 1
s 1
cry 1
of 1
dismay 1
on 1
discovering 1
the 1
robbery 1
and 1
to 1
having 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
she 1
found 1
matters 1
as 1
described 1
by 1
the 1
last 1
witness 1
Inspector 1
Bradstreet 1
B 1
division 1
gave 1
evidence 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
arrest 1
of 1
Horner 1
who 1
struggled 1
frantically 1
and 1
protested 1
his 1
innocence 1
in 1
the 1
strongest 1
terms 1
Evidence 1
of 1
a 1
previous 1
conviction 1
for 1
robbery 1
having 1
been 1
given 1
against 1
the 1
prisoner 1
the 1
magistrate 1
refused 1
to 1
deal 1
summarily 1
with 1
the 1
offence 1
but 1
referred 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
Assizes 1
Horner 1
who 1
had 1
shown 1
signs 1
of 1
intense 1
emotion 1
during 1
the 1
proceedings 1
fainted 1
away 1
at 1
the 1
conclusion 1
and 1
was 1
carried 1
out 1
of 1
court 1
Hum 1
So 1
much 1
for 1
the 1
police 1
court 1
said 1
Holmes 1
thoughtfully 1
tossing 1
aside 1
the 1
paper 1
The 1
question 1
for 1
us 1
now 1
to 1
solve 1
is 1
the 1
sequence 1
of 1
events 1
leading 1
from 1
a 1
rifled 1
jewel 1
case 1
at 1
one 1
end 1
to 1
the 1
crop 1
of 1
a 1
goose 1
in 1
Tottenham 1
Court 1
Road 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
You 1
see 1
Watson 1
our 1
little 1
deductions 1
have 1
suddenly 1
assumed 1
a 1
much 1
more 1
important 1
and 1
less 1
innocent 1
aspect 1
Here 1
is 1
the 1
stone 1
the 1
stone 1
came 1
from 1
the 1
goose 1
and 1
the 1
goose 1
came 1
from 1
Mr 1
Henry 1
Baker 1
the 1
gentleman 1
with 1
the 1
bad 1
hat 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
characteristics 1
with 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
bored 1
you 1
So 1
now 1
we 1
must 1
set 1
ourselves 1
very 1
seriously 1
to 1
finding 1
this 1
gentleman 1
and 1
ascertaining 1
what 1
part 1
he 1
has 1
played 1
in 1
this 1
little 1
mystery 1
To 1
do 1
this 1
we 1
must 1
try 1
the 1
simplest 1
means 1
first 1
and 1
these 1
lie 1
undoubtedly 1
in 1
an 1
advertisement 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
evening 1
papers 1
If 1
this 1
fail 1
I 1
shall 1
have 1
recourse 1
to 1
other 1
methods 1
What 1
will 1
you 1
say 1
Give 1
me 1
a 1
pencil 1
and 1
that 1
slip 1
of 1
paper 1
Now 1
then 1
Found 1
at 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
Goodge 1
Street 1
a 1
goose 1
and 1
a 1
black 1
felt 1
hat 1
Mr 1
Henry 1
Baker 1
can 1
have 1
the 1
same 1
by 1
applying 1
at 1
this 1
evening 1
at 1
B 1
Baker 1
Street 1
That 1
is 1
clear 1
and 1
concise 1
Very 1
But 1
will 1
he 1
see 1
it 1
Well 1
he 1
is 1
sure 1
to 1
keep 1
an 1
eye 1
on 1
the 1
papers 1
since 1
to 1
a 1
poor 1
man 1
the 1
loss 1
was 1
a 1
heavy 1
one 1
He 1
was 1
clearly 1
so 1
scared 1
by 1
his 1
mischance 1
in 1
breaking 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
approach 1
of 1
Peterson 1
that 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
nothing 1
but 1
flight 1
but 1
since 1
then 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
bitterly 1
regretted 1
the 1
impulse 1
which 1
caused 1
him 1
to 1
drop 1
his 1
bird 1
Then 1
again 1
the 1
introduction 1
of 1
his 1
name 1
will 1
cause 1
him 1
to 1
see 1
it 1
for 1
everyone 1
who 1
knows 1
him 1
will 1
direct 1
his 1
attention 1
to 1
it 1
Here 1
you 1
are 1
Peterson 1
run 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
advertising 1
agency 1
and 1
have 1
this 1
put 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
papers 1
In 1
which 1
sir 1
Oh 1
in 1
the 1
Globe 1
Star 1
Pall 1
Mall 1
St 1
James 1
s 1
Evening 1
News 1
Standard 1
Echo 1
and 1
any 1
others 1
that 1
occur 1
to 1
you 1
Very 1
well 1
sir 1
And 1
this 1
stone 1
Ah 1
yes 1
I 1
shall 1
keep 1
the 1
stone 1
Thank 1
you 1
And 1
I 1
say 1
Peterson 1
just 1
buy 1
a 1
goose 1
on 1
your 1
way 1
back 1
and 1
leave 1
it 1
here 1
with 1
me 1
for 1
we 1
must 1
have 1
one 1
to 1
give 1
to 1
this 1
gentleman 1
in 1
place 1
of 1
the 1
one 1
which 1
your 1
family 1
is 1
now 1
devouring 1
When 1
the 1
commissionaire 1
had 1
gone 1
Holmes 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
stone 1
and 1
held 1
it 1
against 1
the 1
light 1
It 1
s 1
a 1
bonny 1
thing 1
said 1
he 1
Just 1
see 1
how 1
it 1
glints 1
and 1
sparkles 1
Of 1
course 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
nucleus 1
and 1
focus 1
of 1
crime 1
Every 1
good 1
stone 1
is 1
They 1
are 1
the 1
devil 1
s 1
pet 1
baits 1
In 1
the 1
larger 1
and 1
older 1
jewels 1
every 1
facet 1
may 1
stand 1
for 1
a 1
bloody 1
deed 1
This 1
stone 1
is 1
not 1
yet 1
twenty 1
years 1
old 1
It 1
was 1
found 1
in 1
the 1
banks 1
of 1
the 1
Amoy 1
River 1
in 1
southern 1
China 1
and 1
is 1
remarkable 1
in 1
having 1
every 1
characteristic 1
of 1
the 1
carbuncle 1
save 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
blue 1
in 1
shade 1
instead 1
of 1
ruby 1
red 1
In 1
spite 1
of 1
its 1
youth 1
it 1
has 1
already 1
a 1
sinister 1
history 1
There 1
have 1
been 1
two 1
murders 1
a 1
vitriol 1
throwing 1
a 1
suicide 1
and 1
several 1
robberies 1
brought 1
about 1
for 1
the 1
sake 1
of 1
this 1
forty 1
grain 1
weight 1
of 1
crystallised 1
charcoal 1
Who 1
would 1
think 1
that 1
so 1
pretty 1
a 1
toy 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
purveyor 1
to 1
the 1
gallows 1
and 1
the 1
prison 1
I 1
ll 1
lock 1
it 1
up 1
in 1
my 1
strong 1
box 1
now 1
and 1
drop 1
a 1
line 1
to 1
the 1
Countess 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
it 1
Do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
this 1
man 1
Horner 1
is 1
innocent 1
I 1
cannot 1
tell 1
Well 1
then 1
do 1
you 1
imagine 1
that 1
this 1
other 1
one 1
Henry 1
Baker 1
had 1
anything 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
the 1
matter 1
It 1
is 1
I 1
think 1
much 1
more 1
likely 1
that 1
Henry 1
Baker 1
is 1
an 1
absolutely 1
innocent 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
that 1
the 1
bird 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
carrying 1
was 1
of 1
considerably 1
more 1
value 1
than 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
made 1
of 1
solid 1
gold 1
That 1
however 1
I 1
shall 1
determine 1
by 1
a 1
very 1
simple 1
test 1
if 1
we 1
have 1
an 1
answer 1
to 1
our 1
advertisement 1
And 1
you 1
can 1
do 1
nothing 1
until 1
then 1
Nothing 1
In 1
that 1
case 1
I 1
shall 1
continue 1
my 1
professional 1
round 1
But 1
I 1
shall 1
come 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
at 1
the 1
hour 1
you 1
have 1
mentioned 1
for 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
solution 1
of 1
so 1
tangled 1
a 1
business 1
Very 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
I 1
dine 1
at 1
seven 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
woodcock 1
I 1
believe 1
By 1
the 1
way 1
in 1
view 1
of 1
recent 1
occurrences 1
perhaps 1
I 1
ought 1
to 1
ask 1
Mrs 1
Hudson 1
to 1
examine 1
its 1
crop 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
delayed 1
at 1
a 1
case 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
after 1
half 1
past 1
six 1
when 1
I 1
found 1
myself 1
in 1
Baker 1
Street 1
once 1
more 1
As 1
I 1
approached 1
the 1
house 1
I 1
saw 1
a 1
tall 1
man 1
in 1
a 1
Scotch 1
bonnet 1
with 1
a 1
coat 1
which 1
was 1
buttoned 1
up 1
to 1
his 1
chin 1
waiting 1
outside 1
in 1
the 1
bright 1
semicircle 1
which 1
was 1
thrown 1
from 1
the 1
fanlight 1
Just 1
as 1
I 1
arrived 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
opened 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
shown 1
up 1
together 1
to 1
Holmes 1
room 1
Mr 1
Henry 1
Baker 1
I 1
believe 1
said 1
he 1
rising 1
from 1
his 1
armchair 1
and 1
greeting 1
his 1
visitor 1
with 1
the 1
easy 1
air 1
of 1
geniality 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
so 1
readily 1
assume 1
Pray 1
take 1
this 1
chair 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
Mr 1
Baker 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
cold 1
night 1
and 1
I 1
observe 1
that 1
your 1
circulation 1
is 1
more 1
adapted 1
for 1
summer 1
than 1
for 1
winter 1
Ah 1
Watson 1
you 1
have 1
just 1
come 1
at 1
the 1
right 1
time 1
Is 1
that 1
your 1
hat 1
Mr 1
Baker 1
Yes 1
sir 1
that 1
is 1
undoubtedly 1
my 1
hat 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
large 1
man 1
with 1
rounded 1
shoulders 1
a 1
massive 1
head 1
and 1
a 1
broad 1
intelligent 1
face 1
sloping 1
down 1
to 1
a 1
pointed 1
beard 1
of 1
grizzled 1
brown 1
A 1
touch 1
of 1
red 1
in 1
nose 1
and 1
cheeks 1
with 1
a 1
slight 1
tremor 1
of 1
his 1
extended 1
hand 1
recalled 1
Holmes 1
surmise 1
as 1
to 1
his 1
habits 1
His 1
rusty 1
black 1
frock 1
coat 1
was 1
buttoned 1
right 1
up 1
in 1
front 1
with 1
the 1
collar 1
turned 1
up 1
and 1
his 1
lank 1
wrists 1
protruded 1
from 1
his 1
sleeves 1
without 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
cuff 1
or 1
shirt 1
He 1
spoke 1
in 1
a 1
slow 1
staccato 1
fashion 1
choosing 1
his 1
words 1
with 1
care 1
and 1
gave 1
the 1
impression 1
generally 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
learning 1
and 1
letters 1
who 1
had 2
ill 1
usage 1
at 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
fortune 1
We 1
have 1
retained 1
these 1
things 1
for 1
some 1
days 1
said 1
Holmes 1
because 1
we 1
expected 1
to 1
see 1
an 1
advertisement 1
from 1
you 1
giving 1
your 1
address 1
I 1
am 1
at 1
a 1
loss 1
to 1
know 1
now 1
why 1
you 1
did 1
not 1
advertise 1
Our 1
visitor 1
gave 1
a 1
rather 1
shamefaced 1
laugh 1
Shillings 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
so 1
plentiful 1
with 1
me 1
as 1
they 1
once 1
were 1
he 1
remarked 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
the 1
gang 1
of 1
roughs 1
who 1
assaulted 1
me 1
had 1
carried 1
off 1
both 1
my 1
hat 1
and 1
the 1
bird 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
care 1
to 1
spend 1
more 1
money 1
in 1
a 1
hopeless 1
attempt 1
at 1
recovering 1
them 1
Very 1
naturally 1
By 1
the 1
way 1
about 1
the 1
bird 1
we 1
were 1
compelled 1
to 1
eat 1
it 1
To 1
eat 1
it 1
Our 1
visitor 1
half 1
rose 1
from 1
his 1
chair 1
in 1
his 1
excitement 1
Yes 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
anyone 1
had 1
we 1
not 1
done 1
so 1
But 1
I 1
presume 1
that 1
this 1
other 1
goose 1
upon 1
the 1
sideboard 1
which 1
is 1
about 1
the 1
same 1
weight 1
and 1
perfectly 1
fresh 1
will 1
answer 1
your 1
purpose 1
equally 1
well 1
Oh 1
certainly 2
answered 1
Mr 1
Baker 1
with 1
a 1
sigh 1
of 1
relief 1
Of 1
course 1
we 1
still 1
have 1
the 1
feathers 1
legs 1
crop 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
of 1
your 1
own 1
bird 1
so 1
if 1
you 1
wish 1
The 1
man 1
burst 1
into 1
a 1
hearty 1
laugh 1
They 1
might 1
be 1
useful 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
relics 1
of 1
my 1
adventure 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
beyond 1
that 1
I 1
can 1
hardly 1
see 1
what 1
use 1
the 1
disjecta 1
membra 1
of 1
my 1
late 1
acquaintance 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
to 1
me 1
No 1
sir 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
with 1
your 1
permission 1
I 1
will 1
confine 1
my 1
attentions 1
to 1
the 1
excellent 1
bird 1
which 1
I 1
perceive 1
upon 1
the 1
sideboard 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
glanced 1
sharply 1
across 1
at 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
slight 1
shrug 1
of 1
his 1
shoulders 1
There 1
is 1
your 1
hat 1
then 1
and 1
there 1
your 1
bird 1
said 1
he 1
By 1
the 1
way 1
would 1
it 1
bore 1
you 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
where 1
you 1
got 1
the 1
other 1
one 1
from 1
I 1
am 1
somewhat 1
of 1
a 1
fowl 1
fancier 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
seldom 1
seen 1
a 1
better 1
grown 1
goose 1
Certainly 1
sir 1
said 1
Baker 1
who 1
had 1
risen 1
and 1
tucked 1
his 1
newly 1
gained 1
property 1
under 1
his 1
arm 1
There 1
are 1
a 1
few 1
of 1
us 1
who 1
frequent 1
the 1
Alpha 1
Inn 1
near 1
the 1
Museum 1
we 1
are 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
in 1
the 1
Museum 1
itself 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
you 1
understand 1
This 1
year 1
our 1
good 1
host 1
Windigate 1
by 1
name 1
instituted 1
a 1
goose 1
club 1
by 1
which 1
on 1
consideration 1
of 1
some 1
few 1
pence 1
every 1
week 1
we 1
were 1
each 1
to 1
receive 1
a 1
bird 1
at 1
Christmas 1
My 1
pence 1
were 1
duly 1
paid 1
and 1
the 1
rest 1
is 1
familiar 1
to 1
you 1
I 1
am 1
much 1
indebted 1
to 1
you 1
sir 1
for 1
a 1
Scotch 1
bonnet 1
is 1
fitted 1
neither 1
to 1
my 1
years 1
nor 1
my 1
gravity 1
With 1
a 1
comical 1
pomposity 1
of 1
manner 1
he 1
bowed 1
solemnly 1
to 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
and 1
strode 1
off 1
upon 1
his 1
way 1
So 1
much 1
for 1
Mr 1
Henry 1
Baker 1
said 1
Holmes 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
closed 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
him 1
It 1
is 1
quite 1
certain 1
that 1
he 1
knows 1
nothing 1
whatever 1
about 1
the 1
matter 1
Are 1
you 1
hungry 1
Watson 1
Not 1
particularly 1
Then 1
I 1
suggest 1
that 1
we 1
turn 1
our 1
dinner 1
into 1
a 1
supper 1
and 1
follow 1
up 1
this 1
clue 1
while 1
it 1
is 1
still 1
hot 1
By 1
all 1
means 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
bitter 1
night 1
so 1
we 1
drew 1
on 1
our 1
ulsters 1
and 1
wrapped 1
cravats 1
about 1
our 1
throats 1
Outside 1
the 1
stars 1
were 1
shining 1
coldly 1
in 1
a 1
cloudless 1
sky 1
and 1
the 1
breath 1
of 1
the 1
passers 1
by 1
blew 1
out 1
into 1
smoke 1
like 1
so 1
many 1
pistol 1
shots 1
Our 1
footfalls 1
rang 1
out 1
crisply 1
and 1
loudly 1
as 1
we 1
swung 1
through 1
the 1
doctors 1
quarter 1
Wimpole 1
Street 1
Harley 1
Street 1
and 1
so 1
through 1
Wigmore 1
Street 1
into 1
Oxford 1
Street 1
In 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
we 1
were 1
in 1
Bloomsbury 1
at 1
the 1
Alpha 1
Inn 1
which 1
is 1
a 1
small 1
public 1
house 1
at 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
streets 1
which 1
runs 1
down 1
into 1
Holborn 1
Holmes 1
pushed 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
private 1
bar 1
and 1
ordered 1
two 1
glasses 1
of 1
beer 1
from 1
the 1
ruddy 1
faced 1
white 1
aproned 1
landlord 1
Your 1
beer 1
should 1
be 1
excellent 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
your 1
geese 1
said 1
he 1
My 1
geese 1
The 1
man 1
seemed 1
surprised 1
Yes 1
I 1
was 1
speaking 1
only 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
ago 1
to 1
Mr 1
Henry 1
Baker 1
who 1
was 1
a 1
member 1
of 1
your 1
goose 1
club 1
Ah 1
yes 1
I 1
see 1
But 1
you 1
see 1
sir 1
them 1
s 1
not 1
our 1
geese 1
Indeed 1
Whose 1
then 1
Well 1
I 1
got 1
the 1
two 1
dozen 1
from 1
a 1
salesman 1
in 1
Covent 1
Garden 1
Indeed 1
I 1
know 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
Which 1
was 1
it 1
Breckinridge 1
is 1
his 1
name 1
Ah 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
him 1
Well 1
here 1
s 1
your 1
good 1
health 1
landlord 1
and 1
prosperity 1
to 1
your 1
house 1
Good 1
night 1
Now 1
for 1
Mr 1
Breckinridge 1
he 1
continued 1
buttoning 1
up 1
his 1
coat 1
as 1
we 1
came 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
frosty 1
air 1
Remember 1
Watson 1
that 1
though 1
we 1
have 1
so 1
homely 1
a 1
thing 1
as 1
a 1
goose 1
at 1
one 1
end 1
of 1
this 1
chain 1
we 1
have 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
will 1
certainly 1
get 1
seven 1
years 1
penal 1
servitude 1
unless 1
we 1
can 1
establish 1
his 1
innocence 1
It 1
is 1
possible 1
that 1
our 1
inquiry 1
may 1
but 1
confirm 1
his 1
guilt 1
but 1
in 1
any 1
case 1
we 1
have 1
a 1
line 1
of 1
investigation 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
missed 1
by 1
the 1
police 1
and 1
which 1
a 1
singular 1
chance 1
has 1
placed 1
in 1
our 1
hands 1
Let 1
us 1
follow 1
it 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
bitter 1
end 1
Faces 1
to 1
the 1
south 1
then 1
and 1
quick 1
march 1
We 1
passed 1
across 1
Holborn 1
down 1
Endell 1
Street 1
and 1
so 1
through 1
a 1
zigzag 1
of 1
slums 1
to 1
Covent 1
Garden 1
Market 1
One 1
of 1
the 1
largest 1
stalls 1
bore 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
Breckinridge 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
proprietor 1
a 1
horsey 1
looking 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
sharp 1
face 1
and 1
trim 1
side 1
whiskers 1
was 1
helping 1
a 1
boy 1
to 1
put 1
up 1
the 1
shutters 1
Good 1
evening 1
It 1
s 1
a 1
cold 1
night 1
said 1
Holmes 1
The 1
salesman 1
nodded 1
and 1
shot 1
a 1
questioning 1
glance 1
at 1
my 1
companion 1
Sold 1
out 1
of 1
geese 1
I 1
see 1
continued 1
Holmes 1
pointing 1
at 1
the 1
bare 1
slabs 1
of 1
marble 1
Let 1
you 1
have 1
five 1
hundred 1
to 1
morrow 1
morning 1
That 1
s 1
no 1
good 1
Well 1
there 1
are 1
some 1
on 1
the 1
stall 1
with 1
the 1
gas 1
flare 1
Ah 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
recommended 1
to 1
you 1
Who 1
by 1
The 1
landlord 1
of 1
the 1
Alpha 1
Oh 1
yes 1
I 1
sent 1
him 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
dozen 1
Fine 1
birds 1
they 1
were 1
too 1
Now 1
where 1
did 1
you 1
get 1
them 1
from 1
To 1
my 1
surprise 1
the 1
question 1
provoked 1
a 1
burst 1
of 1
anger 1
from 1
the 1
salesman 1
Now 1
then 1
mister 1
said 1
he 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
cocked 1
and 1
his 1
arms 1
akimbo 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
driving 1
at 1
Let 1
s 1
have 1
it 1
straight 1
now 1
It 1
is 1
straight 1
enough 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
know 1
who 1
sold 1
you 1
the 1
geese 1
which 1
you 1
supplied 1
to 1
the 1
Alpha 1
Well 1
then 1
I 1
shan 1
t 1
tell 1
you 1
So 1
now 1
Oh 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
no 1
importance 1
but 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
why 1
you 1
should 1
be 1
so 1
warm 1
over 1
such 1
a 1
trifle 1
Warm 1
You 1
d 1
be 1
as 1
warm 1
maybe 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
as 1
pestered 1
as 1
I 1
am 1
When 1
I 1
pay 1
good 1
money 1
for 1
a 1
good 1
article 1
there 1
should 1
be 1
an 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
business 1
but 1
it 1
s 1
Where 1
are 1
the 1
geese 1
and 1
Who 1
did 1
you 1
sell 1
the 1
geese 1
to 1
and 1
What 1
will 1
you 1
take 1
for 1
the 1
geese 1
One 1
would 1
think 1
they 1
were 1
the 1
only 1
geese 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
hear 1
the 1
fuss 1
that 1
is 1
made 1
over 1
them 1
Well 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
connection 1
with 1
any 1
other 1
people 1
who 1
have 1
been 1
making 1
inquiries 1
said 1
Holmes 1
carelessly 1
If 1
you 1
won 1
t 1
tell 1
us 1
the 1
bet 1
is 1
off 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
But 1
I 1
m 1
always 1
ready 1
to 1
back 1
my 1
opinion 1
on 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
fowls 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
fiver 1
on 1
it 1
that 1
the 1
bird 1
I 1
ate 1
is 1
country 1
bred 1
Well 1
then 1
you 1
ve 1
lost 1
your 1
fiver 1
for 1
it 1
s 1
town 1
bred 1
snapped 1
the 1
salesman 1
It 1
s 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
I 1
say 1
it 1
is 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
believe 1
it 1
D 1
you 1
think 1
you 1
know 1
more 1
about 1
fowls 1
than 1
I 1
who 1
have 1
handled 1
them 1
ever 1
since 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
nipper 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
all 1
those 1
birds 1
that 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
Alpha 1
were 1
town 1
bred 1
You 1
ll 1
never 1
persuade 1
me 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
Will 1
you 1
bet 1
then 1
It 1
s 1
merely 1
taking 1
your 1
money 1
for 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
right 1
But 1
I 1
ll 1
have 1
a 1
sovereign 1
on 1
with 1
you 1
just 1
to 1
teach 1
you 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
obstinate 1
The 1
salesman 1
chuckled 1
grimly 1
Bring 1
me 1
the 1
books 1
Bill 1
said 1
he 1
The 1
small 1
boy 1
brought 1
round 1
a 1
small 1
thin 1
volume 1
and 1
a 1
great 1
greasy 1
backed 1
one 1
laying 1
them 1
out 1
together 1
beneath 1
the 1
hanging 1
lamp 1
Now 1
then 1
Mr 1
Cocksure 1
said 1
the 1
salesman 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
geese 1
but 1
before 1
I 1
finish 1
you 1
ll 1
find 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
still 1
one 1
left 1
in 1
my 1
shop 1
You 1
see 1
this 1
little 1
book 1
Well 1
That 1
s 1
the 1
list 1
of 1
the 1
folk 1
from 1
whom 1
I 1
buy 1
D 1
you 1
see 1
Well 1
then 1
here 1
on 1
this 1
page 1
are 1
the 1
country 1
folk 1
and 1
the 1
numbers 1
after 1
their 1
names 1
are 1
where 1
their 1
accounts 1
are 1
in 1
the 1
big 1
ledger 1
Now 1
then 1
You 1
see 1
this 1
other 1
page 1
in 1
red 1
ink 1
Well 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
list 1
of 1
my 1
town 1
suppliers 1
Now 1
look 1
at 1
that 1
third 1
name 1
Just 1
read 1
it 1
out 1
to 1
me 1
Mrs 1
Oakshott 1
Brixton 1
Road 1
read 1
Holmes 1
Quite 1
so 1
Now 1
turn 1
that 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
ledger 1
Holmes 1
turned 1
to 1
the 1
page 1
indicated 1
Here 1
you 1
are 1
Mrs 1
Oakshott 1
Brixton 1
Road 1
egg 1
and 1
poultry 1
supplier 1
Now 1
then 1
what 1
s 1
the 1
last 1
entry 1
December 1
nd 1
Twenty 1
four 1
geese 1
at 1
s 1
d 1
Quite 1
so 1
There 1
you 1
are 1
And 1
underneath 1
Sold 1
to 1
Mr 1
Windigate 1
of 1
the 1
Alpha 1
at 1
s 1
What 1
have 1
you 1
to 1
say 1
now 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
looked 1
deeply 1
chagrined 1
He 1
drew 1
a 1
sovereign 1
from 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
threw 1
it 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
slab 1
turning 1
away 1
with 1
the 1
air 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
whose 1
disgust 1
is 1
too 1
deep 1
for 1
words 1
A 1
few 1
yards 1
off 1
he 1
stopped 1
under 1
a 1
lamp 1
post 1
and 1
laughed 1
in 1
the 1
hearty 1
noiseless 1
fashion 1
which 1
was 1
peculiar 1
to 1
him 1
When 1
you 1
see 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
whiskers 1
of 1
that 1
cut 1
and 1
the 1
Pink 1
un 1
protruding 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
pocket 1
you 1
can 1
always 1
draw 1
him 1
by 1
a 1
bet 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
daresay 1
that 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
put 1
pounds 1
down 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
that 1
man 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
given 1
me 1
such 1
complete 1
information 1
as 1
was 1
drawn 1
from 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
doing 1
me 1
on 1
a 1
wager 1
Well 1
Watson 1
we 1
are 1
I 1
fancy 1
nearing 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
our 1
quest 1
and 1
the 1
only 1
point 1
which 1
remains 1
to 1
be 1
determined 1
is 1
whether 1
we 1
should 1
go 1
on 1
to 1
this 1
Mrs 1
Oakshott 1
to 1
night 1
or 1
whether 1
we 1
should 1
reserve 1
it 1
for 1
to 1
morrow 1
It 1
is 1
clear 1
from 1
what 1
that 1
surly 1
fellow 1
said 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
others 1
besides 1
ourselves 1
who 1
are 1
anxious 1
about 1
the 1
matter 1
and 1
I 1
should 1
His 1
remarks 1
were 1
suddenly 1
cut 1
short 1
by 1
a 1
loud 1
hubbub 1
which 1
broke 1
out 1
from 1
the 1
stall 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
just 1
left 1
Turning 1
round 1
we 1
saw 1
a 1
little 1
rat 1
faced 1
fellow 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
circle 1
of 1
yellow 1
light 1
which 1
was 1
thrown 1
by 1
the 1
swinging 1
lamp 1
while 1
Breckinridge 1
the 1
salesman 1
framed 1
in 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
his 1
stall 1
was 1
shaking 1
his 1
fists 1
fiercely 1
at 1
the 1
cringing 1
figure 1
I 1
ve 1
had 1
enough 1
of 1
you 1
and 1
your 1
geese 1
he 1
shouted 1
I 1
wish 1
you 1
were 1
all 1
at 1
the 1
devil 1
together 1
If 1
you 1
come 1
pestering 1
me 1
any 1
more 1
with 1
your 1
silly 1
talk 1
I 1
ll 1
set 1
the 1
dog 1
at 1
you 1
You 1
bring 1
Mrs 1
Oakshott 1
here 1
and 1
I 1
ll 1
answer 1
her 1
but 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
Did 1
I 1
buy 1
the 1
geese 1
off 1
you 1
No 1
but 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
was 1
mine 1
all 1
the 1
same 1
whined 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
Well 1
then 1
ask 1
Mrs 1
Oakshott 1
for 1
it 1
She 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
Well 1
you 1
can 1
ask 1
the 1
King 1
of 1
Proosia 1
for 1
all 1
I 1
care 1
I 1
ve 1
had 1
enough 1
of 1
it 1
Get 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
He 1
rushed 1
fiercely 1
forward 1
and 1
the 1
inquirer 1
flitted 1
away 1
into 1
the 1
darkness 1
Ha 1
this 1
may 1
save 1
us 1
a 1
visit 1
to 1
Brixton 1
Road 1
whispered 1
Holmes 1
Come 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
we 1
will 1
see 1
what 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
made 1
of 1
this 1
fellow 1
Striding 1
through 1
the 1
scattered 1
knots 1
of 1
people 1
who 1
lounged 1
round 1
the 1
flaring 1
stalls 1
my 1
companion 1
speedily 1
overtook 1
the 1
little 1
man 1
and 1
touched 1
him 1
upon 1
the 1
shoulder 1
He 1
sprang 1
round 1
and 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
in 1
the 1
gas 1
light 1
that 1
every 1
vestige 1
of 1
colour 1
had 1
been 1
driven 1
from 1
his 1
face 1
Who 1
are 1
you 1
then 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
he 1
asked 1
in 1
a 1
quavering 1
voice 1
You 1
will 1
excuse 1
me 1
said 1
Holmes 1
blandly 1
but 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
overhearing 1
the 1
questions 1
which 1
you 1
put 1
to 1
the 1
salesman 1
just 1
now 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
be 1
of 1
assistance 1
to 1
you 1
You 1
Who 1
are 1
you 1
How 1
could 1
you 1
know 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
My 1
name 1
is 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
It 1
is 1
my 1
business 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
other 1
people 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
But 1
you 1
can 1
know 1
nothing 1
of 1
this 1
Excuse 1
me 1
I 1
know 1
everything 1
of 1
it 1
You 1
are 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
trace 1
some 1
geese 1
which 1
were 1
sold 1
by 1
Mrs 1
Oakshott 1
of 1
Brixton 1
Road 1
to 1
a 1
salesman 1
named 1
Breckinridge 1
by 1
him 1
in 1
turn 1
to 1
Mr 1
Windigate 1
of 1
the 1
Alpha 1
and 1
by 1
him 1
to 1
his 1
club 1
of 1
which 1
Mr 1
Henry 1
Baker 1
is 1
a 1
member 1
Oh 1
sir 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
very 1
man 1
whom 1
I 1
have 1
longed 1
to 1
meet 1
cried 1
the 1
little 1
fellow 1
with 1
outstretched 1
hands 1
and 1
quivering 1
fingers 1
I 1
can 1
hardly 1
explain 1
to 1
you 1
how 1
interested 1
I 1
am 1
in 1
this 1
matter 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
hailed 1
a 1
four 1
wheeler 1
which 1
was 1
passing 1
In 1
that 1
case 1
we 1
had 1
better 1
discuss 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
cosy 1
room 1
rather 1
than 1
in 1
this 1
wind 1
swept 1
market 1
place 1
said 1
he 1
But 1
pray 1
tell 1
me 1
before 1
we 1
go 1
farther 1
who 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
the 1
pleasure 1
of 1
assisting 1
The 1
man 1
hesitated 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
My 1
name 1
is 1
John 1
Robinson 1
he 1
answered 1
with 1
a 1
sidelong 1
glance 1
No 1
no 1
the 1
real 1
name 1
said 1
Holmes 1
sweetly 1
It 1
is 1
always 1
awkward 1
doing 1
business 1
with 1
an 1
alias 1
A 1
flush 1
sprang 1
to 1
the 1
white 1
cheeks 1
of 1
the 1
stranger 1
Well 1
then 1
said 1
he 1
my 1
real 1
name 1
is 1
James 1
Ryder 1
Precisely 1
so 1
Head 1
attendant 1
at 1
the 1
Hotel 1
Cosmopolitan 1
Pray 1
step 1
into 1
the 1
cab 1
and 1
I 1
shall 1
soon 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
everything 1
which 1
you 1
would 1
wish 1
to 1
know 1
The 1
little 1
man 1
stood 1
glancing 1
from 1
one 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
of 1
us 1
with 1
half 1
frightened 1
half 1
hopeful 1
eyes 1
as 1
one 1
who 1
is 1
not 1
sure 1
whether 1
he 1
is 1
on 1
the 1
verge 1
of 1
a 1
windfall 1
or 1
of 1
a 1
catastrophe 1
Then 1
he 1
stepped 1
into 1
the 1
cab 1
and 1
in 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
we 1
were 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
sitting 1
room 1
at 1
Baker 1
Street 1
Nothing 1
had 1
been 1
said 1
during 1
our 1
drive 1
but 1
the 1
high 1
thin 1
breathing 1
of 1
our 1
new 1
companion 1
and 1
the 1
claspings 1
and 1
unclaspings 1
of 1
his 1
hands 1
spoke 1
of 1
the 1
nervous 1
tension 1
within 1
him 1
Here 1
we 1
are 1
said 1
Holmes 1
cheerily 1
as 1
we 1
filed 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
The 1
fire 1
looks 1
very 1
seasonable 1
in 1
this 1
weather 1
You 1
look 1
cold 1
Mr 1
Ryder 1
Pray 1
take 1
the 1
basket 1
chair 1
I 1
will 1
just 1
put 1
on 1
my 1
slippers 1
before 1
we 1
settle 1
this 1
little 1
matter 1
of 1
yours 1
Now 1
then 1
You 1
want 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
became 1
of 1
those 1
geese 1
Yes 1
sir 1
Or 1
rather 1
I 1
fancy 1
of 1
that 1
goose 1
It 1
was 1
one 1
bird 1
I 1
imagine 1
in 1
which 1
you 1
were 1
interested 1
white 1
with 1
a 1
black 1
bar 1
across 1
the 1
tail 1
Ryder 1
quivered 1
with 1
emotion 1
Oh 1
sir 1
he 1
cried 1
can 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
where 1
it 1
went 1
to 1
It 1
came 1
here 1
Here 1
Yes 1
and 1
a 1
most 1
remarkable 1
bird 1
it 1
proved 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
wonder 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
take 1
an 1
interest 1
in 1
it 1
It 1
laid 1
an 1
egg 1
after 1
it 1
was 1
dead 1
the 1
bonniest 1
brightest 1
little 1
blue 1
egg 1
that 1
ever 1
was 1
seen 1
I 1
have 1
it 1
here 1
in 1
my 1
museum 1
Our 1
visitor 1
staggered 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
and 1
clutched 1
the 1
mantelpiece 1
with 1
his 1
right 1
hand 1
Holmes 1
unlocked 1
his 1
strong 1
box 1
and 1
held 1
up 1
the 1
blue 1
carbuncle 1
which 1
shone 1
out 1
like 1
a 1
star 1
with 1
a 1
cold 1
brilliant 1
many 1
pointed 1
radiance 1
Ryder 1
stood 1
glaring 1
with 1
a 1
drawn 1
face 1
uncertain 1
whether 1
to 1
claim 1
or 1
to 1
disown 1
it 1
The 1
game 1
s 1
up 1
Ryder 1
said 1
Holmes 1
quietly 1
Hold 1
up 1
man 1
or 1
you 1
ll 1
be 1
into 1
the 1
fire 1
Give 1
him 1
an 1
arm 1
back 1
into 1
his 1
chair 1
Watson 1
He 1
s 1
not 1
got 1
blood 1
enough 1
to 1
go 1
in 1
for 1
felony 1
with 1
impunity 1
Give 1
him 1
a 1
dash 1
of 1
brandy 1
So 1
Now 1
he 1
looks 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
human 1
What 1
a 1
shrimp 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
sure 1
For 1
a 1
moment 1
he 1
had 1
staggered 1
and 1
nearly 1
fallen 1
but 1
the 1
brandy 1
brought 1
a 1
tinge 1
of 1
colour 1
into 1
his 1
cheeks 1
and 1
he 1
sat 1
staring 1
with 1
frightened 1
eyes 1
at 1
his 1
accuser 1
I 1
have 1
almost 1
every 1
link 1
in 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
proofs 1
which 1
I 1
could 1
possibly 1
need 1
so 1
there 1
is 1
little 1
which 1
you 1
need 1
tell 1
me 1
Still 1
that 1
little 1
may 1
as 1
well 1
be 1
cleared 1
up 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
case 1
complete 1
You 1
had 1
heard 1
Ryder 1
of 1
this 1
blue 1
stone 1
of 1
the 1
Countess 1
of 1
Morcar 1
s 1
It 1
was 1
Catherine 1
Cusack 1
who 1
told 1
me 1
of 1
it 1
said 1
he 1
in 1
a 1
crackling 1
voice 1
I 1
see 1
her 1
ladyship 1
s 1
waiting 1
maid 1
Well 1
the 1
temptation 1
of 1
sudden 1
wealth 1
so 1
easily 1
acquired 1
was 1
too 1
much 1
for 1
you 1
as 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
for 1
better 1
men 1
before 1
you 1
but 1
you 1
were 1
not 1
very 1
scrupulous 1
in 1
the 1
means 1
you 1
used 1
It 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
Ryder 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
the 1
making 1
of 1
a 1
very 1
pretty 1
villain 1
in 1
you 1
You 1
knew 1
that 1
this 1
man 1
Horner 1
the 1
plumber 1
had 1
been 1
concerned 1
in 1
some 1
such 1
matter 1
before 1
and 1
that 1
suspicion 1
would 1
rest 1
the 1
more 1
readily 1
upon 1
him 1
What 1
did 1
you 1
do 1
then 1
You 1
made 1
some 1
small 1
job 1
in 1
my 1
lady 1
s 1
room 1
you 1
and 1
your 1
confederate 1
Cusack 1
and 1
you 1
managed 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
the 1
man 1
sent 1
for 1
Then 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
you 1
rifled 1
the 1
jewel 1
case 1
raised 1
the 1
alarm 1
and 1
had 1
this 1
unfortunate 1
man 1
arrested 1
You 1
then 1
Ryder 1
threw 1
himself 1
down 1
suddenly 1
upon 1
the 1
rug 1
and 1
clutched 1
at 1
my 1
companion 1
s 1
knees 1
For 1
God 1
s 1
sake 1
have 1
mercy 1
he 1
shrieked 1
Think 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
Of 1
my 1
mother 1
It 1
would 1
break 1
their 1
hearts 1
I 1
never 1
went 1
wrong 1
before 1
I 1
never 1
will 1
again 1
I 1
swear 1
it 1
I 1
ll 1
swear 1
it 1
on 1
a 1
Bible 1
Oh 1
don 1
t 1
bring 1
it 1
into 1
court 1
For 1
Christ 1
s 1
sake 1
don 1
t 1
Get 1
back 1
into 1
your 1
chair 1
said 1
Holmes 1
sternly 1
It 1
is 1
very 1
well 1
to 1
cringe 1
and 1
crawl 1
now 1
but 1
you 1
thought 1
little 1
enough 1
of 1
this 1
poor 1
Horner 1
in 1
the 1
dock 1
for 1
a 1
crime 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
knew 1
nothing 1
I 1
will 1
fly 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
I 1
will 1
leave 1
the 1
country 1
sir 1
Then 1
the 1
charge 1
against 1
him 1
will 1
break 1
down 1
Hum 1
We 1
will 1
talk 1
about 1
that 1
And 1
now 1
let 1
us 1
hear 1
a 1
true 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
next 1
act 1
How 1
came 1
the 1
stone 1
into 1
the 1
goose 1
and 1
how 1
came 1
the 1
goose 1
into 1
the 1
open 1
market 1
Tell 1
us 1
the 1
truth 1
for 1
there 1
lies 1
your 1
only 1
hope 1
of 1
safety 1
Ryder 1
passed 1
his 1
tongue 1
over 1
his 1
parched 1
lips 1
I 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
it 1
just 1
as 1
it 1
happened 1
sir 1
said 1
he 1
When 1
Horner 1
had 1
been 1
arrested 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
best 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
with 1
the 1
stone 1
at 1
once 1
for 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
at 1
what 1
moment 1
the 1
police 1
might 1
not 1
take 1
it 1
into 1
their 1
heads 1
to 1
search 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
room 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
place 1
about 1
the 1
hotel 1
where 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
safe 1
I 1
went 1
out 1
as 1
if 1
on 1
some 1
commission 1
and 1
I 1
made 1
for 1
my 1
sister 1
s 1
house 1
She 1
had 1
married 1
a 1
man 1
named 1
Oakshott 1
and 1
lived 1
in 1
Brixton 1
Road 1
where 1
she 1
fattened 1
fowls 1
for 1
the 1
market 1
All 1
the 1
way 1
there 1
every 1
man 1
I 1
met 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
policeman 1
or 1
a 1
detective 1
and 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
cold 1
night 1
the 1
sweat 1
was 1
pouring 1
down 1
my 1
face 1
before 1
I 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
Brixton 1
Road 1
My 1
sister 1
asked 1
me 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
matter 1
and 1
why 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
pale 1
but 1
I 1
told 1
her 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
upset 1
by 1
the 1
jewel 1
robbery 1
at 1
the 1
hotel 1
Then 1
I 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
back 1
yard 1
and 1
smoked 1
a 1
pipe 1
and 1
wondered 1
what 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
best 1
to 1
do 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
friend 1
once 1
called 1
Maudsley 1
who 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
bad 1
and 1
has 1
just 1
been 1
serving 1
his 1
time 1
in 1
Pentonville 1
One 1
day 1
he 1
had 1
met 1
me 1
and 1
fell 1
into 1
talk 1
about 1
the 1
ways 1
of 1
thieves 1
and 1
how 1
they 1
could 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
what 1
they 1
stole 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
true 1
to 1
me 1
for 1
I 1
knew 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
things 1
about 1
him 1
so 1
I 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
to 1
go 1
right 1
on 1
to 1
Kilburn 1
where 1
he 1
lived 1
and 1
take 1
him 1
into 1
my 1
confidence 1
He 1
would 1
show 1
me 1
how 1
to 1
turn 1
the 1
stone 1
into 1
money 1
But 1
how 1
to 1
get 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
safety 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
agonies 1
I 1
had 1
gone 1
through 1
in 1
coming 1
from 1
the 1
hotel 1
I 1
might 1
at 1
any 1
moment 1
be 1
seized 1
and 1
searched 1
and 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
stone 1
in 1
my 1
waistcoat 1
pocket 1
I 1
was 1
leaning 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
geese 1
which 1
were 1
waddling 1
about 1
round 1
my 1
feet 1
and 1
suddenly 1
an 1
idea 1
came 1
into 1
my 1
head 1
which 1
showed 1
me 1
how 1
I 1
could 1
beat 1
the 1
best 1
detective 1
that 1
ever 1
lived 1
My 1
sister 1
had 1
told 1
me 1
some 1
weeks 1
before 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
have 1
the 1
pick 1
of 1
her 1
geese 1
for 1
a 1
Christmas 1
present 1
and 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
always 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
her 1
word 1
I 1
would 1
take 1
my 1
goose 1
now 1
and 1
in 1
it 1
I 1
would 1
carry 1
my 1
stone 1
to 1
Kilburn 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
shed 1
in 1
the 1
yard 1
and 1
behind 1
this 1
I 1
drove 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
birds 1
a 1
fine 1
big 1
one 1
white 1
with 1
a 1
barred 1
tail 1
I 1
caught 1
it 1
and 1
prying 1
its 1
bill 1
open 1
I 1
thrust 1
the 1
stone 1
down 1
its 1
throat 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
my 1
finger 1
could 1
reach 1
The 1
bird 1
gave 1
a 1
gulp 1
and 1
I 1
felt 1
the 1
stone 1
pass 1
along 1
its 1
gullet 1
and 1
down 1
into 1
its 1
crop 1
But 1
the 1
creature 1
flapped 1
and 1
struggled 1
and 1
out 1
came 1
my 1
sister 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
matter 1
As 1
I 1
turned 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
her 1
the 1
brute 1
broke 1
loose 1
and 1
fluttered 1
off 1
among 1
the 1
others 1
Whatever 1
were 1
you 1
doing 1
with 1
that 1
bird 1
Jem 1
says 1
she 1
Well 1
said 1
I 1
you 1
said 1
you 1
d 1
give 1
me 1
one 1
for 1
Christmas 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
feeling 1
which 1
was 1
the 1
fattest 1
Oh 1
says 1
she 1
we 1
ve 1
set 1
yours 1
aside 1
for 1
you 1
Jem 1
s 1
bird 1
we 1
call 1
it 1
It 1
s 1
the 1
big 1
white 1
one 1
over 1
yonder 1
There 1
s 1
twenty 1
six 1
of 1
them 1
which 1
makes 1
one 1
for 1
you 1
and 1
one 1
for 1
us 1
and 1
two 1
dozen 1
for 1
the 1
market 1
Thank 1
you 1
Maggie 1
says 1
I 1
but 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
the 1
same 1
to 1
you 1
I 1
d 1
rather 1
have 1
that 1
one 1
I 1
was 1
handling 1
just 1
now 1
The 1
other 1
is 1
a 1
good 1
three 1
pound 1
heavier 1
said 1
she 1
and 1
we 1
fattened 1
it 1
expressly 1
for 1
you 1
Never 1
mind 1
I 1
ll 1
have 1
the 1
other 1
and 1
I 1
ll 1
take 1
it 1
now 1
said 1
I 1
Oh 1
just 1
as 1
you 1
like 1
said 1
she 1
a 1
little 1
huffed 1
Which 1
is 1
it 1
you 1
want 1
then 1
That 1
white 1
one 1
with 1
the 1
barred 1
tail 1
right 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
flock 1
Oh 1
very 1
well 1
Kill 1
it 1
and 1
take 1
it 1
with 1
you 1
Well 1
I 1
did 1
what 1
she 1
said 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
and 1
I 1
carried 1
the 1
bird 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
Kilburn 1
I 1
told 1
my 1
pal 1
what 1
I 1
had 1
done 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
man 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
easy 1
to 1
tell 1
a 1
thing 1
like 1
that 1
to 1
He 1
laughed 1
until 1
he 1
choked 1
and 1
we 1
got 1
a 1
knife 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
goose 1
My 1
heart 1
turned 1
to 1
water 1
for 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
the 1
stone 1
and 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
some 1
terrible 1
mistake 1
had 1
occurred 1
I 1
left 1
the 1
bird 1
rushed 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
sister 1
s 1
and 1
hurried 1
into 1
the 1
back 1
yard 1
There 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
bird 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
there 1
Where 1
are 1
they 1
all 1
Maggie 1
I 1
cried 1
Gone 1
to 1
the 1
dealer 1
s 1
Jem 1
Which 1
dealer 1
s 1
Breckinridge 1
of 1
Covent 1
Garden 1
But 1
was 1
there 1
another 1
with 1
a 1
barred 1
tail 1
I 1
asked 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
the 1
one 1
I 1
chose 1
Yes 1
Jem 1
there 1
were 1
two 1
barred 1
tailed 1
ones 1
and 1
I 1
could 1
never 1
tell 1
them 1
apart 1
Well 1
then 1
of 1
course 1
I 1
saw 1
it 1
all 1
and 1
I 1
ran 1
off 1
as 1
hard 1
as 1
my 1
feet 1
would 1
carry 1
me 1
to 1
this 1
man 1
Breckinridge 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
sold 1
the 1
lot 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
not 1
one 1
word 1
would 1
he 1
tell 1
me 1
as 1
to 1
where 1
they 1
had 1
gone 1
You 1
heard 1
him 1
yourselves 1
to 1
night 1
Well 1
he 1
has 1
always 1
answered 1
me 1
like 1
that 1
My 1
sister 1
thinks 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
mad 1
Sometimes 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
myself 1
And 1
now 1
and 1
now 1
I 1
am 1
myself 1
a 1
branded 1
thief 1
without 1
ever 1
having 1
touched 1
the 1
wealth 1
for 1
which 1
I 1
sold 1
my 1
character 1
God 1
help 1
me 1
God 1
help 1
me 1
He 1
burst 1
into 1
convulsive 1
sobbing 1
with 1
his 1
face 1
buried 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
silence 1
broken 1
only 1
by 1
his 1
heavy 1
breathing 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
measured 1
tapping 1
of 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
finger 1
tips 1
upon 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
table 1
Then 1
my 1
friend 1
rose 1
and 1
threw 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
Get 1
out 1
said 1
he 1
What 1
sir 1
Oh 1
Heaven 1
bless 1
you 1
No 1
more 1
words 1
Get 1
out 1
And 1
no 1
more 1
words 1
were 1
needed 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
rush 1
a 1
clatter 1
upon 1
the 1
stairs 1
the 1
bang 1
of 1
a 1
door 1
and 1
the 1
crisp 1
rattle 1
of 1
running 1
footfalls 1
from 1
the 1
street 1
After 1
all 1
Watson 1
said 1
Holmes 1
reaching 1
up 1
his 1
hand 1
for 1
his 1
clay 1
pipe 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
retained 1
by 1
the 1
police 1
to 1
supply 1
their 1
deficiencies 1
If 1
Horner 1
were 1
in 1
danger 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
another 1
thing 1
but 1
this 1
fellow 1
will 1
not 1
appear 1
against 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
case 1
must 1
collapse 1
I 1
suppose 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
commuting 1
a 1
felony 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
just 1
possible 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
saving 1
a 1
soul 1
This 1
fellow 1
will 1
not 1
go 1
wrong 1
again 1
he 1
is 1
too 1
terribly 1
frightened 1
Send 1
him 1
to 1
gaol 1
now 1
and 1
you 1
make 1
him 1
a 1
gaol 1
bird 1
for 1
life 1
Besides 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
season 1
of 1
forgiveness 1
Chance 1
has 1
put 1
in 1
our 1
way 1
a 1
most 1
singular 1
and 1
whimsical 1
problem 1
and 1
its 1
solution 1
is 1
its 1
own 1
reward 1
If 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
the 1
goodness 1
to 1
touch 1
the 1
bell 1
Doctor 1
we 1
will 1
begin 1
another 1
investigation 1
in 1
which 1
also 1
a 1
bird 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
chief 1
feature 1
VIII 1
THE 1
ADVENTURE 1
OF 1
THE 1
SPECKLED 1
BAND 1
On 1
glancing 1
over 1
my 1
notes 1
of 1
the 1
seventy 1
odd 1
cases 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
during 1
the 1
last 1
eight 1
years 1
studied 1
the 1
methods 1
of 1
my 1
friend 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
I 1
find 1
many 1
tragic 1
some 1
comic 1
a 1
large 1
number 1
merely 1
strange 1
but 1
none 1
commonplace 1
for 1
working 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
rather 1
for 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
his 1
art 1
than 1
for 1
the 1
acquirement 1
of 1
wealth 1
he 1
refused 1
to 1
associate 1
himself 1
with 1
any 1
investigation 1
which 1
did 1
not 1
tend 1
towards 1
the 1
unusual 1
and 1
even 1
the 1
fantastic 1
Of 1
all 1
these 1
varied 1
cases 1
however 1
I 1
cannot 1
recall 1
any 1
which 1
presented 1
more 1
singular 1
features 1
than 1
that 1
which 1
was 1
associated 1
with 1
the 1
well 1
known 1
Surrey 1
family 1
of 1
the 1
Roylotts 1
of 1
Stoke 1
Moran 1
The 1
events 1
in 1
question 1
occurred 1
in 1
the 1
early 1
days 1
of 1
my 1
association 1
with 1
Holmes 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
sharing 1
rooms 1
as 1
bachelors 1
in 1
Baker 1
Street 1
It 1
is 1
possible 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
have 1
placed 1
them 1
upon 1
record 1
before 1
but 1
a 1
promise 1
of 1
secrecy 1
was 1
made 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
from 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
only 1
been 1
freed 1
during 1
the 1
last 1
month 1
by 1
the 1
untimely 1
death 1
of 1
the 1
lady 1
to 1
whom 1
the 1
pledge 1
was 1
given 1
It 1
is 1
perhaps 1
as 1
well 1
that 1
the 1
facts 1
should 1
now 1
come 1
to 1
light 1
for 1
I 1
have 1
reasons 1
to 1
know 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
widespread 1
rumours 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
Dr 1
Grimesby 1
Roylott 1
which 1
tend 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
matter 1
even 1
more 1
terrible 1
than 1
the 1
truth 1
It 1
was 1
early 1
in 1
April 1
in 1
the 1
year 1
that 1
I 1
woke 1
one 1
morning 1
to 1
find 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
standing 1
fully 1
dressed 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
my 1
bed 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
late 1
riser 1
as 1
a 1
rule 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
clock 1
on 1
the 1
mantelpiece 1
showed 1
me 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
quarter 1
past 1
seven 1
I 1
blinked 1
up 1
at 1
him 1
in 1
some 1
surprise 1
and 1
perhaps 1
just 1
a 1
little 1
resentment 1
for 1
I 1
was 1
myself 1
regular 1
in 1
my 1
habits 1
Very 1
sorry 1
to 1
knock 1
you 1
up 1
Watson 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
it 1
s 1
the 1
common 1
lot 1
this 1
morning 1
Mrs 1
Hudson 1
has 1
been 1
knocked 1
up 1
she 1
retorted 1
upon 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
on 1
you 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
then 1
a 1
fire 1
No 1
a 1
client 1
It 1
seems 1
that 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
has 1
arrived 1
in 1
a 1
considerable 1
state 1
of 1
excitement 1
who 1
insists 1
upon 1
seeing 1
me 1
She 1
is 1
waiting 1
now 1
in 1
the 1
sitting 1
room 1
Now 1
when 1
young 1
ladies 1
wander 1
about 1
the 1
metropolis 1
at 1
this 1
hour 1
of 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
knock 1
sleepy 1
people 1
up 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
beds 1
I 1
presume 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
something 1
very 1
pressing 1
which 1
they 1
have 1
to 1
communicate 1
Should 1
it 1
prove 1
to 1
be 1
an 1
interesting 1
case 1
you 1
would 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
wish 1
to 1
follow 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
outset 1
I 1
thought 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
call 1
you 1
and 1
give 1
you 1
the 1
chance 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
miss 1
it 1
for 1
anything 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
keener 1
pleasure 1
than 1
in 1
following 1
Holmes 1
in 1
his 1
professional 1
investigations 1
and 1
in 1
admiring 1
the 1
rapid 1
deductions 1
as 1
swift 1
as 1
intuitions 1
and 1
yet 1
always 1
founded 1
on 1
a 1
logical 1
basis 1
with 1
which 1
he 1
unravelled 1
the 1
problems 1
which 1
were 1
submitted 1
to 1
him 1
I 1
rapidly 1
threw 1
on 1
my 1
clothes 1
and 1
was 1
ready 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
to 1
accompany 1
my 1
friend 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
sitting 1
room 1
A 1
lady 1
dressed 1
in 1
black 1
and 1
heavily 1
veiled 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
sitting 1
in 1
the 1
window 1
rose 1
as 1
we 1
entered 1
Good 1
morning 1
madam 1
said 1
Holmes 1
cheerily 1
My 1
name 1
is 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
This 1
is 1
my 1
intimate 1
friend 1
and 1
associate 1
Dr 1
Watson 1
before 1
whom 1
you 1
can 1
speak 1
as 1
freely 1
as 1
before 1
myself 1
Ha 1
I 1
am 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
Mrs 1
Hudson 1
has 1
had 1
the 1
good 1
sense 1
to 1
light 1
the 1
fire 1
Pray 1
draw 1
up 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
I 1
shall 1
order 1
you 1
a 1
cup 1
of 1
hot 1
coffee 1
for 1
I 1
observe 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
shivering 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
cold 1
which 1
makes 1
me 1
shiver 1
said 1
the 1
woman 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
voice 1
changing 1
her 1
seat 1
as 1
requested 1
What 1
then 1
It 1
is 1
fear 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
It 1
is 1
terror 1
She 1
raised 1
her 1
veil 1
as 1
she 1
spoke 1
and 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
indeed 1
in 1
a 1
pitiable 1
state 1
of 1
agitation 1
her 1
face 1
all 1
drawn 1
and 1
grey 1
with 1
restless 1
frightened 1
eyes 1
like 1
those 1
of 1
some 1
hunted 1
animal 1
Her 1
features 1
and 1
figure 1
were 1
those 1
of 1
a 1
woman 1
of 1
thirty 1
but 1
her 1
hair 1
was 1
shot 1
with 1
premature 1
grey 1
and 1
her 1
expression 1
was 1
weary 1
and 1
haggard 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
ran 1
her 1
over 1
with 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
quick 1
all 1
comprehensive 1
glances 1
You 1
must 1
not 1
fear 1
said 1
he 1
soothingly 1
bending 1
forward 1
and 1
patting 1
her 1
forearm 1
We 1
shall 1
soon 1
set 1
matters 1
right 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
You 1
have 1
come 1
in 1
by 1
train 1
this 1
morning 1
I 1
see 1
You 1
know 1
me 1
then 1
No 1
but 1
I 1
observe 1
the 1
second 1
half 1
of 1
a 1
return 1
ticket 1
in 1
the 1
palm 1
of 1
your 1
left 1
glove 1
You 1
must 1
have 1
started 1
early 1
and 1
yet 1
you 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
drive 1
in 1
a 1
dog 1
cart 1
along 1
heavy 1
roads 1
before 1
you 1
reached 1
the 1
station 1
The 1
lady 1
gave 1
a 1
violent 1
start 1
and 1
stared 1
in 1
bewilderment 1
at 1
my 1
companion 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
mystery 1
my 1
dear 1
madam 1
said 1
he 1
smiling 1
The 1
left 1
arm 1
of 1
your 1
jacket 1
is 1
spattered 1
with 1
mud 1
in 1
no 1
less 1
than 1
seven 1
places 1
The 1
marks 1
are 1
perfectly 1
fresh 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
vehicle 1
save 1
a 1
dog 1
cart 1
which 1
throws 1
up 1
mud 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
and 1
then 1
only 1
when 1
you 1
sit 1
on 1
the 1
left 1
hand 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
driver 1
Whatever 1
your 1
reasons 1
may 1
be 1
you 1
are 1
perfectly 1
correct 1
said 1
she 1
I 1
started 1
from 1
home 1
before 1
six 1
reached 1
Leatherhead 1
at 1
twenty 1
past 1
and 1
came 1
in 1
by 1
the 1
first 1
train 1
to 1
Waterloo 1
Sir 1
I 1
can 1
stand 1
this 1
strain 1
no 1
longer 1
I 1
shall 1
go 1
mad 1
if 1
it 1
continues 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
one 1
to 1
turn 1
to 1
none 1
save 1
only 1
one 1
who 1
cares 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
he 1
poor 1
fellow 1
can 1
be 1
of 1
little 1
aid 1
I 1
have 1
heard 1
of 1
you 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
I 1
have 1
heard 1
of 1
you 1
from 1
Mrs 1
Farintosh 1
whom 1
you 1
helped 1
in 1
the 1
hour 1
of 1
her 1
sore 1
need 1
It 1
was 1
from 1
her 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
your 1
address 1
Oh 1
sir 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
help 1
me 1
too 1
and 1
at 1
least 1
throw 1
a 1
little 1
light 1
through 1
the 1
dense 1
darkness 1
which 1
surrounds 1
me 1
At 1
present 1
it 1
is 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
power 1
to 1
reward 1
you 1
for 1
your 1
services 1
but 1
in 1
a 1
month 1
or 1
six 1
weeks 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
married 1
with 1
the 1
control 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
income 1
and 1
then 1
at 1
least 1
you 1
shall 1
not 1
find 1
me 1
ungrateful 1
Holmes 1
turned 1
to 1
his 1
desk 1
and 1
unlocking 1
it 1
drew 1
out 1
a 1
small 1
case 1
book 1
which 1
he 1
consulted 1
Farintosh 1
said 1
he 1
Ah 1
yes 1
I 1
recall 1
the 1
case 1
it 1
was 1
concerned 1
with 1
an 1
opal 1
tiara 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
was 1
before 1
your 1
time 1
Watson 1
I 1
can 1
only 1
say 1
madam 1
that 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
happy 1
to 1
devote 1
the 1
same 1
care 1
to 1
your 1
case 1
as 1
I 1
did 1
to 1
that 1
of 1
your 1
friend 1
As 1
to 1
reward 1
my 1
profession 1
is 1
its 1
own 1
reward 1
but 1
you 1
are 1
at 1
liberty 1
to 1
defray 1
whatever 1
expenses 1
I 1
may 1
be 1
put 1
to 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
which 1
suits 1
you 1
best 1
And 1
now 1
I 1
beg 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
lay 1
before 1
us 1
everything 1
that 1
may 1
help 1
us 1
in 1
forming 1
an 1
opinion 1
upon 1
the 1
matter 1
Alas 1
replied 1
our 1
visitor 1
the 1
very 1
horror 1
of 1
my 1
situation 1
lies 1
in 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
my 1
fears 1
are 1
so 1
vague 1
and 1
my 1
suspicions 1
depend 1
so 1
entirely 1
upon 1
small 1
points 1
which 1
might 1
seem 1
trivial 1
to 1
another 1
that 1
even 1
he 1
to 1
whom 1
of 1
all 1
others 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
look 1
for 1
help 1
and 1
advice 1
looks 1
upon 1
all 1
that 1
I 1
tell 1
him 1
about 1
it 1
as 1
the 1
fancies 1
of 1
a 1
nervous 1
woman 1
He 1
does 1
not 1
say 1
so 1
but 1
I 1
can 1
read 1
it 1
from 1
his 1
soothing 1
answers 1
and 1
averted 1
eyes 1
But 1
I 1
have 1
heard 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
that 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
deeply 1
into 1
the 1
manifold 1
wickedness 1
of 1
the 1
human 1
heart 1
You 1
may 1
advise 1
me 1
how 1
to 1
walk 1
amid 1
the 1
dangers 1
which 1
encompass 1
me 1
I 1
am 1
all 1
attention 1
madam 1
My 1
name 1
is 1
Helen 1
Stoner 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
living 1
with 1
my 1
stepfather 1
who 1
is 1
the 1
last 1
survivor 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
oldest 1
Saxon 1
families 1
in 1
England 1
the 1
Roylotts 1
of 1
Stoke 1
Moran 1
on 1
the 1
western 1
border 1
of 1
Surrey 1
Holmes 1
nodded 1
his 1
head 1
The 1
name 1
is 1
familiar 1
to 1
me 1
said 1
he 1
The 1
family 1
was 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
among 1
the 1
richest 1
in 1
England 1
and 1
the 1
estates 1
extended 1
over 1
the 1
borders 1
into 1
Berkshire 1
in 1
the 1
north 1
and 1
Hampshire 1
in 1
the 1
west 1
In 1
the 1
last 1
century 1
however 1
four 1
successive 1
heirs 1
were 1
of 1
a 1
dissolute 1
and 1
wasteful 1
disposition 1
and 1
the 1
family 1
ruin 1
was 1
eventually 1
completed 1
by 1
a 1
gambler 1
in 1
the 1
days 1
of 1
the 1
Regency 1
Nothing 1
was 1
left 1
save 1
a 1
few 1
acres 1
of 1
ground 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
hundred 1
year 1
old 1
house 1
which 1
is 1
itself 1
crushed 1
under 1
a 1
heavy 1
mortgage 1
The 1
last 1
squire 1
dragged 1
out 1
his 1
existence 1
there 1
living 1
the 1
horrible 1
life 1
of 1
an 1
aristocratic 1
pauper 1
but 1
his 1
only 1
son 1
my 1
stepfather 1
seeing 1
that 1
he 1
must 1
adapt 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
new 1
conditions 1
obtained 1
an 1
advance 1
from 1
a 1
relative 1
which 1
enabled 1
him 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
medical 1
degree 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
to 1
Calcutta 1
where 1
by 1
his 1
professional 1
skill 1
and 1
his 1
force 1
of 1
character 1
he 1
established 1
a 1
large 1
practice 1
In 1
a 1
fit 1
of 1
anger 1
however 1
caused 1
by 1
some 1
robberies 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
perpetrated 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
he 1
beat 1
his 1
native 1
butler 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
narrowly 1
escaped 1
a 1
capital 1
sentence 1
As 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
suffered 1
a 1
long 1
term 1
of 1
imprisonment 1
and 1
afterwards 1
returned 1
to 1
England 1
a 1
morose 1
and 1
disappointed 1
man 1
When 1
Dr 1
Roylott 1
was 1
in 1
India 1
he 1
married 1
my 1
mother 1
Mrs 1
Stoner 1
the 1
young 1
widow 1
of 1
Major 1
General 1
Stoner 1
of 1
the 1
Bengal 1
Artillery 1
My 1
sister 1
Julia 1
and 1
I 1
were 1
twins 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
only 1
two 1
years 1
old 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
my 1
mother 1
s 1
re 1
marriage 1
She 1
had 1
a 1
considerable 1
sum 1
of 1
money 1
not 1
less 1
than 1
pounds 1
a 1
year 1
and 1
this 1
she 1
bequeathed 1
to 1
Dr 1
Roylott 1
entirely 1
while 1
we 1
resided 1
with 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
provision 1
that 1
a 1
certain 1
annual 1
sum 1
should 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
each 1
of 1
us 1
in 1
the 1
event 1
of 1
our 1
marriage 1
Shortly 1
after 1
our 1
return 1
to 1
England 1
my 1
mother 1
died 1
she 1
was 1
killed 1
eight 1
years 1
ago 1
in 1
a 1
railway 1
accident 1
near 1
Crewe 1
Dr 1
Roylott 1
then 1
abandoned 1
his 1
attempts 1
to 1
establish 1
himself 1
in 1
practice 1
in 1
London 1
and 1
took 1
us 1
to 1
live 1
with 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
ancestral 1
house 1
at 1
Stoke 1
Moran 1
The 1
money 1
which 1
my 1
mother 1
had 1
left 1
was 1
enough 1
for 1
all 1
our 1
wants 1
and 1
there 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
no 1
obstacle 1
to 1
our 1
happiness 1
But 1
a 1
terrible 1
change 1
came 1
over 1
our 1
stepfather 1
about 1
this 1
time 1
Instead 1
of 1
making 1
friends 1
and 1
exchanging 1
visits 1
with 1
our 1
neighbours 1
who 1
had 1
at 1
first 1
been 1
overjoyed 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
Roylott 1
of 1
Stoke 1
Moran 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
family 1
seat 1
he 1
shut 1
himself 1
up 1
in 1
his 1
house 1
and 1
seldom 1
came 1
out 1
save 1
to 1
indulge 1
in 1
ferocious 1
quarrels 1
with 1
whoever 1
might 1
cross 1
his 1
path 1
Violence 1
of 1
temper 1
approaching 1
to 1
mania 1
has 1
been 1
hereditary 1
in 1
the 1
men 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
and 1
in 1
my 1
stepfather 1
s 1
case 1
it 1
had 1
I 1
believe 1
been 1
intensified 1
by 1
his 1
long 1
residence 1
in 1
the 1
tropics 1
A 1
series 1
of 1
disgraceful 1
brawls 1
took 1
place 1
two 1
of 1
which 1
ended 1
in 1
the 1
police 1
court 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
became 1
the 1
terror 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
the 1
folks 1
would 1
fly 1
at 1
his 1
approach 1
for 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
immense 1
strength 1
and 1
absolutely 1
uncontrollable 1
in 1
his 1
anger 1
Last 1
week 1
he 1
hurled 1
the 1
local 1
blacksmith 1
over 1
a 1
parapet 1
into 1
a 1
stream 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
by 1
paying 1
over 1
all 1
the 1
money 1
which 1
I 1
could 1
gather 1
together 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
avert 1
another 1
public 1
exposure 1
He 1
had 1
no 1
friends 1
at 1
all 1
save 1
the 1
wandering 1
gipsies 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
give 1
these 1
vagabonds 1
leave 1
to 1
encamp 1
upon 1
the 1
few 1
acres 1
of 1
bramble 1
covered 1
land 1
which 1
represent 1
the 1
family 1
estate 1
and 1
would 1
accept 1
in 1
return 1
the 1
hospitality 1
of 1
their 1
tents 1
wandering 1
away 1
with 1
them 1
sometimes 1
for 1
weeks 1
on 1
end 1
He 1
has 1
a 1
passion 1
also 1
for 1
Indian 1
animals 1
which 1
are 1
sent 1
over 1
to 1
him 1
by 1
a 1
correspondent 1
and 1
he 1
has 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
a 1
cheetah 1
and 1
a 1
baboon 1
which 1
wander 1
freely 1
over 1
his 1
grounds 1
and 1
are 1
feared 1
by 1
the 1
villagers 1
almost 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
their 1
master 1
You 1
can 1
imagine 1
from 1
what 1
I 1
say 1
that 1
my 1
poor 1
sister 1
Julia 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
great 1
pleasure 1
in 1
our 1
lives 1
No 1
servant 1
would 1
stay 1
with 1
us 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
we 1
did 1
all 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
She 1
was 1
but 1
thirty 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
her 1
death 1
and 1
yet 1
her 1
hair 1
had 1
already 1
begun 1
to 1
whiten 1
even 1
as 1
mine 1
has 1
Your 1
sister 1
is 1
dead 1
then 1
She 1
died 1
just 1
two 1
years 1
ago 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
of 1
her 1
death 1
that 1
I 1
wish 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
you 1
You 1
can 1
understand 1
that 1
living 1
the 1
life 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
described 1
we 1
were 1
little 1
likely 1
to 1
see 1
anyone 1
of 1
our 1
own 1
age 1
and 1
position 1
We 1
had 1
however 1
an 1
aunt 1
my 1
mother 1
s 1
maiden 1
sister 1
Miss 1
Honoria 1
Westphail 1
who 1
lives 1
near 1
Harrow 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
occasionally 1
allowed 1
to 1
pay 1
short 1
visits 1
at 1
this 1
lady 1
s 1
house 1
Julia 1
went 1
there 1
at 1
Christmas 1
two 1
years 1
ago 1
and 1
met 1
there 1
a 1
half 1
pay 1
major 1
of 1
marines 1
to 1
whom 1
she 1
became 1
engaged 1
My 1
stepfather 1
learned 1
of 1
the 1
engagement 1
when 1
my 1
sister 1
returned 1
and 1
offered 1
no 1
objection 1
to 1
the 1
marriage 1
but 1
within 1
a 1
fortnight 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
fixed 1
for 1
the 1
wedding 1
the 1
terrible 1
event 1
occurred 1
which 1
has 1
deprived 1
me 1
of 1
my 1
only 1
companion 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
had 1
been 1
leaning 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
with 1
his 1
eyes 1
closed 1
and 1
his 1
head 1
sunk 1
in 1
a 1
cushion 1
but 1
he 1
half 1
opened 1
his 1
lids 1
now 1
and 1
glanced 1
across 1
at 1
his 1
visitor 1
Pray 1
be 1
precise 1
as 1
to 1
details 1
said 1
he 1
It 1
is 1
easy 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
for 1
every 1
event 1
of 1
that 1
dreadful 1
time 1
is 1
seared 1
into 1
my 1
memory 1
The 1
manor 1
house 1
is 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
already 1
said 1
very 1
old 1
and 1
only 1
one 1
wing 1
is 1
now 1
inhabited 1
The 1
bedrooms 1
in 1
this 1
wing 1
are 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
floor 1
the 1
sitting 1
rooms 1
being 1
in 1
the 1
central 1
block 1
of 1
the 1
buildings 1
Of 1
these 1
bedrooms 1
the 1
first 1
is 1
Dr 1
Roylott 1
s 1
the 1
second 1
my 1
sister 1
s 1
and 1
the 1
third 1
my 1
own 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
communication 1
between 1
them 1
but 1
they 1
all 1
open 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
same 1
corridor 1
Do 1
I 1
make 1
myself 1
plain 1
Perfectly 1
so 1
The 1
windows 1
of 1
the 1
three 1
rooms 1
open 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
lawn 1
That 1
fatal 1
night 1
Dr 1
Roylott 1
had 1
gone 1
to 1
his 1
room 1
early 1
though 1
we 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
retired 1
to 1
rest 1
for 1
my 1
sister 1
was 1
troubled 1
by 1
the 1
smell 1
of 1
the 1
strong 1
Indian 1
cigars 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
custom 1
to 1
smoke 1
She 1
left 1
her 1
room 1
therefore 1
and 1
came 1
into 1
mine 1
where 1
she 1
sat 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
chatting 1
about 1
her 1
approaching 1
wedding 1
At 1
eleven 1
o 1
clock 1
she 1
rose 1
to 1
leave 1
me 1
but 1
she 1
paused 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
looked 1
back 1
Tell 1
me 1
Helen 1
said 1
she 1
have 1
you 1
ever 1
heard 1
anyone 1
whistle 1
in 1
the 1
dead 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
Never 1
said 1
I 2
suppose 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
not 1
possibly 1
whistle 1
yourself 1
in 1
your 1
sleep 1
Certainly 1
not 1
But 1
why 1
Because 1
during 1
the 1
last 1
few 1
nights 1
I 1
have 1
always 1
about 1
three 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
heard 1
a 1
low 1
clear 1
whistle 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
light 1
sleeper 1
and 1
it 1
has 1
awakened 1
me 1
I 1
cannot 1
tell 1
where 1
it 1
came 1
from 1
perhaps 1
from 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
perhaps 1
from 1
the 1
lawn 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
I 1
would 1
just 1
ask 1
you 1
whether 1
you 1
had 1
heard 1
it 1
No 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
It 1
must 1
be 1
those 1
wretched 1
gipsies 1
in 1
the 1
plantation 1
Very 1
likely 1
And 1
yet 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
on 1
the 1
lawn 1
I 1
wonder 1
that 1
you 1
did 1
not 1
hear 1
it 1
also 1
Ah 1
but 1
I 1
sleep 1
more 1
heavily 1
than 1
you 1
Well 1
it 1
is 1
of 1
no 1
great 1
consequence 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
She 1
smiled 1
back 1
at 1
me 1
closed 1
my 1
door 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
later 1
I 1
heard 1
her 1
key 1
turn 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
Indeed 1
said 1
Holmes 1
Was 1
it 1
your 1
custom 1
always 1
to 1
lock 1
yourselves 1
in 1
at 1
night 1
Always 1
And 1
why 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
mentioned 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
the 1
doctor 1
kept 1
a 1
cheetah 1
and 1
a 1
baboon 1
We 1
had 1
no 1
feeling 1
of 1
security 1
unless 1
our 1
doors 1
were 1
locked 1
Quite 1
so 1
Pray 1
proceed 1
with 1
your 1
statement 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
sleep 1
that 1
night 1
A 1
vague 1
feeling 1
of 1
impending 1
misfortune 1
impressed 1
me 1
My 1
sister 1
and 1
I 1
you 1
will 1
recollect 1
were 1
twins 1
and 1
you 1
know 1
how 1
subtle 1
are 1
the 1
links 1
which 1
bind 1
two 1
souls 1
which 1
are 1
so 1
closely 1
allied 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
wild 1
night 1
The 1
wind 1
was 1
howling 1
outside 1
and 1
the 1
rain 1
was 1
beating 1
and 1
splashing 1
against 1
the 1
windows 1
Suddenly 1
amid 1
all 1
the 1
hubbub 1
of 1
the 1
gale 1
there 1
burst 1
forth 1
the 1
wild 1
scream 1
of 1
a 1
terrified 1
woman 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
my 1
sister 1
s 1
voice 1
I 1
sprang 1
from 1
my 1
bed 1
wrapped 1
a 1
shawl 1
round 1
me 1
and 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
corridor 1
As 1
I 1
opened 1
my 1
door 1
I 1
seemed 1
to 1
hear 1
a 1
low 1
whistle 1
such 1
as 1
my 1
sister 1
described 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
later 1
a 1
clanging 1
sound 1
as 1
if 1
a 1
mass 1
of 1
metal 1
had 1
fallen 1
As 1
I 1
ran 1
down 1
the 1
passage 1
my 1
sister 1
s 1
door 1
was 1
unlocked 1
and 1
revolved 1
slowly 1
upon 1
its 1
hinges 1
I 1
stared 1
at 1
it 1
horror 1
stricken 1
not 1
knowing 1
what 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
issue 1
from 1
it 1
By 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
corridor 1
lamp 1
I 1
saw 1
my 1
sister 1
appear 1
at 1
the 1
opening 1
her 1
face 1
blanched 1
with 1
terror 1
her 1
hands 1
groping 1
for 1
help 1
her 1
whole 1
figure 1
swaying 1
to 1
and 1
fro 1
like 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
drunkard 1
I 1
ran 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
threw 1
my 1
arms 1
round 1
her 1
but 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
her 1
knees 1
seemed 1
to 1
give 1
way 1
and 1
she 1
fell 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
She 1
writhed 1
as 1
one 1
who 1
is 1
in 1
terrible 1
pain 1
and 1
her 1
limbs 1
were 1
dreadfully 1
convulsed 1
At 1
first 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
not 1
recognised 1
me 1
but 1
as 1
I 1
bent 1
over 1
her 1
she 1
suddenly 1
shrieked 1
out 1
in 1
a 1
voice 1
which 1
I 1
shall 1
never 1
forget 1
Oh 1
my 1
God 1
Helen 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
band 1
The 1
speckled 1
band 1
There 1
was 1
something 1
else 1
which 1
she 1
would 1
fain 1
have 1
said 1
and 1
she 1
stabbed 1
with 1
her 1
finger 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
doctor 1
s 1
room 1
but 1
a 1
fresh 1
convulsion 1
seized 1
her 1
and 1
choked 1
her 1
words 1
I 1
rushed 1
out 1
calling 1
loudly 1
for 1
my 1
stepfather 1
and 1
I 1
met 1
him 1
hastening 1
from 1
his 1
room 1
in 1
his 1
dressing 1
gown 1
When 1
he 1
reached 1
my 1
sister 1
s 1
side 1
she 1
was 1
unconscious 1
and 1
though 1
he 1
poured 1
brandy 1
down 1
her 1
throat 1
and 1
sent 1
for 1
medical 1
aid 1
from 1
the 1
village 1
all 1
efforts 1
were 1
in 1
vain 1
for 1
she 1
slowly 1
sank 1
and 1
died 1
without 1
having 1
recovered 1
her 1
consciousness 1
Such 1
was 1
the 1
dreadful 1
end 1
of 1
my 1
beloved 1
sister 1
One 1
moment 1
said 1
Holmes 1
are 1
you 1
sure 1
about 1
this 1
whistle 1
and 1
metallic 1
sound 1
Could 1
you 1
swear 1
to 1
it 1
That 1
was 1
what 1
the 1
county 1
coroner 1
asked 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
inquiry 1
It 1
is 1
my 1
strong 1
impression 1
that 1
I 1
heard 1
it 1
and 1
yet 1
among 1
the 1
crash 1
of 1
the 1
gale 1
and 1
the 1
creaking 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
house 1
I 1
may 1
possibly 1
have 1
been 1
deceived 1
Was 1
your 1
sister 1
dressed 1
No 1
she 1
was 1
in 1
her 1
night 1
dress 1
In 1
her 1
right 1
hand 1
was 1
found 1
the 1
charred 1
stump 1
of 1
a 1
match 1
and 1
in 1
her 1
left 1
a 1
match 1
box 1
Showing 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
struck 1
a 1
light 1
and 1
looked 1
about 1
her 1
when 1
the 1
alarm 1
took 1
place 1
That 1
is 1
important 1
And 1
what 1
conclusions 1
did 1
the 1
coroner 1
come 1
to 1
He 1
investigated 1
the 1
case 1
with 1
great 1
care 1
for 1
Dr 1
Roylott 1
s 1
conduct 1
had 1
long 1
been 1
notorious 1
in 1
the 1
county 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
find 1
any 1
satisfactory 1
cause 1
of 1
death 1
My 1
evidence 1
showed 1
that 1
the 1
door 1
had 1
been 1
fastened 1
upon 1
the 1
inner 1
side 1
and 1
the 1
windows 1
were 1
blocked 1
by 1
old 1
fashioned 1
shutters 1
with 1
broad 1
iron 1
bars 1
which 1
were 1
secured 1
every 1
night 1
The 1
walls 1
were 1
carefully 1
sounded 1
and 1
were 1
shown 1
to 1
be 1
quite 1
solid 1
all 1
round 1
and 1
the 1
flooring 1
was 1
also 1
thoroughly 1
examined 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
result 1
The 1
chimney 1
is 1
wide 1
but 1
is 1
barred 1
up 1
by 1
four 1
large 1
staples 1
It 1
is 1
certain 1
therefore 1
that 1
my 1
sister 1
was 1
quite 1
alone 1
when 1
she 1
met 1
her 1
end 1
Besides 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
marks 1
of 1
any 1
violence 1
upon 1
her 1
How 1
about 1
poison 1
The 1
doctors 1
examined 1
her 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
without 1
success 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
this 1
unfortunate 1
lady 1
died 1
of 1
then 1
It 1
is 1
my 1
belief 1
that 1
she 1
died 1
of 1
pure 1
fear 1
and 1
nervous 1
shock 1
though 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
frightened 1
her 1
I 1
cannot 1
imagine 1
Were 1
there 1
gipsies 1
in 1
the 1
plantation 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
Yes 1
there 1
are 1
nearly 1
always 1
some 1
there 1
Ah 1
and 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
gather 1
from 1
this 1
allusion 1
to 1
a 1
band 1
a 1
speckled 1
band 1
Sometimes 1
I 1
have 1
thought 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
merely 1
the 1
wild 1
talk 1
of 1
delirium 1
sometimes 1
that 1
it 1
may 1
have 1
referred 1
to 1
some 1
band 1
of 1
people 1
perhaps 1
to 1
these 1
very 1
gipsies 1
in 1
the 1
plantation 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
whether 1
the 1
spotted 1
handkerchiefs 1
which 1
so 1
many 1
of 1
them 1
wear 1
over 1
their 1
heads 1
might 1
have 1
suggested 1
the 1
strange 1
adjective 1
which 1
she 1
used 1
Holmes 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
like 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
far 1
from 1
being 1
satisfied 1
These 1
are 1
very 1
deep 1
waters 1
said 1
he 1
pray 1
go 1
on 1
with 1
your 1
narrative 1
Two 1
years 1
have 1
passed 1
since 1
then 1
and 1
my 1
life 1
has 1
been 1
until 1
lately 1
lonelier 1
than 1
ever 1
A 1
month 1
ago 1
however 1
a 1
dear 1
friend 1
whom 1
I 1
have 1
known 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
has 1
done 1
me 1
the 1
honour 1
to 1
ask 1
my 1
hand 1
in 1
marriage 1
His 1
name 1
is 1
Armitage 1
Percy 1
Armitage 1
the 1
second 1
son 1
of 1
Mr 1
Armitage 1
of 1
Crane 1
Water 1
near 1
Reading 1
My 1
stepfather 1
has 1
offered 1
no 1
opposition 1
to 1
the 1
match 1
and 1
we 1
are 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
in 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
the 1
spring 1
Two 1
days 1
ago 1
some 1
repairs 1
were 1
started 1
in 1
the 1
west 1
wing 1
of 1
the 1
building 1
and 1
my 1
bedroom 1
wall 1
has 1
been 1
pierced 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
had 1
to 1
move 1
into 1
the 1
chamber 1
in 1
which 1
my 1
sister 1
died 1
and 1
to 1
sleep 1
in 1
the 1
very 1
bed 1
in 1
which 1
she 1
slept 1
Imagine 1
then 1
my 1
thrill 1
of 1
terror 1
when 1
last 1
night 1
as 1
I 1
lay 1
awake 1
thinking 1
over 1
her 1
terrible 1
fate 1
I 1
suddenly 1
heard 1
in 1
the 1
silence 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
the 1
low 1
whistle 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
herald 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
death 1
I 1
sprang 1
up 1
and 1
lit 1
the 1
lamp 1
but 1
nothing 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
I 1
was 1
too 1
shaken 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
bed 1
again 1
however 1
so 1
I 1
dressed 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
daylight 1
I 1
slipped 1
down 1
got 1
a 1
dog 1
cart 1
at 1
the 1
Crown 1
Inn 1
which 1
is 1
opposite 1
and 1
drove 1
to 1
Leatherhead 1
from 1
whence 1
I 1
have 1
come 1
on 1
this 1
morning 1
with 1
the 1
one 1
object 1
of 1
seeing 1
you 1
and 1
asking 1
your 1
advice 1
You 1
have 1
done 1
wisely 1
said 1
my 1
friend 1
But 1
have 1
you 1
told 1
me 1
all 1
Yes 1
all 1
Miss 1
Roylott 1
you 1
have 1
not 1
You 1
are 1
screening 1
your 1
stepfather 1
Why 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
For 1
answer 1
Holmes 1
pushed 1
back 1
the 1
frill 1
of 1
black 1
lace 1
which 1
fringed 1
the 1
hand 1
that 1
lay 1
upon 1
our 1
visitor 1
s 1
knee 1
Five 1
little 1
livid 1
spots 1
the 1
marks 1
of 1
four 1
fingers 1
and 1
a 1
thumb 1
were 1
printed 1
upon 1
the 1
white 1
wrist 1
You 1
have 1
been 1
cruelly 1
used 1
said 1
Holmes 1
The 1
lady 1
coloured 1
deeply 1
and 1
covered 1
over 1
her 1
injured 1
wrist 1
He 1
is 1
a 1
hard 1
man 1
she 1
said 1
and 1
perhaps 1
he 1
hardly 1
knows 1
his 1
own 1
strength 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
silence 1
during 1
which 1
Holmes 1
leaned 1
his 1
chin 1
upon 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
stared 1
into 1
the 1
crackling 1
fire 1
This 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
deep 1
business 1
he 1
said 1
at 1
last 1
There 1
are 1
a 1
thousand 1
details 1
which 1
I 1
should 1
desire 1
to 1
know 1
before 1
I 1
decide 1
upon 1
our 1
course 1
of 1
action 1
Yet 1
we 1
have 1
not 1
a 1
moment 1
to 1
lose 1
If 1
we 1
were 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
Stoke 1
Moran 1
to 1
day 1
would 1
it 1
be 1
possible 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
see 1
over 1
these 1
rooms 1
without 1
the 1
knowledge 1
of 1
your 1
stepfather 1
As 1
it 1
happens 1
he 1
spoke 1
of 1
coming 1
into 1
town 1
to 1
day 1
upon 1
some 1
most 1
important 1
business 1
It 1
is 1
probable 1
that 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
away 1
all 1
day 1
and 1
that 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
nothing 1
to 1
disturb 1
you 1
We 1
have 1
a 1
housekeeper 1
now 1
but 1
she 1
is 1
old 1
and 1
foolish 1
and 1
I 1
could 1
easily 1
get 1
her 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
Excellent 1
You 1
are 1
not 1
averse 1
to 1
this 1
trip 1
Watson 1
By 1
no 1
means 1
Then 1
we 1
shall 1
both 1
come 1
What 1
are 1
you 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
yourself 1
I 1
have 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
things 1
which 1
I 1
would 1
wish 1
to 1
do 1
now 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
in 1
town 1
But 1
I 1
shall 1
return 1
by 1
the 1
twelve 1
o 1
clock 1
train 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
be 1
there 1
in 1
time 1
for 1
your 1
coming 1
And 1
you 1
may 1
expect 1
us 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
I 1
have 1
myself 1
some 1
small 1
business 1
matters 1
to 1
attend 1
to 1
Will 1
you 1
not 1
wait 1
and 1
breakfast 1
No 1
I 1
must 1
go 1
My 1
heart 1
is 1
lightened 1
already 1
since 1
I 1
have 1
confided 1
my 1
trouble 1
to 1
you 1
I 1
shall 1
look 1
forward 1
to 1
seeing 1
you 1
again 1
this 1
afternoon 1
She 1
dropped 1
her 1
thick 1
black 1
veil 1
over 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
glided 1
from 1
the 1
room 1
And 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
all 1
Watson 1
asked 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
leaning 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
It 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
most 1
dark 1
and 1
sinister 1
business 1
Dark 1
enough 1
and 1
sinister 1
enough 1
Yet 1
if 1
the 1
lady 1
is 1
correct 1
in 1
saying 1
that 1
the 1
flooring 1
and 1
walls 1
are 1
sound 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
door 1
window 1
and 1
chimney 1
are 1
impassable 1
then 1
her 1
sister 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
undoubtedly 1
alone 1
when 1
she 1
met 1
her 1
mysterious 1
end 1
What 1
becomes 1
then 1
of 1
these 1
nocturnal 1
whistles 1
and 1
what 1
of 1
the 1
very 1
peculiar 1
words 1
of 1
the 1
dying 1
woman 1
I 1
cannot 1
think 1
When 1
you 1
combine 1
the 1
ideas 1
of 1
whistles 1
at 1
night 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
a 1
band 1
of 1
gipsies 1
who 1
are 1
on 1
intimate 1
terms 1
with 1
this 1
old 1
doctor 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
every 1
reason 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
the 1
doctor 1
has 1
an 1
interest 1
in 1
preventing 1
his 1
stepdaughter 1
s 1
marriage 1
the 1
dying 1
allusion 1
to 1
a 1
band 1
and 1
finally 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
Miss 1
Helen 1
Stoner 1
heard 1
a 1
metallic 1
clang 1
which 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
caused 1
by 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
metal 1
bars 1
that 1
secured 1
the 1
shutters 1
falling 1
back 1
into 1
its 1
place 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
good 1
ground 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
the 1
mystery 1
may 1
be 1
cleared 1
along 1
those 1
lines 1
But 1
what 1
then 1
did 1
the 1
gipsies 1
do 1
I 1
cannot 1
imagine 1
I 1
see 1
many 1
objections 1
to 1
any 1
such 1
theory 1
And 1
so 1
do 1
I 1
It 1
is 1
precisely 1
for 1
that 1
reason 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
Stoke 1
Moran 1
this 1
day 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
whether 1
the 1
objections 1
are 1
fatal 1
or 1
if 1
they 1
may 1
be 1
explained 1
away 1
But 1
what 1
in 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
devil 1
The 1
ejaculation 1
had 1
been 1
drawn 1
from 1
my 1
companion 1
by 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
our 1
door 1
had 1
been 1
suddenly 1
dashed 1
open 1
and 1
that 1
a 1
huge 1
man 1
had 1
framed 1
himself 1
in 1
the 1
aperture 1
His 1
costume 1
was 1
a 1
peculiar 1
mixture 1
of 1
the 1
professional 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
agricultural 1
having 1
a 1
black 1
top 1
hat 1
a 1
long 1
frock 1
coat 1
and 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
high 1
gaiters 1
with 1
a 1
hunting 1
crop 1
swinging 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
So 1
tall 1
was 1
he 1
that 1
his 1
hat 1
actually 1
brushed 1
the 1
cross 1
bar 1
of 1
the 1
doorway 1
and 1
his 1
breadth 1
seemed 1
to 1
span 1
it 1
across 1
from 1
side 1
to 1
side 1
A 1
large 1
face 1
seared 1
with 1
a 1
thousand 1
wrinkles 1
burned 1
yellow 1
with 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
marked 1
with 1
every 1
evil 1
passion 1
was 1
turned 1
from 1
one 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
of 1
us 1
while 1
his 1
deep 1
set 1
bile 1
shot 1
eyes 1
and 1
his 1
high 1
thin 1
fleshless 1
nose 1
gave 1
him 1
somewhat 1
the 1
resemblance 1
to 1
a 1
fierce 1
old 1
bird 1
of 1
prey 1
Which 1
of 1
you 1
is 1
Holmes 1
asked 1
this 1
apparition 1
My 1
name 1
sir 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
advantage 1
of 1
me 1
said 1
my 1
companion 1
quietly 1
I 1
am 1
Dr 1
Grimesby 1
Roylott 1
of 1
Stoke 1
Moran 1
Indeed 1
Doctor 1
said 1
Holmes 1
blandly 1
Pray 1
take 1
a 1
seat 1
I 1
will 1
do 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
My 1
stepdaughter 1
has 1
been 1
here 1
I 1
have 1
traced 1
her 1
What 1
has 1
she 1
been 1
saying 1
to 1
you 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
cold 1
for 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
the 1
year 1
said 1
Holmes 1
What 1
has 1
she 1
been 1
saying 1
to 1
you 1
screamed 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
furiously 1
But 1
I 1
have 1
heard 1
that 1
the 1
crocuses 1
promise 1
well 1
continued 1
my 1
companion 1
imperturbably 1
Ha 1
You 1
put 1
me 1
off 1
do 1
you 1
said 1
our 1
new 1
visitor 1
taking 1
a 1
step 1
forward 1
and 1
shaking 1
his 1
hunting 1
crop 1
I 1
know 1
you 2
scoundrel 1
I 1
have 1
heard 1
of 1
you 1
before 1
You 1
are 1
Holmes 1
the 1
meddler 1
My 1
friend 1
smiled 1
Holmes 1
the 1
busybody 1
His 1
smile 1
broadened 1
Holmes 1
the 1
Scotland 1
Yard 1
Jack 1
in 1
office 1
Holmes 1
chuckled 1
heartily 1
Your 1
conversation 1
is 1
most 1
entertaining 1
said 1
he 1
When 1
you 1
go 1
out 1
close 1
the 1
door 1
for 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
decided 1
draught 1
I 1
will 1
go 1
when 1
I 1
have 1
said 1
my 1
say 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
dare 1
to 1
meddle 1
with 1
my 1
affairs 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
Miss 1
Stoner 1
has 1
been 1
here 1
I 1
traced 1
her 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
dangerous 1
man 1
to 1
fall 1
foul 1
of 1
See 1
here 1
He 1
stepped 1
swiftly 1
forward 1
seized 1
the 1
poker 1
and 1
bent 1
it 1
into 1
a 1
curve 1
with 1
his 1
huge 1
brown 1
hands 1
See 1
that 1
you 1
keep 1
yourself 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
grip 1
he 1
snarled 1
and 1
hurling 1
the 1
twisted 1
poker 1
into 1
the 1
fireplace 1
he 1
strode 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
He 1
seems 1
a 1
very 1
amiable 1
person 1
said 1
Holmes 1
laughing 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
quite 1
so 1
bulky 1
but 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
remained 1
I 1
might 1
have 1
shown 1
him 1
that 1
my 1
grip 1
was 1
not 1
much 1
more 1
feeble 1
than 1
his 1
own 1
As 1
he 1
spoke 1
he 1
picked 1
up 1
the 1
steel 1
poker 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
sudden 1
effort 1
straightened 1
it 1
out 1
again 1
Fancy 1
his 1
having 1
the 1
insolence 1
to 1
confound 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
official 1
detective 1
force 1
This 1
incident 1
gives 1
zest 1
to 1
our 1
investigation 1
however 1
and 1
I 1
only 1
trust 1
that 1
our 1
little 1
friend 1
will 1
not 1
suffer 1
from 1
her 1
imprudence 1
in 1
allowing 1
this 1
brute 1
to 1
trace 1
her 1
And 1
now 1
Watson 1
we 1
shall 1
order 1
breakfast 1
and 1
afterwards 1
I 1
shall 1
walk 1
down 1
to 1
Doctors 1
Commons 1
where 1
I 1
hope 1
to 1
get 1
some 1
data 1
which 1
may 1
help 1
us 1
in 1
this 1
matter 1
It 1
was 1
nearly 1
one 1
o 1
clock 1
when 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
returned 1
from 1
his 1
excursion 1
He 1
held 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
a 1
sheet 1
of 1
blue 1
paper 1
scrawled 1
over 1
with 1
notes 1
and 1
figures 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
the 1
will 1
of 1
the 1
deceased 1
wife 1
said 1
he 1
To 1
determine 1
its 1
exact 1
meaning 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
obliged 1
to 1
work 1
out 1
the 1
present 1
prices 1
of 1
the 1
investments 1
with 1
which 1
it 1
is 1
concerned 1
The 1
total 1
income 1
which 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
the 1
wife 1
s 1
death 1
was 1
little 1
short 1
of 1
pounds 1
is 1
now 1
through 1
the 1
fall 1
in 1
agricultural 1
prices 1
not 1
more 1
than 1
pounds 1
Each 1
daughter 1
can 1
claim 1
an 1
income 1
of 1
pounds 1
in 1
case 1
of 1
marriage 1
It 1
is 1
evident 1
therefore 1
that 1
if 1
both 1
girls 1
had 1
married 1
this 1
beauty 1
would 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
mere 1
pittance 1
while 1
even 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
would 1
cripple 1
him 1
to 1
a 1
very 1
serious 1
extent 1
My 1
morning 1
s 1
work 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
wasted 1
since 1
it 1
has 1
proved 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
the 1
very 1
strongest 1
motives 1
for 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
And 1
now 1
Watson 1
this 1
is 1
too 1
serious 1
for 1
dawdling 1
especially 1
as 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
is 1
aware 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
interesting 1
ourselves 1
in 1
his 1
affairs 1
so 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
ready 1
we 1
shall 1
call 1
a 1
cab 1
and 1
drive 1
to 1
Waterloo 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
very 1
much 1
obliged 1
if 1
you 1
would 1
slip 1
your 1
revolver 1
into 1
your 1
pocket 1
An 1
Eley 1
s 1
No 1
is 1
an 1
excellent 1
argument 1
with 1
gentlemen 1
who 1
can 1
twist 1
steel 1
pokers 1
into 1
knots 1
That 1
and 1
a 1
tooth 1
brush 1
are 1
I 1
think 1
all 1
that 1
we 1
need 1
At 1
Waterloo 1
we 1
were 1
fortunate 1
in 1
catching 1
a 1
train 1
for 1
Leatherhead 1
where 1
we 1
hired 1
a 1
trap 1
at 1
the 1
station 1
inn 1
and 1
drove 1
for 1
four 1
or 1
five 1
miles 1
through 1
the 1
lovely 1
Surrey 1
lanes 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
perfect 1
day 1
with 1
a 1
bright 1
sun 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
fleecy 1
clouds 1
in 1
the 1
heavens 1
The 1
trees 1
and 1
wayside 1
hedges 1
were 1
just 1
throwing 1
out 1
their 1
first 1
green 1
shoots 1
and 1
the 1
air 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
the 1
pleasant 1
smell 1
of 1
the 1
moist 1
earth 1
To 1
me 1
at 1
least 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
strange 1
contrast 1
between 1
the 1
sweet 1
promise 1
of 1
the 1
spring 1
and 1
this 1
sinister 1
quest 1
upon 1
which 1
we 1
were 1
engaged 1
My 1
companion 1
sat 1
in 1
the 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
trap 1
his 1
arms 1
folded 1
his 1
hat 1
pulled 1
down 1
over 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
his 1
chin 1
sunk 1
upon 1
his 1
breast 1
buried 1
in 1
the 1
deepest 1
thought 1
Suddenly 1
however 1
he 1
started 1
tapped 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
shoulder 1
and 1
pointed 1
over 1
the 1
meadows 1
Look 1
there 1
said 1
he 1
A 1
heavily 1
timbered 1
park 1
stretched 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
gentle 1
slope 1
thickening 1
into 1
a 1
grove 1
at 1
the 1
highest 1
point 1
From 1
amid 1
the 1
branches 1
there 1
jutted 1
out 1
the 1
grey 1
gables 1
and 1
high 1
roof 1
tree 1
of 1
a 1
very 1
old 1
mansion 1
Stoke 1
Moran 1
said 1
he 1
Yes 1
sir 1
that 1
be 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
Dr 1
Grimesby 1
Roylott 1
remarked 1
the 1
driver 1
There 1
is 1
some 1
building 1
going 1
on 1
there 1
said 1
Holmes 1
that 1
is 1
where 1
we 1
are 1
going 1
There 1
s 1
the 1
village 1
said 1
the 1
driver 1
pointing 1
to 1
a 1
cluster 1
of 1
roofs 1
some 1
distance 1
to 1
the 1
left 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
get 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
you 1
ll 1
find 1
it 1
shorter 1
to 1
get 1
over 1
this 1
stile 1
and 1
so 1
by 1
the 1
foot 1
path 1
over 1
the 1
fields 1
There 1
it 1
is 1
where 1
the 1
lady 1
is 1
walking 1
And 1
the 1
lady 1
I 1
fancy 1
is 1
Miss 1
Stoner 1
observed 1
Holmes 1
shading 1
his 1
eyes 1
Yes 1
I 1
think 1
we 1
had 1
better 1
do 1
as 1
you 1
suggest 1
We 1
got 1
off 1
paid 1
our 1
fare 1
and 1
the 1
trap 1
rattled 1
back 1
on 1
its 1
way 1
to 1
Leatherhead 1
I 1
thought 1
it 1
as 1
well 1
said 1
Holmes 1
as 1
we 1
climbed 1
the 1
stile 1
that 1
this 1
fellow 1
should 1
think 1
we 1
had 1
come 1
here 1
as 1
architects 1
or 1
on 1
some 1
definite 1
business 1
It 1
may 1
stop 1
his 1
gossip 1
Good 1
afternoon 1
Miss 1
Stoner 1
You 1
see 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
our 1
word 1
Our 1
client 1
of 1
the 1
morning 1
had 1
hurried 1
forward 1
to 1
meet 1
us 1
with 1
a 1
face 1
which 1
spoke 1
her 1
joy 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
waiting 1
so 1
eagerly 1
for 1
you 1
she 1
cried 1
shaking 1
hands 1
with 1
us 1
warmly 1
All 1
has 1
turned 1
out 1
splendidly 1
Dr 1
Roylott 1
has 1
gone 1
to 1
town 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
unlikely 1
that 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
back 1
before 1
evening 1
We 1
have 1
had 1
the 1
pleasure 1
of 1
making 1
the 1
doctor 1
s 1
acquaintance 1
said 1
Holmes 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
he 1
sketched 1
out 1
what 1
had 1
occurred 1
Miss 1
Stoner 1
turned 1
white 1
to 1
the 1
lips 1
as 1
she 1
listened 1
Good 1
heavens 1
she 1
cried 1
he 1
has 1
followed 1
me 1
then 1
So 1
it 1
appears 1
He 1
is 1
so 1
cunning 1
that 1
I 1
never 1
know 1
when 1
I 1
am 1
safe 1
from 1
him 1
What 1
will 1
he 1
say 1
when 1
he 1
returns 1
He 1
must 1
guard 1
himself 1
for 1
he 1
may 1
find 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
someone 1
more 1
cunning 1
than 1
himself 1
upon 1
his 1
track 1
You 1
must 1
lock 1
yourself 1
up 1
from 1
him 1
to 1
night 1
If 1
he 1
is 1
violent 1
we 1
shall 1
take 1
you 1
away 1
to 1
your 1
aunt 1
s 1
at 1
Harrow 1
Now 1
we 1
must 1
make 1
the 1
best 1
use 1
of 1
our 1
time 1
so 1
kindly 1
take 1
us 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
the 1
rooms 1
which 1
we 1
are 1
to 1
examine 1
The 1
building 1
was 1
of 1
grey 1
lichen 1
blotched 1
stone 1
with 1
a 1
high 1
central 1
portion 1
and 1
two 1
curving 1
wings 1
like 1
the 1
claws 1
of 1
a 1
crab 1
thrown 1
out 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
In 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
wings 1
the 1
windows 1
were 1
broken 1
and 1
blocked 1
with 1
wooden 1
boards 1
while 1
the 1
roof 1
was 1
partly 1
caved 1
in 1
a 1
picture 1
of 1
ruin 1
The 1
central 1
portion 1
was 1
in 1
little 1
better 1
repair 1
but 1
the 1
right 1
hand 1
block 1
was 1
comparatively 1
modern 1
and 1
the 1
blinds 1
in 1
the 1
windows 1
with 1
the 1
blue 1
smoke 1
curling 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
chimneys 1
showed 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
where 1
the 1
family 1
resided 1
Some 1
scaffolding 1
had 1
been 1
erected 1
against 1
the 1
end 1
wall 1
and 1
the 1
stone 1
work 1
had 1
been 1
broken 1
into 1
but 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
signs 1
of 1
any 1
workmen 1
at 1
the 1
moment 1
of 1
our 1
visit 1
Holmes 1
walked 1
slowly 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
ill 1
trimmed 1
lawn 1
and 1
examined 1
with 1
deep 1
attention 1
the 1
outsides 1
of 1
the 1
windows 1
This 1
I 1
take 1
it 1
belongs 1
to 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
which 1
you 1
used 1
to 1
sleep 1
the 1
centre 1
one 1
to 1
your 1
sister 1
s 1
and 1
the 1
one 1
next 1
to 1
the 1
main 1
building 1
to 1
Dr 1
Roylott 1
s 1
chamber 1
Exactly 1
so 1
But 1
I 1
am 1
now 1
sleeping 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
one 1
Pending 1
the 1
alterations 1
as 1
I 1
understand 1
By 1
the 1
way 1
there 1
does 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
any 1
very 1
pressing 1
need 1
for 1
repairs 1
at 1
that 1
end 1
wall 1
There 1
were 1
none 1
I 1
believe 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
excuse 1
to 1
move 1
me 1
from 1
my 1
room 1
Ah 1
that 1
is 1
suggestive 1
Now 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
this 1
narrow 1
wing 1
runs 1
the 1
corridor 1
from 1
which 1
these 1
three 1
rooms 1
open 1
There 1
are 1
windows 1
in 1
it 1
of 1
course 1
Yes 1
but 1
very 1
small 1
ones 1
Too 1
narrow 1
for 1
anyone 1
to 1
pass 1
through 1
As 1
you 1
both 1
locked 1
your 1
doors 1
at 1
night 1
your 1
rooms 1
were 1
unapproachable 1
from 1
that 1
side 1
Now 1
would 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
kindness 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
your 1
room 1
and 1
bar 1
your 1
shutters 1
Miss 1
Stoner 1
did 1
so 1
and 1
Holmes 1
after 1
a 1
careful 1
examination 1
through 1
the 1
open 1
window 1
endeavoured 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
to 1
force 1
the 1
shutter 1
open 1
but 1
without 1
success 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
slit 1
through 1
which 1
a 1
knife 1
could 1
be 1
passed 1
to 1
raise 1
the 1
bar 1
Then 1
with 1
his 1
lens 1
he 1
tested 1
the 1
hinges 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
of 1
solid 1
iron 1
built 1
firmly 1
into 1
the 1
massive 1
masonry 1
Hum 1
said 1
he 1
scratching 1
his 1
chin 1
in 1
some 1
perplexity 1
my 1
theory 1
certainly 1
presents 1
some 1
difficulties 1
No 1
one 1
could 1
pass 1
these 1
shutters 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
bolted 1
Well 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
if 1
the 1
inside 1
throws 1
any 1
light 1
upon 1
the 1
matter 1
A 1
small 1
side 1
door 1
led 1
into 1
the 1
whitewashed 1
corridor 1
from 1
which 1
the 1
three 1
bedrooms 1
opened 1
Holmes 1
refused 1
to 1
examine 1
the 1
third 1
chamber 1
so 1
we 1
passed 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
the 1
second 1
that 1
in 1
which 1
Miss 1
Stoner 1
was 1
now 1
sleeping 1
and 1
in 1
which 1
her 1
sister 1
had 1
met 1
with 1
her 1
fate 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
homely 1
little 1
room 1
with 1
a 1
low 1
ceiling 1
and 1
a 1
gaping 1
fireplace 1
after 1
the 1
fashion 1
of 1
old 1
country 1
houses 1
A 1
brown 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
stood 1
in 1
one 1
corner 1
a 1
narrow 1
white 1
counterpaned 1
bed 1
in 1
another 1
and 1
a 1
dressing 1
table 1
on 1
the 1
left 1
hand 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
These 1
articles 1
with 1
two 1
small 1
wicker 1
work 1
chairs 1
made 1
up 1
all 1
the 1
furniture 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
save 1
for 1
a 1
square 1
of 1
Wilton 1
carpet 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
The 1
boards 1
round 1
and 1
the 1
panelling 1
of 1
the 1
walls 1
were 1
of 1
brown 1
worm 1
eaten 1
oak 1
so 1
old 1
and 1
discoloured 1
that 1
it 1
may 1
have 1
dated 1
from 1
the 1
original 1
building 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
Holmes 1
drew 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
chairs 1
into 1
a 1
corner 1
and 1
sat 1
silent 1
while 1
his 1
eyes 1
travelled 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
and 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
taking 1
in 1
every 1
detail 1
of 1
the 1
apartment 1
Where 1
does 1
that 1
bell 1
communicate 1
with 1
he 1
asked 1
at 1
last 1
pointing 1
to 1
a 1
thick 1
bell 1
rope 1
which 1
hung 1
down 1
beside 1
the 1
bed 1
the 1
tassel 1
actually 1
lying 1
upon 1
the 1
pillow 1
It 1
goes 1
to 1
the 1
housekeeper 1
s 1
room 1
It 1
looks 1
newer 1
than 1
the 1
other 1
things 1
Yes 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
put 1
there 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
years 1
ago 1
Your 1
sister 1
asked 1
for 1
it 1
I 1
suppose 1
No 1
I 1
never 1
heard 1
of 1
her 1
using 1
it 1
We 1
used 1
always 1
to 1
get 1
what 1
we 1
wanted 1
for 1
ourselves 1
Indeed 1
it 1
seemed 1
unnecessary 1
to 1
put 1
so 1
nice 1
a 1
bell 1
pull 1
there 1
You 1
will 1
excuse 1
me 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
while 1
I 1
satisfy 1
myself 1
as 1
to 1
this 1
floor 1
He 1
threw 1
himself 1
down 1
upon 1
his 1
face 1
with 1
his 1
lens 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
crawled 1
swiftly 1
backward 1
and 1
forward 1
examining 1
minutely 1
the 1
cracks 1
between 1
the 1
boards 1
Then 1
he 1
did 1
the 1
same 1
with 1
the 1
wood 1
work 1
with 1
which 1
the 1
chamber 1
was 1
panelled 1
Finally 1
he 1
walked 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
bed 1
and 1
spent 1
some 1
time 1
in 1
staring 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
in 1
running 1
his 1
eye 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
wall 1
Finally 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
bell 1
rope 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
gave 1
it 1
a 1
brisk 1
tug 1
Why 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
dummy 1
said 1
he 1
Won 1
t 1
it 1
ring 1
No 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
even 1
attached 1
to 1
a 1
wire 1
This 1
is 1
very 1
interesting 1
You 1
can 1
see 1
now 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
fastened 1
to 1
a 1
hook 1
just 1
above 1
where 1
the 1
little 1
opening 1
for 1
the 1
ventilator 1
is 1
How 1
very 1
absurd 1
I 1
never 1
noticed 1
that 1
before 1
Very 1
strange 1
muttered 1
Holmes 1
pulling 1
at 1
the 1
rope 1
There 1
are 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
very 1
singular 1
points 1
about 1
this 1
room 1
For 1
example 1
what 1
a 1
fool 1
a 1
builder 1
must 1
be 1
to 1
open 1
a 1
ventilator 1
into 1
another 1
room 1
when 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
trouble 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
communicated 1
with 1
the 1
outside 1
air 1
That 1
is 1
also 1
quite 1
modern 1
said 1
the 1
lady 1
Done 1
about 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
as 1
the 1
bell 1
rope 1
remarked 1
Holmes 1
Yes 1
there 1
were 1
several 1
little 1
changes 1
carried 1
out 1
about 1
that 1
time 1
They 1
seem 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
of 1
a 1
most 1
interesting 1
character 1
dummy 1
bell 1
ropes 1
and 1
ventilators 1
which 1
do 1
not 1
ventilate 1
With 1
your 1
permission 1
Miss 1
Stoner 1
we 1
shall 1
now 1
carry 1
our 1
researches 1
into 1
the 1
inner 1
apartment 1
Dr 1
Grimesby 1
Roylott 1
s 1
chamber 1
was 1
larger 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
his 1
step 1
daughter 1
but 1
was 1
as 1
plainly 1
furnished 1
A 1
camp 1
bed 1
a 1
small 1
wooden 1
shelf 1
full 1
of 1
books 1
mostly 1
of 1
a 1
technical 1
character 1
an 1
armchair 1
beside 1
the 1
bed 1
a 1
plain 1
wooden 1
chair 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
a 1
round 1
table 1
and 1
a 1
large 1
iron 1
safe 1
were 1
the 1
principal 1
things 1
which 1
met 1
the 1
eye 1
Holmes 1
walked 1
slowly 1
round 1
and 1
examined 1
each 1
and 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
with 1
the 1
keenest 1
interest 1
What 1
s 1
in 1
here 1
he 1
asked 1
tapping 1
the 1
safe 1
My 1
stepfather 1
s 1
business 1
papers 1
Oh 1
you 1
have 1
seen 1
inside 1
then 1
Only 1
once 1
some 1
years 1
ago 1
I 1
remember 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
papers 1
There 1
isn 1
t 1
a 1
cat 1
in 1
it 1
for 1
example 1
No 1
What 1
a 1
strange 1
idea 1
Well 1
look 1
at 1
this 1
He 1
took 1
up 1
a 1
small 1
saucer 1
of 1
milk 1
which 1
stood 1
on 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
it 1
No 1
we 1
don 1
t 1
keep 1
a 1
cat 1
But 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
cheetah 1
and 1
a 1
baboon 1
Ah 1
yes 1
of 1
course 1
Well 1
a 1
cheetah 1
is 1
just 1
a 1
big 1
cat 1
and 1
yet 1
a 1
saucer 1
of 1
milk 1
does 1
not 1
go 1
very 1
far 1
in 1
satisfying 1
its 1
wants 1
I 1
daresay 1
There 1
is 1
one 1
point 1
which 1
I 1
should 1
wish 1
to 1
determine 1
He 1
squatted 1
down 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
wooden 1
chair 1
and 1
examined 1
the 1
seat 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
attention 1
Thank 1
you 1
That 1
is 1
quite 1
settled 1
said 1
he 1
rising 1
and 1
putting 1
his 1
lens 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
Hullo 1
Here 1
is 1
something 1
interesting 1
The 1
object 1
which 1
had 1
caught 1
his 1
eye 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
dog 1
lash 1
hung 1
on 1
one 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
The 1
lash 1
however 1
was 1
curled 1
upon 1
itself 1
and 1
tied 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
loop 1
of 1
whipcord 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
make 1
of 1
that 1
Watson 1
It 1
s 1
a 1
common 1
enough 1
lash 1
But 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
why 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
tied 1
That 1
is 1
not 1
quite 1
so 1
common 1
is 1
it 1
Ah 1
me 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
wicked 1
world 1
and 1
when 1
a 1
clever 1
man 1
turns 1
his 1
brains 1
to 1
crime 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
worst 1
of 1
all 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
enough 1
now 1
Miss 1
Stoner 1
and 1
with 1
your 1
permission 1
we 1
shall 1
walk 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
lawn 1
I 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
my 1
friend 1
s 1
face 1
so 1
grim 1
or 1
his 1
brow 1
so 1
dark 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
when 1
we 1
turned 1
from 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
this 1
investigation 1
We 1
had 1
walked 1
several 1
times 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
lawn 1
neither 1
Miss 1
Stoner 1
nor 1
myself 1
liking 1
to 1
break 1
in 1
upon 1
his 1
thoughts 1
before 1
he 1
roused 1
himself 1
from 1
his 1
reverie 1
It 1
is 1
very 1
essential 1
Miss 1
Stoner 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
absolutely 1
follow 1
my 1
advice 1
in 1
every 1
respect 1
I 1
shall 1
most 1
certainly 1
do 1
so 1
The 1
matter 1
is 1
too 1
serious 1
for 1
any 1
hesitation 1
Your 1
life 1
may 1
depend 1
upon 1
your 1
compliance 1
I 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
in 1
your 1
hands 1
In 1
the 1
first 1
place 1
both 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
I 1
must 1
spend 1
the 1
night 1
in 1
your 1
room 1
Both 1
Miss 1
Stoner 1
and 1
I 1
gazed 1
at 1
him 1
in 1
astonishment 1
Yes 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
so 1
Let 1
me 1
explain 1
I 1
believe 1
that 2
is 1
the 1
village 1
inn 1
over 1
there 1
Yes 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
Crown 1
Very 1
good 1
Your 1
windows 1
would 1
be 1
visible 1
from 1
there 1
Certainly 1
You 1
must 1
confine 1
yourself 1
to 1
your 1
room 1
on 1
pretence 1
of 1
a 1
headache 1
when 1
your 1
stepfather 1
comes 1
back 1
Then 1
when 1
you 1
hear 1
him 1
retire 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
you 1
must 1
open 1
the 1
shutters 1
of 1
your 1
window 1
undo 1
the 1
hasp 1
put 1
your 1
lamp 1
there 1
as 1
a 1
signal 1
to 1
us 1
and 1
then 1
withdraw 1
quietly 1
with 1
everything 1
which 1
you 1
are 1
likely 1
to 1
want 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
which 1
you 1
used 1
to 1
occupy 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
repairs 1
you 1
could 1
manage 1
there 1
for 1
one 1
night 1
Oh 1
yes 1
easily 1
The 1
rest 1
you 1
will 1
leave 1
in 1
our 1
hands 1
But 1
what 1
will 1
you 1
do 1
We 1
shall 1
spend 1
the 1
night 1
in 1
your 1
room 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
investigate 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
this 1
noise 1
which 1
has 1
disturbed 1
you 1
I 1
believe 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
already 1
made 1
up 1
your 1
mind 1
said 1
Miss 1
Stoner 1
laying 1
her 1
hand 1
upon 1
my 1
companion 1
s 1
sleeve 1
Perhaps 1
I 1
have 1
Then 1
for 1
pity 1
s 1
sake 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
my 1
sister 1
s 1
death 1
I 1
should 1
prefer 1
to 1
have 1
clearer 1
proofs 1
before 1
I 1
speak 1
You 1
can 1
at 1
least 1
tell 1
me 1
whether 1
my 1
own 1
thought 1
is 1
correct 1
and 1
if 1
she 1
died 1
from 1
some 1
sudden 1
fright 1
No 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
so 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
probably 1
some 1
more 1
tangible 1
cause 1
And 1
now 1
Miss 1
Stoner 1
we 1
must 1
leave 1
you 1
for 1
if 1
Dr 1
Roylott 1
returned 1
and 1
saw 1
us 1
our 1
journey 1
would 1
be 1
in 1
vain 1
Good 1
bye 1
and 1
be 1
brave 1
for 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
do 1
what 1
I 1
have 1
told 1
you 2
may 1
rest 1
assured 1
that 1
we 1
shall 1
soon 1
drive 1
away 1
the 1
dangers 1
that 1
threaten 1
you 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
difficulty 1
in 1
engaging 1
a 1
bedroom 1
and 1
sitting 1
room 1
at 1
the 1
Crown 1
Inn 1
They 1
were 1
on 1
the 1
upper 1
floor 1
and 1
from 1
our 1
window 1
we 1
could 1
command 1
a 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
avenue 1
gate 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
inhabited 1
wing 1
of 1
Stoke 1
Moran 1
Manor 1
House 1
At 1
dusk 1
we 1
saw 1
Dr 1
Grimesby 1
Roylott 1
drive 1
past 1
his 1
huge 1
form 1
looming 1
up 1
beside 1
the 1
little 1
figure 1
of 1
the 1
lad 1
who 1
drove 1
him 1
The 1
boy 1
had 1
some 1
slight 1
difficulty 1
in 1
undoing 1
the 1
heavy 1
iron 1
gates 1
and 1
we 1
heard 1
the 1
hoarse 1
roar 1
of 1
the 1
doctor 1
s 1
voice 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
fury 1
with 1
which 1
he 1
shook 1
his 1
clinched 1
fists 1
at 1
him 1
The 1
trap 1
drove 1
on 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
later 1
we 1
saw 1
a 1
sudden 1
light 1
spring 1
up 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
as 1
the 1
lamp 1
was 1
lit 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
sitting 1
rooms 1
Do 1
you 1
know 1
Watson 1
said 1
Holmes 1
as 1
we 1
sat 1
together 1
in 1
the 1
gathering 1
darkness 1
I 1
have 1
really 1
some 1
scruples 1
as 1
to 1
taking 1
you 1
to 1
night 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
distinct 1
element 1
of 1
danger 1
Can 1
I 1
be 1
of 1
assistance 1
Your 1
presence 1
might 1
be 1
invaluable 1
Then 1
I 1
shall 1
certainly 1
come 1
It 1
is 1
very 1
kind 1
of 1
you 1
You 1
speak 1
of 1
danger 1
You 1
have 1
evidently 1
seen 1
more 1
in 1
these 1
rooms 1
than 1
was 1
visible 1
to 1
me 1
No 1
but 1
I 1
fancy 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
have 1
deduced 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
I 1
imagine 1
that 1
you 1
saw 1
all 1
that 1
I 1
did 1
I 1
saw 1
nothing 1
remarkable 1
save 1
the 1
bell 1
rope 1
and 1
what 1
purpose 1
that 1
could 1
answer 1
I 1
confess 1
is 1
more 1
than 1
I 1
can 1
imagine 1
You 1
saw 1
the 1
ventilator 1
too 1
Yes 1
but 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
such 1
a 1
very 1
unusual 1
thing 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
small 1
opening 1
between 1
two 1
rooms 1
It 1
was 1
so 1
small 1
that 1
a 1
rat 1
could 1
hardly 1
pass 1
through 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
find 1
a 1
ventilator 1
before 1
ever 1
we 1
came 1
to 1
Stoke 1
Moran 1
My 1
dear 1
Holmes 1
Oh 1
yes 1
I 1
did 1
You 1
remember 1
in 1
her 1
statement 1
she 1
said 1
that 1
her 1
sister 1
could 1
smell 1
Dr 1
Roylott 1
s 1
cigar 1
Now 1
of 1
course 1
that 1
suggested 1
at 1
once 1
that 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
communication 1
between 1
the 1
two 1
rooms 1
It 1
could 1
only 1
be 1
a 1
small 1
one 1
or 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
remarked 1
upon 1
at 1
the 1
coroner 1
s 1
inquiry 1
I 1
deduced 1
a 1
ventilator 1
But 1
what 1
harm 1
can 1
there 1
be 1
in 1
that 1
Well 1
there 1
is 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
curious 1
coincidence 1
of 1
dates 1
A 1
ventilator 1
is 1
made 1
a 1
cord 1
is 1
hung 1
and 1
a 1
lady 1
who 1
sleeps 1
in 1
the 1
bed 1
dies 1
Does 1
not 1
that 1
strike 1
you 1
I 1
cannot 1
as 1
yet 1
see 1
any 1
connection 1
Did 1
you 1
observe 1
anything 1
very 1
peculiar 1
about 1
that 1
bed 1
No 1
It 1
was 1
clamped 1
to 1
the 1
floor 1
Did 1
you 1
ever 1
see 1
a 1
bed 1
fastened 1
like 1
that 1
before 1
I 1
cannot 1
say 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
The 1
lady 1
could 1
not 1
move 1
her 1
bed 1
It 1
must 1
always 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
relative 1
position 1
to 1
the 1
ventilator 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
rope 1
or 1
so 1
we 1
may 1
call 1
it 1
since 1
it 1
was 1
clearly 1
never 1
meant 1
for 1
a 1
bell 1
pull 1
Holmes 1
I 1
cried 1
I 1
seem 1
to 1
see 1
dimly 1
what 1
you 1
are 1
hinting 1
at 1
We 1
are 1
only 1
just 1
in 1
time 1
to 1
prevent 1
some 1
subtle 1
and 1
horrible 1
crime 1
Subtle 1
enough 1
and 1
horrible 1
enough 1
When 1
a 1
doctor 1
does 1
go 1
wrong 1
he 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
of 1
criminals 1
He 1
has 1
nerve 1
and 1
he 1
has 1
knowledge 1
Palmer 1
and 1
Pritchard 1
were 1
among 1
the 1
heads 1
of 1
their 1
profession 1
This 1
man 1
strikes 1
even 1
deeper 1
but 1
I 1
think 1
Watson 1
that 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
strike 1
deeper 1
still 1
But 1
we 1
shall 1
have 1
horrors 1
enough 1
before 1
the 1
night 1
is 1
over 1
for 1
goodness 1
sake 1
let 1
us 1
have 1
a 1
quiet 1
pipe 1
and 1
turn 1
our 1
minds 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
to 1
something 1
more 1
cheerful 1
About 1
nine 1
o 1
clock 1
the 1
light 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
was 1
extinguished 1
and 1
all 1
was 1
dark 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
Manor 1
House 1
Two 1
hours 1
passed 1
slowly 1
away 1
and 1
then 1
suddenly 1
just 1
at 1
the 1
stroke 1
of 1
eleven 1
a 1
single 1
bright 1
light 1
shone 1
out 1
right 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
us 1
That 1
is 1
our 1
signal 1
said 1
Holmes 1
springing 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
it 1
comes 1
from 1
the 1
middle 1
window 1
As 1
we 1
passed 1
out 1
he 1
exchanged 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
with 1
the 1
landlord 1
explaining 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
going 1
on 1
a 1
late 1
visit 1
to 1
an 1
acquaintance 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
possible 1
that 1
we 1
might 1
spend 1
the 1
night 1
there 1
A 1
moment 1
later 1
we 1
were 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
dark 1
road 1
a 1
chill 1
wind 1
blowing 1
in 1
our 1
faces 1
and 1
one 1
yellow 1
light 1
twinkling 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
us 1
through 1
the 1
gloom 1
to 1
guide 1
us 1
on 1
our 1
sombre 1
errand 1
There 1
was 1
little 1
difficulty 1
in 1
entering 1
the 1
grounds 1
for 1
unrepaired 1
breaches 1
gaped 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
park 1
wall 1
Making 1
our 1
way 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
we 1
reached 1
the 1
lawn 1
crossed 1
it 1
and 1
were 1
about 1
to 1
enter 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
when 1
out 1
from 1
a 1
clump 1
of 1
laurel 1
bushes 1
there 1
darted 1
what 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
hideous 1
and 1
distorted 1
child 1
who 1
threw 1
itself 1
upon 1
the 1
grass 1
with 1
writhing 1
limbs 1
and 1
then 1
ran 1
swiftly 1
across 1
the 1
lawn 1
into 1
the 1
darkness 1
My 1
God 1
I 1
whispered 1
did 1
you 1
see 1
it 1
Holmes 1
was 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
as 1
startled 1
as 1
I 1
His 1
hand 1
closed 1
like 1
a 1
vice 1
upon 1
my 1
wrist 1
in 1
his 1
agitation 1
Then 1
he 1
broke 1
into 1
a 1
low 1
laugh 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
lips 1
to 1
my 1
ear 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
nice 1
household 1
he 1
murmured 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
baboon 1
I 1
had 1
forgotten 1
the 1
strange 1
pets 1
which 1
the 1
doctor 1
affected 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
cheetah 1
too 1
perhaps 1
we 1
might 1
find 1
it 1
upon 1
our 1
shoulders 1
at 1
any 1
moment 1
I 1
confess 1
that 1
I 1
felt 1
easier 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
when 1
after 1
following 1
Holmes 1
example 1
and 1
slipping 1
off 1
my 1
shoes 1
I 1
found 1
myself 1
inside 1
the 1
bedroom 1
My 1
companion 1
noiselessly 1
closed 1
the 1
shutters 1
moved 1
the 1
lamp 1
onto 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
cast 1
his 1
eyes 1
round 1
the 1
room 1
All 1
was 1
as 1
we 1
had 1
seen 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
daytime 1
Then 1
creeping 1
up 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
making 1
a 1
trumpet 1
of 1
his 1
hand 1
he 1
whispered 1
into 1
my 1
ear 1
again 1
so 1
gently 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
do 1
to 1
distinguish 1
the 1
words 1
The 1
least 1
sound 1
would 1
be 1
fatal 1
to 1
our 1
plans 1
I 1
nodded 1
to 1
show 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
heard 1
We 1
must 1
sit 1
without 1
light 1
He 1
would 1
see 1
it 1
through 1
the 1
ventilator 1
I 1
nodded 1
again 1
Do 1
not 1
go 1
asleep 1
your 1
very 1
life 1
may 1
depend 1
upon 1
it 1
Have 1
your 1
pistol 1
ready 1
in 1
case 1
we 1
should 1
need 1
it 1
I 1
will 1
sit 1
on 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
and 1
you 1
in 1
that 1
chair 1
I 1
took 1
out 1
my 1
revolver 1
and 1
laid 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
table 1
Holmes 1
had 1
brought 1
up 1
a 1
long 1
thin 1
cane 1
and 1
this 1
he 1
placed 1
upon 1
the 1
bed 1
beside 1
him 1
By 1
it 1
he 1
laid 1
the 1
box 1
of 1
matches 1
and 1
the 1
stump 1
of 1
a 1
candle 1
Then 1
he 1
turned 1
down 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
left 1
in 1
darkness 1
How 1
shall 1
I 1
ever 1
forget 1
that 1
dreadful 1
vigil 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
hear 1
a 1
sound 1
not 1
even 1
the 1
drawing 1
of 1
a 1
breath 1
and 1
yet 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
my 1
companion 1
sat 1
open 1
eyed 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
feet 1
of 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
state 1
of 1
nervous 1
tension 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
myself 1
The 1
shutters 1
cut 1
off 1
the 1
least 1
ray 1
of 1
light 1
and 1
we 1
waited 1
in 1
absolute 1
darkness 1
From 1
outside 1
came 1
the 1
occasional 1
cry 1
of 1
a 1
night 1
bird 1
and 1
once 1
at 1
our 1
very 1
window 1
a 1
long 1
drawn 1
catlike 1
whine 1
which 1
told 1
us 1
that 1
the 1
cheetah 1
was 1
indeed 1
at 1
liberty 1
Far 1
away 1
we 1
could 1
hear 1
the 1
deep 1
tones 1
of 1
the 1
parish 1
clock 1
which 1
boomed 1
out 1
every 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
How 1
long 1
they 1
seemed 1
those 1
quarters 1
Twelve 1
struck 1
and 1
one 1
and 1
two 1
and 1
three 1
and 1
still 1
we 1
sat 1
waiting 1
silently 1
for 1
whatever 1
might 1
befall 1
Suddenly 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
momentary 1
gleam 1
of 1
a 1
light 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
ventilator 1
which 1
vanished 1
immediately 1
but 1
was 1
succeeded 1
by 1
a 1
strong 1
smell 1
of 1
burning 1
oil 1
and 1
heated 1
metal 1
Someone 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
had 1
lit 1
a 1
dark 1
lantern 1
I 1
heard 1
a 1
gentle 1
sound 1
of 1
movement 1
and 1
then 1
all 1
was 1
silent 1
once 1
more 1
though 1
the 1
smell 1
grew 1
stronger 1
For 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
I 1
sat 1
with 1
straining 1
ears 1
Then 1
suddenly 1
another 1
sound 1
became 1
audible 1
a 1
very 1
gentle 1
soothing 1
sound 1
like 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
small 1
jet 1
of 1
steam 1
escaping 1
continually 1
from 1
a 1
kettle 1
The 1
instant 1
that 1
we 1
heard 1
it 1
Holmes 1
sprang 1
from 1
the 1
bed 1
struck 1
a 1
match 1
and 1
lashed 1
furiously 1
with 1
his 1
cane 1
at 1
the 1
bell 1
pull 1
You 1
see 1
it 1
Watson 1
he 1
yelled 1
You 1
see 1
it 1
But 1
I 1
saw 1
nothing 1
At 1
the 1
moment 1
when 1
Holmes 1
struck 1
the 1
light 1
I 1
heard 1
a 1
low 1
clear 1
whistle 1
but 1
the 1
sudden 1
glare 1
flashing 1
into 1
my 1
weary 1
eyes 1
made 1
it 1
impossible 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
tell 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
at 1
which 1
my 1
friend 1
lashed 1
so 1
savagely 1
I 1
could 1
however 1
see 1
that 1
his 1
face 1
was 1
deadly 1
pale 1
and 1
filled 1
with 1
horror 1
and 1
loathing 1
He 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
strike 1
and 1
was 1
gazing 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
ventilator 1
when 1
suddenly 1
there 1
broke 1
from 1
the 1
silence 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
the 1
most 1
horrible 1
cry 1
to 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
listened 1
It 1
swelled 1
up 1
louder 1
and 1
louder 1
a 1
hoarse 1
yell 1
of 1
pain 1
and 1
fear 1
and 1
anger 1
all 1
mingled 1
in 1
the 1
one 1
dreadful 1
shriek 1
They 1
say 1
that 1
away 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
even 1
in 1
the 1
distant 1
parsonage 1
that 1
cry 1
raised 1
the 1
sleepers 1
from 1
their 1
beds 1
It 1
struck 1
cold 1
to 1
our 1
hearts 1
and 1
I 1
stood 1
gazing 1
at 1
Holmes 1
and 1
he 1
at 1
me 1
until 1
the 1
last 1
echoes 1
of 1
it 1
had 1
died 1
away 1
into 1
the 1
silence 1
from 1
which 1
it 1
rose 1
What 1
can 1
it 1
mean 1
I 1
gasped 1
It 1
means 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
over 1
Holmes 1
answered 1
And 1
perhaps 1
after 1
all 1
it 1
is 1
for 1
the 1
best 1
Take 1
your 1
pistol 1
and 1
we 1
will 1
enter 1
Dr 1
Roylott 1
s 1
room 1
With 1
a 1
grave 1
face 1
he 1
lit 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
led 1
the 1
way 1
down 1
the 1
corridor 1
Twice 1
he 1
struck 1
at 1
the 1
chamber 1
door 1
without 1
any 1
reply 1
from 1
within 1
Then 1
he 1
turned 1
the 1
handle 1
and 1
entered 1
I 1
at 1
his 1
heels 1
with 1
the 1
cocked 1
pistol 1
in 1
my 1
hand 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
singular 1
sight 1
which 1
met 1
our 1
eyes 1
On 1
the 1
table 1
stood 1
a 1
dark 1
lantern 1
with 1
the 1
shutter 1
half 1
open 1
throwing 1
a 1
brilliant 1
beam 1
of 1
light 1
upon 1
the 1
iron 1
safe 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
which 1
was 1
ajar 1
Beside 1
this 1
table 1
on 1
the 1
wooden 1
chair 1
sat 1
Dr 1
Grimesby 1
Roylott 1
clad 1
in 1
a 1
long 1
grey 1
dressing 1
gown 1
his 1
bare 1
ankles 1
protruding 1
beneath 1
and 1
his 1
feet 1
thrust 1
into 1
red 1
heelless 1
Turkish 1
slippers 1
Across 1
his 1
lap 1
lay 1
the 1
short 1
stock 1
with 1
the 1
long 1
lash 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
noticed 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
His 1
chin 1
was 1
cocked 1
upward 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
fixed 1
in 1
a 1
dreadful 1
rigid 1
stare 1
at 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
ceiling 1
Round 1
his 1
brow 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
peculiar 1
yellow 1
band 1
with 1
brownish 1
speckles 1
which 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
bound 1
tightly 1
round 1
his 1
head 1
As 1
we 1
entered 1
he 1
made 1
neither 1
sound 1
nor 1
motion 1
The 1
band 1
the 1
speckled 1
band 1
whispered 1
Holmes 1
I 1
took 1
a 1
step 1
forward 1
In 1
an 1
instant 1
his 1
strange 1
headgear 1
began 1
to 1
move 1
and 1
there 1
reared 1
itself 1
from 1
among 1
his 1
hair 1
the 1
squat 1
diamond 1
shaped 1
head 1
and 1
puffed 1
neck 1
of 1
a 1
loathsome 1
serpent 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
swamp 1
adder 1
cried 1
Holmes 1
the 1
deadliest 1
snake 1
in 1
India 1
He 1
has 1
died 1
within 1
ten 1
seconds 1
of 1
being 1
bitten 1
Violence 1
does 1
in 1
truth 1
recoil 1
upon 1
the 1
violent 1
and 1
the 1
schemer 1
falls 1
into 1
the 1
pit 1
which 1
he 1
digs 1
for 1
another 1
Let 1
us 1
thrust 1
this 1
creature 1
back 1
into 1
its 1
den 1
and 1
we 1
can 1
then 1
remove 1
Miss 1
Stoner 1
to 1
some 1
place 1
of 1
shelter 1
and 1
let 1
the 1
county 1
police 1
know 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
As 1
he 1
spoke 1
he 1
drew 1
the 1
dog 1
whip 1
swiftly 1
from 1
the 1
dead 1
man 1
s 1
lap 1
and 1
throwing 1
the 1
noose 1
round 1
the 1
reptile 1
s 1
neck 1
he 1
drew 1
it 1
from 1
its 1
horrid 1
perch 1
and 1
carrying 1
it 1
at 1
arm 1
s 1
length 1
threw 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
iron 1
safe 1
which 1
he 1
closed 1
upon 1
it 1
Such 1
are 1
the 1
true 1
facts 1
of 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
Dr 1
Grimesby 1
Roylott 1
of 1
Stoke 1
Moran 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
necessary 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
prolong 1
a 1
narrative 1
which 1
has 1
already 1
run 1
to 1
too 1
great 1
a 1
length 1
by 1
telling 1
how 1
we 1
broke 1
the 1
sad 1
news 1
to 1
the 1
terrified 1
girl 1
how 1
we 1
conveyed 1
her 1
by 1
the 1
morning 1
train 1
to 1
the 1
care 1
of 1
her 1
good 1
aunt 1
at 1
Harrow 1
of 1
how 1
the 1
slow 1
process 1
of 1
official 1
inquiry 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
conclusion 1
that 1
the 1
doctor 1
met 1
his 1
fate 1
while 1
indiscreetly 1
playing 1
with 1
a 1
dangerous 1
pet 1
The 1
little 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
yet 1
to 1
learn 1
of 1
the 1
case 1
was 1
told 1
me 1
by 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
as 1
we 1
travelled 1
back 1
next 1
day 1
I 1
had 1
said 1
he 1
come 1
to 1
an 1
entirely 1
erroneous 1
conclusion 1
which 1
shows 1
my 1
dear 1
Watson 1
how 1
dangerous 1
it 1
always 1
is 1
to 1
reason 1
from 1
insufficient 1
data 1
The 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
gipsies 1
and 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
word 1
band 1
which 1
was 1
used 1
by 1
the 1
poor 1
girl 1
no 1
doubt 1
to 1
explain 1
the 1
appearance 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
caught 1
a 1
hurried 1
glimpse 1
of 1
by 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
her 1
match 1
were 1
sufficient 1
to 1
put 1
me 1
upon 1
an 1
entirely 1
wrong 1
scent 1
I 1
can 1
only 1
claim 1
the 1
merit 1
that 1
I 1
instantly 1
reconsidered 1
my 1
position 1
when 1
however 1
it 1
became 1
clear 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
whatever 1
danger 1
threatened 1
an 1
occupant 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
could 1
not 1
come 1
either 1
from 1
the 1
window 1
or 1
the 1
door 1
My 1
attention 1
was 1
speedily 1
drawn 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
already 1
remarked 1
to 1
you 1
to 1
this 1
ventilator 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
bell 1
rope 1
which 1
hung 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
bed 1
The 1
discovery 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
dummy 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
bed 1
was 1
clamped 1
to 1
the 1
floor 1
instantly 1
gave 1
rise 1
to 1
the 1
suspicion 1
that 1
the 1
rope 1
was 1
there 1
as 1
a 1
bridge 1
for 1
something 1
passing 1
through 1
the 1
hole 1
and 1
coming 1
to 1
the 1
bed 1
The 1
idea 1
of 1
a 1
snake 1
instantly 1
occurred 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
coupled 1
it 1
with 1
my 1
knowledge 1
that 1
the 1
doctor 1
was 1
furnished 1
with 1
a 1
supply 1
of 1
creatures 1
from 1
India 1
I 1
felt 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
probably 1
on 1
the 1
right 1
track 1
The 1
idea 1
of 1
using 1
a 1
form 1
of 1
poison 1
which 1
could 1
not 1
possibly 1
be 1
discovered 1
by 1
any 1
chemical 1
test 1
was 1
just 1
such 1
a 1
one 1
as 1
would 1
occur 1
to 1
a 1
clever 1
and 1
ruthless 1
man 1
who 1
had 2
an 1
Eastern 1
training 1
The 1
rapidity 1
with 1
which 1
such 1
a 1
poison 1
would 1
take 1
effect 1
would 1
also 1
from 1
his 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
be 1
an 1
advantage 1
It 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
sharp 1
eyed 1
coroner 1
indeed 1
who 1
could 1
distinguish 1
the 1
two 1
little 1
dark 1
punctures 1
which 1
would 1
show 1
where 1
the 1
poison 1
fangs 1
had 1
done 1
their 1
work 1
Then 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
whistle 1
Of 1
course 1
he 1
must 1
recall 1
the 1
snake 1
before 1
the 1
morning 1
light 1
revealed 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
victim 1
He 1
had 1
trained 1
it 1
probably 1
by 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
milk 1
which 1
we 1
saw 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
him 1
when 1
summoned 1
He 1
would 1
put 1
it 1
through 1
this 1
ventilator 1
at 1
the 1
hour 1
that 1
he 1
thought 1
best 1
with 1
the 1
certainty 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
crawl 1
down 1
the 1
rope 1
and 1
land 1
on 1
the 1
bed 1
It 1
might 1
or 1
might 1
not 1
bite 1
the 1
occupant 1
perhaps 1
she 1
might 1
escape 1
every 1
night 1
for 1
a 1
week 1
but 1
sooner 1
or 1
later 1
she 1
must 1
fall 1
a 1
victim 1
I 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
these 1
conclusions 1
before 1
ever 1
I 1
had 1
entered 1
his 1
room 1
An 1
inspection 1
of 1
his 1
chair 1
showed 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
standing 1
on 1
it 1
which 1
of 1
course 1
would 1
be 1
necessary 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
reach 1
the 1
ventilator 1
The 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
safe 1
the 1
saucer 1
of 1
milk 1
and 1
the 1
loop 1
of 1
whipcord 1
were 1
enough 1
to 1
finally 1
dispel 1
any 1
doubts 1
which 1
may 1
have 1
remained 1
The 1
metallic 1
clang 1
heard 1
by 1
Miss 1
Stoner 1
was 1
obviously 1
caused 1
by 1
her 1
stepfather 1
hastily 1
closing 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
his 1
safe 1
upon 1
its 1
terrible 1
occupant 1
Having 1
once 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
you 1
know 1
the 1
steps 1
which 1
I 1
took 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
put 1
the 1
matter 1
to 1
the 1
proof 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
creature 1
hiss 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
you 1
did 1
also 1
and 1
I 1
instantly 1
lit 1
the 1
light 1
and 1
attacked 1
it 1
With 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
driving 1
it 1
through 1
the 1
ventilator 1
And 1
also 1
with 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
causing 1
it 1
to 1
turn 1
upon 1
its 1
master 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
Some 1
of 1
the 1
blows 1
of 1
my 1
cane 1
came 1
home 1
and 1
roused 1
its 1
snakish 1
temper 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
flew 1
upon 1
the 1
first 1
person 1
it 1
saw 1
In 1
this 1
way 1
I 1
am 1
no 1
doubt 1
indirectly 1
responsible 1
for 1
Dr 1
Grimesby 1
Roylott 1
s 1
death 1
and 1
I 1
cannot 1
say 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
likely 1
to 1
weigh 1
very 1
heavily 1
upon 1
my 1
conscience 1
IX 1
THE 1
ADVENTURE 1
OF 1
THE 1
ENGINEER 1
S 1
THUMB 1
Of 1
all 1
the 1
problems 1
which 1
have 1
been 1
submitted 1
to 1
my 1
friend 1
Mr 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
for 1
solution 1
during 1
the 1
years 1
of 1
our 1
intimacy 1
there 1
were 1
only 1
two 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
introducing 1
to 1
his 1
notice 1
that 1
of 1
Mr 1
Hatherley 1
s 1
thumb 1
and 1
that 1
of 1
Colonel 1
Warburton 1
s 1
madness 1
Of 1
these 1
the 1
latter 1
may 1
have 1
afforded 1
a 1
finer 1
field 1
for 1
an 1
acute 1
and 1
original 1
observer 1
but 1
the 1
other 1
was 1
so 1
strange 1
in 1
its 1
inception 1
and 1
so 1
dramatic 1
in 1
its 1
details 1
that 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
the 1
more 1
worthy 1
of 1
being 1
placed 1
upon 1
record 1
even 1
if 1
it 1
gave 1
my 1
friend 1
fewer 1
openings 1
for 1
those 1
deductive 1
methods 1
of 1
reasoning 1
by 1
which 1
he 1
achieved 1
such 1
remarkable 1
results 1
The 1
story 1
has 1
I 1
believe 1
been 1
told 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
in 1
the 1
newspapers 1
but 1
like 1
all 1
such 1
narratives 1
its 1
effect 1
is 1
much 1
less 1
striking 1
when 1
set 1
forth 1
en 1
bloc 1
in 1
a 1
single 1
half 1
column 1
of 1
print 1
than 1
when 1
the 1
facts 1
slowly 1
evolve 1
before 1
your 1
own 1
eyes 1
and 1
the 1
mystery 1
clears 1
gradually 1
away 1
as 1
each 1
new 1
discovery 1
furnishes 1
a 1
step 1
which 1
leads 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
complete 1
truth 1
At 1
the 1
time 1
the 1
circumstances 1
made 1
a 1
deep 1
impression 1
upon 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
lapse 1
of 1
two 1
years 1
has 1
hardly 1
served 1
to 1
weaken 1
the 1
effect 1
It 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
summer 1
of 1
not 1
long 1
after 1
my 1
marriage 1
that 1
the 1
events 1
occurred 1
which 1
I 1
am 1
now 1
about 1
to 1
summarise 1
I 1
had 1
returned 1
to 1
civil 1
practice 1
and 1
had 1
finally 1
abandoned 1
Holmes 1
in 1
his 1
Baker 1
Street 1
rooms 1
although 1
I 1
continually 1
visited 1
him 1
and 1
occasionally 1
even 1
persuaded 1
him 1
to 1
forgo 1
his 1
Bohemian 1
habits 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
visit 1
us 1
My 1
practice 1
had 1
steadily 1
increased 1
and 1
as 1
I 1
happened 1
to 1
live 1
at 1
no 1
very 1
great 1
distance 1
from 1
Paddington 1
Station 1
I 1
got 1
a 1
few 1
patients 1
from 1
among 1
the 1
officials 1
One 1
of 1
these 1
whom 1
I 1
had 1
cured 1
of 1
a 1
painful 1
and 1
lingering 1
disease 1
was 1
never 1
weary 1
of 1
advertising 1
my 1
virtues 1
and 1
of 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
send 1
me 1
on 1
every 1
sufferer 1
over 1
whom 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
any 1
influence 1
One 1
morning 1
at 1
a 1
little 1
before 1
seven 1
o 1
clock 1
I 1
was 1
awakened 1
by 1
the 1
maid 1
tapping 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
announce 1
that 1
two 1
men 1
had 1
come 1
from 1
Paddington 1
and 1
were 1
waiting 1
in 1
the 1
consulting 1
room 1
I 1
dressed 1
hurriedly 1
for 1
I 1
knew 1
by 1
experience 1
that 1
railway 1
cases 1
were 1
seldom 1
trivial 1
and 1
hastened 1
downstairs 1
As 1
I 1
descended 1
my 1
old 1
ally 1
the 1
guard 1
came 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
closed 1
the 1
door 1
tightly 1
behind 1
him 1
I 1
ve 1
got 1
him 1
here 1
he 1
whispered 1
jerking 1
his 1
thumb 1
over 1
his 1
shoulder 1
he 1
s 1
all 1
right 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
then 1
I 1
asked 1
for 1
his 1
manner 1
suggested 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
some 1
strange 1
creature 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
caged 1
up 1
in 1
my 1
room 1
It 1
s 1
a 1
new 1
patient 1
he 1
whispered 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
d 1
bring 1
him 1
round 1
myself 1
then 1
he 1
couldn 1
t 1
slip 1
away 1
There 1
he 1
is 1
all 1
safe 1
and 1
sound 1
I 1
must 1
go 1
now 1
Doctor 1
I 1
have 1
my 1
dooties 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
you 1
And 1
off 1
he 1
went 1
this 1
trusty 1
tout 1
without 1
even 1
giving 1
me 1
time 1
to 1
thank 1
him 1
I 1
entered 1
my 1
consulting 1
room 1
and 1
found 1
a 1
gentleman 1
seated 1
by 1
the 1
table 1
He 1
was 1
quietly 1
dressed 1
in 1
a 1
suit 1
of 1
heather 1
tweed 1
with 1
a 1
soft 1
cloth 1
cap 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
laid 1
down 1
upon 1
my 1
books 1
Round 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
hands 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
handkerchief 1
wrapped 1
which 1
was 1
mottled 1
all 1
over 1
with 1
bloodstains 1
He 1
was 1
young 1
not 1
more 1
than 1
five 1
and 1
twenty 1
I 1
should 1
say 1
with 1
a 1
strong 1
masculine 1
face 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
exceedingly 1
pale 1
and 1
gave 1
me 1
the 1
impression 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
suffering 1
from 1
some 1
strong 1
agitation 1
which 1
it 1
took 1
all 1
his 1
strength 1
of 1
mind 1
to 1
control 1
I 1
am 1
sorry 1
to 1
knock 1
you 1
up 1
so 1
early 1
Doctor 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
I 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
very 1
serious 1
accident 1
during 1
the 1
night 1
I 1
came 1
in 1
by 1
train 1
this 1
morning 1
and 1
on 1
inquiring 1
at 1
Paddington 1
as 1
to 1
where 1
I 1
might 1
find 1
a 1
doctor 1
a 1
worthy 1
fellow 1
very 1
kindly 1
escorted 1
me 1
here 1
I 1
gave 1
the 1
maid 1
a 1
card 1
but 1
I 1
see 1
that 1
she 1
has 1
left 1
it 1
upon 1
the 1
side 1
table 1
I 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
glanced 1
at 1
it 1
Mr 1
Victor 1
Hatherley 1
hydraulic 1
engineer 1
A 1
Victoria 1
Street 1
rd 1
floor 1
That 1
was 1
the 1
name 1
style 1
and 1
abode 1
of 1
my 1
morning 1
visitor 1
I 1
regret 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
kept 1
you 1
waiting 1
said 1
I 1
sitting 1
down 1
in 1
my 1
library 1
chair 1
You 1
are 1
fresh 1
from 1
a 1
night 1
journey 1
I 1
understand 1
which 1
is 1
in 1
itself 1
a 1
monotonous 1
occupation 1
Oh 1
my 1
night 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
called 1
monotonous 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
laughed 1
He 1
laughed 1
very 1
heartily 1
with 1
a 1
high 1
ringing 1
note 1
leaning 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
shaking 1
his 1
sides 1
All 1
my 1
medical 1
instincts 1
rose 1
up 1
against 1
that 1
laugh 1
Stop 1
it 1
I 1
cried 1
pull 1
yourself 1
together 1
and 1
I 1
poured 1
out 1
some 1
water 1
from 1
a 1
caraffe 1
It 1
was 1
useless 1
however 1
He 1
was 1
off 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
hysterical 1
outbursts 1
which 1
come 1
upon 1
a 1
strong 1
nature 1
when 1
some 1
great 1
crisis 1
is 1
over 1
and 1
gone 1
Presently 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
himself 1
once 1
more 1
very 1
weary 1
and 1
pale 1
looking 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
making 1
a 1
fool 1
of 1
myself 1
he 1
gasped 1
Not 1
at 1
all 1
Drink 1
this 1
I 1
dashed 1
some 1
brandy 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
the 1
colour 1
began 1
to 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
bloodless 1
cheeks 1
That 1
s 1
better 1
said 1
he 1
And 1
now 1
Doctor 1
perhaps 1
you 1
would 1
kindly 1
attend 1
to 1
my 1
thumb 1
or 1
rather 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
my 1
thumb 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
He 1
unwound 1
the 1
handkerchief 1
and 1
held 1
out 1
his 1
hand 1
It 1
gave 1
even 1
my 1
hardened 1
nerves 1
a 1
shudder 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
There 1
were 1
four 1
protruding 1
fingers 1
and 1
a 1
horrid 1
red 1
spongy 1
surface 1
where 1
the 1
thumb 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
It 1
had 1
been 1
hacked 1
or 1
torn 1
right 1
out 1
from 1
the 1
roots 1
Good 1
heavens 1
I 1
cried 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
terrible 1
injury 1
It 1
must 1
have 1
bled 1
considerably 1
Yes 1
it 1
did 1
I 1
fainted 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
done 1
and 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
senseless 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
When 1
I 1
came 1
to 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
still 1
bleeding 1
so 1
I 1
tied 1
one 1
end 1
of 1
my 1
handkerchief 1
very 1
tightly 1
round 1
the 1
wrist 1
and 1
braced 1
it 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
twig 1
Excellent 1
You 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
surgeon 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
question 1
of 1
hydraulics 1
you 1
see 1
and 1
came 1
within 1
my 1
own 1
province 1
This 1
has 1
been 1
done 1
said 1
I 1
examining 1
the 1
wound 1
by 1
a 1
very 1
heavy 1
and 1
sharp 1
instrument 1
A 1
thing 1
like 1
a 1
cleaver 1
said 1
he 1
An 1
accident 1
I 1
presume 1
By 1
no 1
means 1
What 1
a 1
murderous 1
attack 1
Very 1
murderous 1
indeed 1
You 1
horrify 1
me 1
I 1
sponged 1
the 1
wound 1
cleaned 1
it 1
dressed 1
it 1
and 1
finally 1
covered 1
it 1
over 1
with 1
cotton 1
wadding 1
and 1
carbolised 1
bandages 1
He 1
lay 1
back 1
without 1
wincing 1
though 1
he 1
bit 1
his 1
lip 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
How 1
is 1
that 1
I 1
asked 1
when 1
I 1
had 1
finished 1
Capital 1
Between 1
your 1
brandy 1
and 1
your 1
bandage 1
I 1
feel 1
a 1
new 1
man 1
I 1
was 1
very 1
weak 1
but 1
I 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
to 1
go 1
through 1
Perhaps 1
you 1
had 1
better 1
not 1
speak 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
It 1
is 1
evidently 1
trying 1
to 1
your 1
nerves 1
Oh 1
no 1
not 1
now 1
I 1
shall 1
have 1
to 1
tell 1
my 1
tale 1
to 1
the 1
police 1
but 1
between 1
ourselves 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
convincing 1
evidence 1
of 1
this 1
wound 1
of 1
mine 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
surprised 1
if 1
they 1
believed 1
my 1
statement 1
for 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
extraordinary 1
one 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
much 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
proof 1
with 1
which 1
to 1
back 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
even 1
if 1
they 1
believe 1
me 1
the 1
clues 1
which 1
I 1
can 1
give 1
them 1
are 1
so 1
vague 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
question 1
whether 1
justice 1
will 1
be 1
done 1
Ha 1
cried 1
I 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
anything 1
in 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
a 1
problem 1
which 1
you 1
desire 1
to 1
see 1
solved 1
I 1
should 1
strongly 1
recommend 1
you 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
my 1
friend 1
Mr 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
before 1
you 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
official 1
police 1
Oh 1
I 1
have 1
heard 1
of 1
that 1
fellow 1
answered 1
my 1
visitor 1
and 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
very 1
glad 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
take 1
the 1
matter 1
up 1
though 1
of 1
course 1
I 1
must 1
use 1
the 1
official 1
police 1
as 1
well 1
Would 1
you 1
give 1
me 1
an 1
introduction 1
to 1
him 1
I 1
ll 1
do 1
better 1
I 1
ll 1
take 1
you 1
round 1
to 1
him 1
myself 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
immensely 1
obliged 1
to 1
you 1
We 1
ll 1
call 1
a 1
cab 1
and 1
go 1
together 1
We 1
shall 1
just 1
be 1
in 1
time 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
little 1
breakfast 1
with 1
him 1
Do 1
you 1
feel 1
equal 1
to 1
it 1
Yes 1
I 1
shall 1
not 1
feel 1
easy 1
until 1
I 1
have 1
told 1
my 1
story 1
Then 1
my 1
servant 1
will 1
call 1
a 1
cab 1
and 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
I 1
rushed 1
upstairs 1
explained 1
the 1
matter 1
shortly 1
to 1
my 1
wife 1
and 1
in 1
five 1
minutes 1
was 1
inside 1
a 1
hansom 1
driving 1
with 1
my 1
new 1
acquaintance 1
to 1
Baker 1
Street 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
was 1
as 1
I 1
expected 1
lounging 1
about 1
his 1
sitting 1
room 1
in 1
his 1
dressing 1
gown 1
reading 1
the 1
agony 1
column 1
of 1
The 1
Times 1
and 1
smoking 1
his 1
before 1
breakfast 1
pipe 1
which 1
was 1
composed 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
plugs 1
and 1
dottles 1
left 1
from 1
his 1
smokes 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
all 1
carefully 1
dried 1
and 1
collected 1
on 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
mantelpiece 1
He 1
received 1
us 1
in 1
his 1
quietly 1
genial 1
fashion 1
ordered 1
fresh 1
rashers 1
and 1
eggs 1
and 1
joined 1
us 1
in 1
a 1
hearty 1
meal 1
When 1
it 1
was 1
concluded 1
he 1
settled 1
our 1
new 1
acquaintance 1
upon 1
the 1
sofa 1
placed 1
a 1
pillow 1
beneath 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
laid 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
brandy 1
and 1
water 1
within 1
his 1
reach 1
It 1
is 1
easy 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
your 1
experience 1
has 1
been 1
no 1
common 1
one 1
Mr 1
Hatherley 1
said 1
he 1
Pray 1
lie 1
down 1
there 1
and 1
make 1
yourself 1
absolutely 1
at 1
home 1
Tell 1
us 1
what 1
you 1
can 1
but 1
stop 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
tired 1
and 1
keep 1
up 1
your 1
strength 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
stimulant 1
Thank 1
you 1
said 1
my 1
patient 1
but 1
I 1
have 1
felt 1
another 1
man 1
since 1
the 1
doctor 1
bandaged 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
your 1
breakfast 1
has 1
completed 1
the 1
cure 1
I 1
shall 1
take 1
up 1
as 1
little 1
of 1
your 1
valuable 1
time 1
as 1
possible 1
so 1
I 1
shall 1
start 1
at 1
once 1
upon 1
my 1
peculiar 1
experiences 1
Holmes 1
sat 1
in 1
his 1
big 1
armchair 1
with 1
the 1
weary 1
heavy 1
lidded 1
expression 1
which 1
veiled 1
his 1
keen 1
and 1
eager 1
nature 1
while 1
I 1
sat 1
opposite 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
we 1
listened 1
in 1
silence 1
to 1
the 1
strange 1
story 1
which 1
our 1
visitor 1
detailed 1
to 1
us 1
You 1
must 1
know 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
an 1
orphan 1
and 1
a 1
bachelor 1
residing 1
alone 1
in 1
lodgings 1
in 1
London 1
By 1
profession 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
hydraulic 1
engineer 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
had 1
considerable 1
experience 1
of 1
my 1
work 1
during 1
the 1
seven 1
years 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
apprenticed 1
to 1
Venner 1
Matheson 1
the 1
well 1
known 1
firm 1
of 1
Greenwich 1
Two 1
years 1
ago 1
having 1
served 1
my 1
time 1
and 1
having 1
also 1
come 1
into 1
a 1
fair 1
sum 1
of 1
money 1
through 1
my 1
poor 1
father 1
s 1
death 1
I 1
determined 1
to 1
start 1
in 1
business 1
for 1
myself 1
and 1
took 1
professional 1
chambers 1
in 1
Victoria 1
Street 1
I 1
suppose 1
that 1
everyone 1
finds 1
his 1
first 1
independent 1
start 1
in 1
business 1
a 1
dreary 1
experience 1
To 1
me 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
exceptionally 1
so 1
During 1
two 1
years 1
I 1
have 1
had 1
three 1
consultations 1
and 1
one 1
small 1
job 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
absolutely 1
all 1
that 1
my 1
profession 1
has 1
brought 1
me 1
My 1
gross 1
takings 1
amount 1
to 1
pounds 1
s 1
Every 1
day 1
from 1
nine 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
until 1
four 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
I 1
waited 1
in 1
my 1
little 1
den 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
my 1
heart 1
began 1
to 1
sink 1
and 1
I 1
came 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
never 1
have 1
any 1
practice 1
at 1
all 1
Yesterday 1
however 1
just 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
thinking 1
of 1
leaving 1
the 1
office 1
my 1
clerk 1
entered 1
to 1
say 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
gentleman 1
waiting 1
who 1
wished 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
upon 1
business 1
He 1
brought 1
up 1
a 1
card 1
too 1
with 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
Colonel 1
Lysander 1
Stark 1
engraved 1
upon 1
it 1
Close 1
at 1
his 1
heels 1
came 1
the 1
colonel 1
himself 1
a 1
man 1
rather 1
over 1
the 1
middle 1
size 1
but 1
of 1
an 1
exceeding 1
thinness 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
seen 1
so 1
thin 1
a 1
man 1
His 1
whole 1
face 1
sharpened 1
away 1
into 1
nose 1
and 1
chin 1
and 1
the 1
skin 1
of 1
his 1
cheeks 1
was 1
drawn 1
quite 1
tense 1
over 1
his 1
outstanding 1
bones 1
Yet 1
this 1
emaciation 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
his 1
natural 1
habit 1
and 1
due 1
to 1
no 1
disease 1
for 1
his 1
eye 1
was 1
bright 1
his 1
step 1
brisk 1
and 1
his 1
bearing 1
assured 1
He 1
was 1
plainly 1
but 1
neatly 1
dressed 1
and 1
his 1
age 1
I 1
should 1
judge 1
would 1
be 1
nearer 1
forty 1
than 1
thirty 1
Mr 1
Hatherley 1
said 1
he 1
with 1
something 1
of 1
a 1
German 1
accent 1
You 1
have 1
been 1
recommended 1
to 1
me 1
Mr 1
Hatherley 1
as 1
being 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
not 1
only 1
proficient 1
in 1
his 1
profession 1
but 1
is 1
also 1
discreet 1
and 1
capable 1
of 1
preserving 1
a 1
secret 1
I 1
bowed 1
feeling 1
as 1
flattered 1
as 1
any 1
young 1
man 1
would 1
at 1
such 1
an 1
address 1
May 1
I 1
ask 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
who 1
gave 1
me 1
so 1
good 1
a 1
character 1
Well 1
perhaps 1
it 1
is 1
better 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
just 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
I 1
have 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
same 1
source 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
both 1
an 1
orphan 1
and 1
a 1
bachelor 1
and 1
are 1
residing 1
alone 1
in 1
London 1
That 1
is 1
quite 1
correct 1
I 1
answered 1
but 1
you 1
will 1
excuse 1
me 1
if 1
I 1
say 1
that 1
I 1
cannot 1
see 1
how 1
all 1
this 1
bears 1
upon 1
my 1
professional 1
qualifications 1
I 1
understand 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
on 1
a 1
professional 1
matter 1
that 1
you 1
wished 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
me 1
Undoubtedly 1
so 1
But 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
that 1
all 1
I 1
say 1
is 1
really 1
to 1
the 1
point 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
professional 1
commission 1
for 1
you 1
but 1
absolute 1
secrecy 1
is 1
quite 1
essential 1
absolute 1
secrecy 1
you 1
understand 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
may 1
expect 1
that 1
more 1
from 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
alone 1
than 1
from 1
one 1
who 1
lives 1
in 1
the 1
bosom 1
of 1
his 1
family 1
If 1
I 1
promise 1
to 1
keep 1
a 1
secret 1
said 1
I 1
you 1
may 1
absolutely 1
depend 1
upon 1
my 1
doing 1
so 1
He 1
looked 1
very 1
hard 1
at 1
me 1
as 1
I 1
spoke 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
so 1
suspicious 1
and 1
questioning 1
an 1
eye 1
Do 1
you 1
promise 1
then 1
said 1
he 1
at 1
last 1
Yes 1
I 1
promise 1
Absolute 1
and 1
complete 1
silence 1
before 1
during 1
and 1
after 1
No 1
reference 1
to 1
the 1
matter 1
at 1
all 1
either 1
in 1
word 1
or 1
writing 1
I 1
have 1
already 1
given 1
you 1
my 1
word 1
Very 1
good 1
He 1
suddenly 1
sprang 1
up 1
and 1
darting 1
like 1
lightning 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
he 1
flung 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
The 1
passage 1
outside 1
was 1
empty 1
That 1
s 1
all 1
right 1
said 1
he 1
coming 1
back 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
clerks 1
are 1
sometimes 1
curious 1
as 1
to 1
their 1
master 1
s 1
affairs 1
Now 1
we 1
can 1
talk 1
in 1
safety 1
He 1
drew 1
up 1
his 1
chair 1
very 1
close 1
to 1
mine 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
stare 1
at 1
me 1
again 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
questioning 1
and 1
thoughtful 1
look 1
A 1
feeling 1
of 1
repulsion 1
and 1
of 1
something 1
akin 1
to 1
fear 1
had 1
begun 1
to 1
rise 1
within 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
strange 1
antics 1
of 1
this 1
fleshless 1
man 1
Even 1
my 1
dread 1
of 1
losing 1
a 1
client 1
could 1
not 1
restrain 1
me 1
from 1
showing 1
my 1
impatience 1
I 1
beg 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
state 1
your 1
business 1
sir 1
said 1
I 1
my 1
time 1
is 1
of 1
value 1
Heaven 1
forgive 1
me 1
for 1
that 1
last 1
sentence 1
but 1
the 1
words 1
came 1
to 1
my 1
lips 1
How 1
would 1
fifty 1
guineas 1
for 1
a 1
night 1
s 1
work 1
suit 1
you 1
he 1
asked 1
Most 1
admirably 1
I 1
say 1
a 1
night 1
s 1
work 1
but 1
an 1
hour 1
s 1
would 1
be 1
nearer 1
the 1
mark 1
I 1
simply 1
want 1
your 1
opinion 1
about 1
a 1
hydraulic 1
stamping 1
machine 1
which 1
has 1
got 1
out 1
of 1
gear 1
If 1
you 1
show 1
us 1
what 1
is 1
wrong 1
we 1
shall 1
soon 1
set 1
it 1
right 1
ourselves 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
commission 1
as 1
that 1
The 1
work 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
light 1
and 1
the 1
pay 1
munificent 1
Precisely 1
so 1
We 1
shall 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
night 1
by 1
the 1
last 1
train 1
Where 1
to 1
To 1
Eyford 1
in 1
Berkshire 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
place 1
near 1
the 1
borders 1
of 1
Oxfordshire 1
and 1
within 1
seven 1
miles 1
of 1
Reading 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
train 1
from 1
Paddington 1
which 1
would 1
bring 1
you 1
there 1
at 1
about 1
Very 1
good 1
I 1
shall 1
come 1
down 1
in 1
a 1
carriage 1
to 1
meet 1
you 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
drive 1
then 1
Yes 1
our 1
little 1
place 1
is 1
quite 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
good 1
seven 1
miles 1
from 1
Eyford 1
Station 1
Then 1
we 1
can 1
hardly 1
get 1
there 1
before 1
midnight 1
I 1
suppose 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
no 1
chance 1
of 1
a 1
train 1
back 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
compelled 1
to 1
stop 1
the 1
night 1
Yes 1
we 1
could 1
easily 1
give 1
you 1
a 1
shake 1
down 1
That 1
is 1
very 1
awkward 1
Could 1
I 1
not 1
come 1
at 1
some 1
more 1
convenient 1
hour 1
We 1
have 1
judged 1
it 1
best 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
come 1
late 1
It 1
is 1
to 1
recompense 1
you 1
for 1
any 1
inconvenience 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
paying 1
to 1
you 1
a 1
young 1
and 1
unknown 1
man 1
a 1
fee 1
which 1
would 1
buy 1
an 1
opinion 1
from 1
the 1
very 1
heads 1
of 1
your 1
profession 1
Still 1
of 1
course 1
if 1
you 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
draw 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
business 1
there 1
is 1
plenty 1
of 1
time 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
fifty 1
guineas 1
and 1
of 1
how 1
very 1
useful 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
me 1
Not 1
at 1
all 1
said 1
I 2
shall 1
be 1
very 1
happy 1
to 1
accommodate 1
myself 1
to 1
your 1
wishes 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
however 1
to 1
understand 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
clearly 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
you 1
wish 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
Quite 1
so 1
It 1
is 1
very 1
natural 1
that 1
the 1
pledge 1
of 1
secrecy 1
which 1
we 1
have 1
exacted 1
from 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
aroused 1
your 1
curiosity 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
wish 1
to 1
commit 1
you 1
to 1
anything 1
without 1
your 1
having 1
it 1
all 1
laid 1
before 1
you 1
I 1
suppose 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
absolutely 1
safe 1
from 1
eavesdroppers 1
Entirely 1
Then 1
the 1
matter 1
stands 1
thus 1
You 1
are 1
probably 1
aware 1
that 1
fuller 1
s 1
earth 1
is 1
a 1
valuable 1
product 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
found 1
in 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
places 1
in 1
England 1
I 1
have 1
heard 1
so 1
Some 1
little 1
time 1
ago 1
I 1
bought 1
a 1
small 1
place 1
a 1
very 1
small 1
place 1
within 1
ten 1
miles 1
of 1
Reading 1
I 1
was 1
fortunate 1
enough 1
to 1
discover 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
deposit 1
of 1
fuller 1
s 1
earth 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
fields 1
On 1
examining 1
it 1
however 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
this 1
deposit 1
was 1
a 1
comparatively 1
small 1
one 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
formed 1
a 1
link 1
between 1
two 1
very 1
much 1
larger 1
ones 1
upon 1
the 1
right 1
and 1
left 1
both 1
of 1
them 1
however 1
in 1
the 1
grounds 1
of 1
my 1
neighbours 1
These 1
good 1
people 1
were 1
absolutely 1
ignorant 1
that 1
their 1
land 1
contained 1
that 1
which 1
was 1
quite 1
as 1
valuable 1
as 1
a 1
gold 1
mine 1
Naturally 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
my 1
interest 1
to 1
buy 1
their 1
land 1
before 1
they 1
discovered 1
its 1
true 1
value 1
but 1
unfortunately 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
capital 1
by 1
which 1
I 1
could 1
do 1
this 1
I 1
took 1
a 1
few 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
into 1
the 1
secret 1
however 1
and 1
they 1
suggested 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
quietly 1
and 1
secretly 1
work 1
our 1
own 1
little 1
deposit 1
and 1
that 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
we 1
should 1
earn 1
the 1
money 1
which 1
would 1
enable 1
us 1
to 1
buy 1
the 1
neighbouring 1
fields 1
This 1
we 1
have 1
now 1
been 1
doing 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
and 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
help 1
us 1
in 1
our 1
operations 1
we 1
erected 1
a 1
hydraulic 1
press 1
This 1
press 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
already 1
explained 1
has 1
got 1
out 1
of 1
order 1
and 1
we 1
wish 1
your 1
advice 1
upon 1
the 1
subject 1
We 1
guard 1
our 1
secret 1
very 1
jealously 1
however 1
and 1
if 1
it 1
once 1
became 1
known 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
hydraulic 1
engineers 1
coming 1
to 1
our 1
little 1
house 1
it 1
would 1
soon 1
rouse 1
inquiry 1
and 1
then 1
if 1
the 1
facts 1
came 1
out 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
good 1
bye 1
to 1
any 1
chance 1
of 1
getting 1
these 1
fields 1
and 1
carrying 1
out 1
our 1
plans 1
That 1
is 1
why 1
I 1
have 1
made 1
you 1
promise 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
tell 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
Eyford 1
to 1
night 1
I 1
hope 1
that 1
I 1
make 1
it 1
all 1
plain 1
I 1
quite 1
follow 1
you 1
said 1
I 1
The 1
only 1
point 1
which 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
quite 1
understand 1
was 1
what 1
use 1
you 1
could 1
make 1
of 1
a 1
hydraulic 1
press 1
in 1
excavating 1
fuller 1
s 1
earth 1
which 1
as 1
I 1
understand 1
is 1
dug 1
out 1
like 1
gravel 1
from 1
a 1
pit 1
Ah 1
said 1
he 1
carelessly 1
we 1
have 1
our 1
own 1
process 1
We 1
compress 1
the 1
earth 1
into 1
bricks 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
remove 1
them 1
without 1
revealing 1
what 1
they 1
are 1
But 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
mere 1
detail 1
I 1
have 1
taken 1
you 1
fully 1
into 1
my 1
confidence 1
now 1
Mr 1
Hatherley 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
shown 1
you 1
how 1
I 1
trust 1
you 1
He 1
rose 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
I 1
shall 1
expect 1
you 1
then 1
at 1
Eyford 1
at 1
I 1
shall 1
certainly 1
be 1
there 1
And 1
not 1
a 1
word 1
to 1
a 1
soul 1
He 1
looked 1
at 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
last 1
long 1
questioning 1
gaze 1
and 1
then 1
pressing 1
my 1
hand 1
in 1
a 1
cold 1
dank 1
grasp 1
he 1
hurried 1
from 1
the 1
room 1
Well 1
when 1
I 1
came 1
to 1
think 1
it 1
all 1
over 1
in 1
cool 1
blood 1
I 1
was 1
very 1
much 1
astonished 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
both 1
think 1
at 1
this 1
sudden 1
commission 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
intrusted 1
to 1
me 1
On 1
the 1
one 1
hand 1
of 1
course 1
I 1
was 1
glad 1
for 1
the 1
fee 1
was 1
at 1
least 1
tenfold 1
what 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
asked 1
had 1
I 1
set 1
a 1
price 1
upon 1
my 1
own 1
services 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
possible 1
that 1
this 1
order 1
might 1
lead 1
to 1
other 1
ones 1
On 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
the 1
face 1
and 1
manner 1
of 1
my 1
patron 1
had 1
made 1
an 1
unpleasant 1
impression 1
upon 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
his 1
explanation 1
of 1
the 1
fuller 1
s 1
earth 1
was 1
sufficient 1
to 1
explain 1
the 1
necessity 1
for 1
my 1
coming 1
at 1
midnight 1
and 1
his 1
extreme 1
anxiety 1
lest 1
I 1
should 1
tell 1
anyone 1
of 1
my 1
errand 1
However 1
I 1
threw 1
all 1
fears 1
to 1
the 1
winds 1
ate 1
a 1
hearty 1
supper 1
drove 1
to 1
Paddington 1
and 1
started 1
off 1
having 1
obeyed 1
to 1
the 1
letter 1
the 1
injunction 1
as 1
to 1
holding 1
my 1
tongue 1
At 1
Reading 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
change 1
not 1
only 1
my 1
carriage 1
but 1
my 1
station 1
However 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
time 1
for 1
the 1
last 1
train 1
to 1
Eyford 1
and 1
I 1
reached 1
the 1
little 1
dim 1
lit 1
station 1
after 1
eleven 1
o 1
clock 1
I 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
passenger 1
who 1
got 1
out 1
there 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
one 1
upon 1
the 1
platform 1
save 1
a 1
single 1
sleepy 1
porter 1
with 1
a 1
lantern 1
As 1
I 1
passed 1
out 1
through 1
the 1
wicket 1
gate 1
however 1
I 1
found 1
my 1
acquaintance 1
of 1
the 1
morning 1
waiting 1
in 1
the 1
shadow 1
upon 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
Without 1
a 1
word 1
he 1
grasped 1
my 1
arm 1
and 1
hurried 1
me 1
into 1
a 1
carriage 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
which 1
was 1
standing 1
open 1
He 1
drew 1
up 1
the 1
windows 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
tapped 1
on 1
the 1
wood 1
work 1
and 1
away 1
we 1
went 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
the 1
horse 1
could 1
go 1
One 1
horse 1
interjected 1
Holmes 1
Yes 1
only 1
one 1
Did 1
you 1
observe 1
the 1
colour 1
Yes 1
I 1
saw 1
it 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
lights 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
stepping 1
into 1
the 1
carriage 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
chestnut 1
Tired 1
looking 1
or 1
fresh 1
Oh 1
fresh 1
and 1
glossy 1
Thank 1
you 1
I 1
am 1
sorry 1
to 1
have 1
interrupted 1
you 1
Pray 1
continue 1
your 1
most 1
interesting 1
statement 1
Away 1
we 1
went 1
then 1
and 1
we 1
drove 1
for 1
at 1
least 1
an 1
hour 1
Colonel 1
Lysander 1
Stark 1
had 1
said 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
seven 1
miles 1
but 1
I 1
should 1
think 1
from 1
the 1
rate 1
that 1
we 1
seemed 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
we 1
took 1
that 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
nearer 1
twelve 1
He 1
sat 1
at 1
my 1
side 1
in 1
silence 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
aware 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
when 1
I 1
glanced 1
in 1
his 1
direction 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
looking 1
at 1
me 1
with 1
great 1
intensity 1
The 1
country 1
roads 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
not 1
very 1
good 1
in 1
that 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
for 1
we 1
lurched 1
and 1
jolted 1
terribly 1
I 1
tried 1
to 1
look 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
windows 1
to 1
see 1
something 1
of 1
where 1
we 1
were 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
made 1
of 1
frosted 1
glass 1
and 1
I 1
could 1
make 1
out 1
nothing 1
save 1
the 1
occasional 1
bright 1
blur 1
of 1
a 1
passing 1
light 1
Now 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
hazarded 1
some 1
remark 1
to 1
break 1
the 1
monotony 1
of 1
the 1
journey 1
but 1
the 1
colonel 1
answered 1
only 1
in 1
monosyllables 1
and 1
the 1
conversation 1
soon 1
flagged 1
At 1
last 1
however 1
the 1
bumping 1
of 1
the 1
road 1
was 1
exchanged 1
for 1
the 1
crisp 1
smoothness 1
of 1
a 1
gravel 1
drive 1
and 1
the 1
carriage 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
stand 1
Colonel 1
Lysander 1
Stark 1
sprang 1
out 1
and 1
as 1
I 1
followed 1
after 1
him 1
pulled 1
me 1
swiftly 1
into 1
a 1
porch 1
which 1
gaped 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
us 1
We 1
stepped 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
right 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
carriage 1
and 1
into 1
the 1
hall 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
failed 1
to 1
catch 1
the 1
most 1
fleeting 1
glance 1
of 1
the 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
The 1
instant 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
crossed 1
the 1
threshold 1
the 1
door 1
slammed 1
heavily 1
behind 1
us 1
and 1
I 1
heard 1
faintly 1
the 1
rattle 1
of 1
the 1
wheels 1
as 1
the 1
carriage 1
drove 1
away 1
It 1
was 1
pitch 1
dark 1
inside 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
the 1
colonel 1
fumbled 1
about 1
looking 1
for 1
matches 1
and 1
muttering 1
under 1
his 1
breath 1
Suddenly 1
a 1
door 1
opened 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
passage 1
and 1
a 1
long 1
golden 1
bar 1
of 1
light 1
shot 1
out 1
in 1
our 1
direction 1
It 1
grew 1
broader 1
and 1
a 1
woman 1
appeared 1
with 1
a 1
lamp 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
which 1
she 1
held 1
above 1
her 1
head 1
pushing 1
her 1
face 1
forward 1
and 1
peering 1
at 1
us 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
pretty 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
gloss 1
with 1
which 1
the 1
light 1
shone 1
upon 1
her 1
dark 1
dress 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
rich 1
material 1
She 1
spoke 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
in 1
a 1
foreign 1
tongue 1
in 1
a 1
tone 1
as 1
though 1
asking 1
a 1
question 1
and 1
when 1
my 1
companion 1
answered 1
in 1
a 1
gruff 1
monosyllable 1
she 1
gave 1
such 1
a 1
start 1
that 1
the 1
lamp 1
nearly 1
fell 1
from 1
her 1
hand 1
Colonel 1
Stark 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
whispered 1
something 1
in 1
her 1
ear 1
and 1
then 1
pushing 1
her 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
from 1
whence 1
she 1
had 1
come 1
he 1
walked 1
towards 1
me 1
again 1
with 1
the 1
lamp 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
Perhaps 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
the 1
kindness 1
to 1
wait 1
in 1
this 1
room 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
said 1
he 1
throwing 1
open 1
another 1
door 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
quiet 1
little 1
plainly 1
furnished 1
room 1
with 1
a 1
round 1
table 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
on 1
which 1
several 1
German 1
books 1
were 1
scattered 1
Colonel 1
Stark 1
laid 1
down 1
the 1
lamp 1
on 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
a 1
harmonium 1
beside 1
the 1
door 1
I 1
shall 1
not 1
keep 1
you 1
waiting 1
an 1
instant 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
vanished 1
into 1
the 1
darkness 1
I 1
glanced 1
at 1
the 1
books 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
my 1
ignorance 1
of 1
German 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
two 1
of 1
them 1
were 1
treatises 1
on 1
science 1
the 1
others 1
being 1
volumes 1
of 1
poetry 1
Then 1
I 1
walked 1
across 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
hoping 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
catch 1
some 1
glimpse 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
side 1
but 1
an 1
oak 1
shutter 1
heavily 1
barred 1
was 1
folded 1
across 1
it 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
wonderfully 1
silent 1
house 1
There 1
was 1
an 1
old 1
clock 1
ticking 1
loudly 1
somewhere 1
in 1
the 1
passage 1
but 1
otherwise 1
everything 1
was 1
deadly 1
still 1
A 1
vague 1
feeling 1
of 1
uneasiness 1
began 1
to 1
steal 1
over 1
me 1
Who 1
were 1
these 1
German 1
people 1
and 1
what 1
were 1
they 1
doing 1
living 1
in 1
this 1
strange 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
place 1
And 1
where 1
was 1
the 1
place 1
I 1
was 1
ten 1
miles 1
or 1
so 1
from 1
Eyford 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
I 1
knew 1
but 1
whether 1
north 1
south 1
east 1
or 1
west 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
For 1
that 1
matter 1
Reading 1
and 1
possibly 1
other 1
large 1
towns 1
were 1
within 1
that 1
radius 1
so 1
the 1
place 1
might 1
not 1
be 1
so 1
secluded 1
after 1
all 1
Yet 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
certain 1
from 1
the 1
absolute 1
stillness 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
I 1
paced 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
humming 1
a 1
tune 1
under 1
my 1
breath 1
to 1
keep 1
up 1
my 1
spirits 1
and 1
feeling 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
thoroughly 1
earning 1
my 1
fifty 1
guinea 1
fee 1
Suddenly 1
without 1
any 1
preliminary 1
sound 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
the 1
utter 1
stillness 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
my 1
room 1
swung 1
slowly 1
open 1
The 1
woman 1
was 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
aperture 1
the 1
darkness 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
behind 1
her 1
the 1
yellow 1
light 1
from 1
my 1
lamp 1
beating 1
upon 1
her 1
eager 1
and 1
beautiful 1
face 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
at 1
a 1
glance 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
sick 1
with 1
fear 1
and 1
the 1
sight 1
sent 1
a 1
chill 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
heart 1
She 1
held 1
up 1
one 1
shaking 1
finger 1
to 1
warn 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
silent 1
and 1
she 1
shot 1
a 1
few 1
whispered 1
words 1
of 1
broken 1
English 1
at 1
me 1
her 1
eyes 1
glancing 1
back 1
like 1
those 1
of 1
a 1
frightened 1
horse 1
into 1
the 1
gloom 1
behind 1
her 1
I 1
would 1
go 1
said 1
she 1
trying 1
hard 1
as 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
speak 1
calmly 1
I 1
would 1
go 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
stay 1
here 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
good 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
But 1
madam 1
said 1
I 2
have 1
not 1
yet 1
done 1
what 1
I 1
came 1
for 1
I 1
cannot 1
possibly 1
leave 1
until 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
the 1
machine 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
worth 1
your 1
while 1
to 1
wait 1
she 1
went 1
on 1
You 1
can 1
pass 1
through 1
the 1
door 1
no 1
one 1
hinders 1
And 1
then 1
seeing 1
that 1
I 1
smiled 1
and 1
shook 1
my 1
head 1
she 1
suddenly 1
threw 1
aside 1
her 1
constraint 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
step 1
forward 1
with 1
her 1
hands 1
wrung 1
together 1
For 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
Heaven 1
she 1
whispered 1
get 1
away 1
from 1
here 1
before 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
late 1
But 1
I 1
am 1
somewhat 1
headstrong 1
by 1
nature 1
and 1
the 1
more 1
ready 1
to 1
engage 1
in 1
an 1
affair 1
when 1
there 1
is 1
some 1
obstacle 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
my 1
fifty 1
guinea 1
fee 1
of 1
my 1
wearisome 1
journey 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
unpleasant 1
night 1
which 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
before 1
me 1
Was 1
it 1
all 1
to 1
go 1
for 1
nothing 1
Why 1
should 1
I 1
slink 1
away 1
without 1
having 1
carried 1
out 1
my 1
commission 1
and 1
without 1
the 1
payment 1
which 1
was 1
my 1
due 1
This 1
woman 1
might 1
for 1
all 1
I 1
knew 1
be 1
a 1
monomaniac 1
With 1
a 1
stout 1
bearing 1
therefore 1
though 1
her 1
manner 1
had 1
shaken 1
me 1
more 1
than 1
I 1
cared 1
to 1
confess 1
I 1
still 1
shook 1
my 1
head 1
and 1
declared 1
my 1
intention 1
of 1
remaining 1
where 1
I 1
was 1
She 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
renew 1
her 1
entreaties 1
when 1
a 1
door 1
slammed 1
overhead 1
and 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
several 1
footsteps 1
was 1
heard 1
upon 1
the 1
stairs 1
She 1
listened 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
threw 1
up 1
her 1
hands 1
with 1
a 1
despairing 1
gesture 1
and 1
vanished 1
as 1
suddenly 1
and 1
as 1
noiselessly 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
come 1
The 1
newcomers 1
were 1
Colonel 1
Lysander 1
Stark 1
and 1
a 1
short 1
thick 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
chinchilla 1
beard 1
growing 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
creases 1
of 1
his 1
double 1
chin 1
who 1
was 1
introduced 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
Mr 1
Ferguson 1
This 1
is 1
my 1
secretary 1
and 1
manager 1
said 1
the 1
colonel 1
By 1
the 1
way 1
I 1
was 1
under 1
the 1
impression 1
that 1
I 1
left 1
this 1
door 1
shut 1
just 1
now 1
I 1
fear 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
felt 1
the 1
draught 1
On 1
the 1
contrary 1
said 1
I 2
opened 1
the 1
door 1
myself 1
because 1
I 1
felt 1
the 1
room 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
little 1
close 1
He 1
shot 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
suspicious 1
looks 1
at 1
me 1
Perhaps 1
we 1
had 1
better 1
proceed 1
to 1
business 1
then 1
said 1
he 1
Mr 1
Ferguson 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
take 1
you 1
up 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
machine 1
I 1
had 1
better 1
put 1
my 1
hat 1
on 1
I 1
suppose 1
Oh 1
no 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
What 1
you 1
dig 1
fuller 1
s 1
earth 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
No 1
no 1
This 1
is 1
only 1
where 1
we 1
compress 1
it 1
But 1
never 1
mind 1
that 1
All 1
we 1
wish 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
is 1
to 1
examine 1
the 1
machine 1
and 1
to 1
let 1
us 1
know 1
what 1
is 1
wrong 1
with 1
it 1
We 1
went 1
upstairs 1
together 1
the 1
colonel 1
first 1
with 1
the 1
lamp 1
the 1
fat 1
manager 1
and 1
I 1
behind 1
him 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
labyrinth 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
house 1
with 1
corridors 1
passages 1
narrow 1
winding 1
staircases 1
and 1
little 1
low 1
doors 1
the 1
thresholds 1
of 1
which 1
were 1
hollowed 1
out 1
by 1
the 1
generations 1
who 1
had 1
crossed 1
them 1
There 1
were 1
no 1
carpets 1
and 1
no 1
signs 1
of 1
any 1
furniture 1
above 1
the 1
ground 1
floor 1
while 1
the 1
plaster 1
was 1
peeling 1
off 1
the 1
walls 1
and 1
the 1
damp 1
was 1
breaking 1
through 1
in 1
green 1
unhealthy 1
blotches 1
I 1
tried 1
to 1
put 1
on 1
as 1
unconcerned 1
an 1
air 1
as 1
possible 1
but 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
forgotten 1
the 1
warnings 1
of 1
the 1
lady 1
even 1
though 1
I 1
disregarded 1
them 1
and 1
I 1
kept 1
a 1
keen 1
eye 1
upon 1
my 1
two 1
companions 1
Ferguson 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
morose 1
and 1
silent 1
man 1
but 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
from 1
the 1
little 1
that 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
fellow 1
countryman 1
Colonel 1
Lysander 1
Stark 1
stopped 1
at 1
last 1
before 1
a 1
low 1
door 1
which 1
he 1
unlocked 1
Within 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
square 1
room 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
three 1
of 1
us 1
could 1
hardly 1
get 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
Ferguson 1
remained 1
outside 1
and 1
the 1
colonel 1
ushered 1
me 1
in 1
We 1
are 1
now 1
said 1
he 1
actually 1
within 1
the 1
hydraulic 1
press 1
and 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
particularly 1
unpleasant 1
thing 1
for 1
us 1
if 1
anyone 1
were 1
to 1
turn 1
it 1
on 1
The 1
ceiling 1
of 1
this 1
small 1
chamber 1
is 1
really 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
descending 1
piston 1
and 1
it 1
comes 1
down 1
with 1
the 1
force 1
of 1
many 1
tons 1
upon 1
this 1
metal 1
floor 1
There 1
are 1
small 1
lateral 1
columns 1
of 1
water 1
outside 1
which 1
receive 1
the 1
force 1
and 1
which 1
transmit 1
and 1
multiply 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
manner 1
which 1
is 1
familiar 1
to 1
you 1
The 1
machine 1
goes 1
readily 1
enough 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
some 1
stiffness 1
in 1
the 1
working 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
has 1
lost 1
a 1
little 1
of 1
its 1
force 1
Perhaps 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
the 1
goodness 1
to 1
look 1
it 1
over 1
and 1
to 1
show 1
us 1
how 1
we 1
can 1
set 1
it 1
right 1
I 1
took 1
the 1
lamp 1
from 1
him 1
and 1
I 1
examined 1
the 1
machine 1
very 1
thoroughly 1
It 1
was 1
indeed 1
a 1
gigantic 1
one 1
and 1
capable 1
of 1
exercising 1
enormous 1
pressure 1
When 1
I 1
passed 1
outside 1
however 1
and 1
pressed 1
down 1
the 1
levers 1
which 1
controlled 1
it 1
I 1
knew 1
at 1
once 1
by 1
the 1
whishing 1
sound 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
slight 1
leakage 1
which 1
allowed 1
a 1
regurgitation 1
of 1
water 1
through 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
side 1
cylinders 1
An 1
examination 1
showed 1
that 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
india 1
rubber 1
bands 1
which 1
was 1
round 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
a 1
driving 1
rod 1
had 1
shrunk 1
so 1
as 1
not 1
quite 1
to 1
fill 1
the 1
socket 1
along 1
which 1
it 1
worked 1
This 1
was 1
clearly 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
power 1
and 1
I 1
pointed 1
it 1
out 1
to 1
my 1
companions 1
who 1
followed 1
my 1
remarks 1
very 1
carefully 1
and 1
asked 1
several 1
practical 1
questions 1
as 1
to 1
how 1
they 1
should 1
proceed 1
to 1
set 1
it 1
right 1
When 1
I 1
had 1
made 1
it 1
clear 1
to 1
them 1
I 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
main 1
chamber 1
of 1
the 1
machine 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
good 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
to 1
satisfy 1
my 1
own 1
curiosity 1
It 1
was 1
obvious 1
at 1
a 1
glance 1
that 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
the 1
fuller 1
s 1
earth 1
was 1
the 1
merest 1
fabrication 1
for 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
absurd 1
to 1
suppose 1
that 1
so 1
powerful 1
an 1
engine 1
could 1
be 1
designed 1
for 1
so 1
inadequate 1
a 1
purpose 1
The 1
walls 1
were 1
of 1
wood 1
but 1
the 1
floor 1
consisted 1
of 1
a 1
large 1
iron 1
trough 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
came 1
to 1
examine 1
it 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
a 1
crust 1
of 1
metallic 1
deposit 1
all 1
over 1
it 1
I 1
had 1
stooped 1
and 1
was 1
scraping 1
at 1
this 1
to 1
see 1
exactly 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
when 1
I 1
heard 1
a 1
muttered 1
exclamation 1
in 1
German 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
cadaverous 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
colonel 1
looking 1
down 1
at 1
me 1
What 1
are 1
you 1
doing 1
there 1
he 1
asked 1
I 1
felt 1
angry 1
at 1
having 1
been 1
tricked 1
by 1
so 1
elaborate 1
a 1
story 1
as 1
that 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
told 1
me 1
I 1
was 1
admiring 1
your 1
fuller 1
s 1
earth 1
said 1
I 2
think 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
better 1
able 1
to 1
advise 1
you 1
as 1
to 1
your 1
machine 1
if 1
I 1
knew 1
what 1
the 1
exact 1
purpose 1
was 1
for 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
used 1
The 1
instant 1
that 1
I 1
uttered 1
the 1
words 1
I 1
regretted 1
the 1
rashness 1
of 1
my 1
speech 1
His 1
face 1
set 1
hard 1
and 1
a 1
baleful 1
light 1
sprang 1
up 1
in 1
his 1
grey 1
eyes 1
Very 1
well 1
said 1
he 1
you 1
shall 1
know 1
all 1
about 1
the 1
machine 1
He 1
took 1
a 1
step 1
backward 1
slammed 1
the 1
little 1
door 1
and 1
turned 1
the 1
key 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
I 1
rushed 1
towards 1
it 1
and 1
pulled 1
at 1
the 1
handle 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
secure 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
give 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
to 1
my 1
kicks 1
and 1
shoves 1
Hullo 1
I 1
yelled 1
Hullo 1
Colonel 1
Let 1
me 1
out 1
And 1
then 1
suddenly 1
in 1
the 1
silence 1
I 1
heard 1
a 1
sound 1
which 1
sent 1
my 1
heart 1
into 1
my 1
mouth 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
clank 1
of 1
the 1
levers 1
and 1
the 1
swish 1
of 1
the 1
leaking 1
cylinder 1
He 1
had 1
set 1
the 1
engine 1
at 1
work 1
The 1
lamp 1
still 1
stood 1
upon 1
the 1
floor 1
where 1
I 1
had 1
placed 1
it 1
when 1
examining 1
the 1
trough 1
By 1
its 1
light 1
I 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
black 1
ceiling 1
was 1
coming 1
down 1
upon 1
me 1
slowly 1
jerkily 1
but 1
as 1
none 1
knew 1
better 1
than 1
myself 1
with 1
a 1
force 1
which 1
must 1
within 1
a 1
minute 1
grind 1
me 1
to 1
a 1
shapeless 1
pulp 1
I 1
threw 1
myself 1
screaming 1
against 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
dragged 1
with 1
my 1
nails 1
at 1
the 1
lock 1
I 1
implored 1
the 1
colonel 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
out 1
but 1
the 1
remorseless 1
clanking 1
of 1
the 1
levers 1
drowned 1
my 1
cries 1
The 1
ceiling 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
foot 1
or 1
two 1
above 1
my 1
head 1
and 1
with 1
my 1
hand 1
upraised 1
I 1
could 1
feel 1
its 1
hard 1
rough 1
surface 1
Then 1
it 1
flashed 1
through 1
my 1
mind 1
that 1
the 1
pain 1
of 1
my 1
death 1
would 1
depend 1
very 1
much 1
upon 1
the 1
position 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
met 1
it 1
If 1
I 1
lay 1
on 1
my 1
face 1
the 1
weight 1
would 1
come 1
upon 1
my 1
spine 1
and 1
I 1
shuddered 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
that 1
dreadful 1
snap 1
Easier 1
the 1
other 1
way 1
perhaps 1
and 1
yet 1
had 1
I 1
the 1
nerve 1
to 1
lie 1
and 1
look 1
up 1
at 1
that 1
deadly 1
black 1
shadow 1
wavering 1
down 1
upon 1
me 1
Already 1
I 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
stand 1
erect 1
when 1
my 1
eye 1
caught 1
something 1
which 1
brought 1
a 1
gush 1
of 1
hope 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
heart 1
I 1
have 1
said 1
that 1
though 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
ceiling 1
were 1
of 1
iron 1
the 1
walls 1
were 1
of 1
wood 1
As 1
I 1
gave 1
a 1
last 1
hurried 1
glance 1
around 1
I 1
saw 1
a 1
thin 1
line 1
of 1
yellow 1
light 1
between 1
two 1
of 1
the 1
boards 1
which 1
broadened 1
and 1
broadened 1
as 1
a 1
small 1
panel 1
was 1
pushed 1
backward 1
For 1
an 1
instant 1
I 1
could 1
hardly 1
believe 1
that 1
here 1
was 1
indeed 1
a 1
door 1
which 1
led 1
away 1
from 1
death 1
The 1
next 1
instant 1
I 1
threw 1
myself 1
through 1
and 1
lay 1
half 1
fainting 1
upon 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
The 1
panel 1
had 1
closed 1
again 1
behind 1
me 1
but 1
the 1
crash 1
of 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
afterwards 1
the 1
clang 1
of 1
the 1
two 1
slabs 1
of 1
metal 1
told 1
me 1
how 1
narrow 1
had 1
been 1
my 1
escape 1
I 1
was 1
recalled 1
to 1
myself 1
by 1
a 1
frantic 1
plucking 1
at 1
my 1
wrist 1
and 1
I 1
found 1
myself 1
lying 1
upon 1
the 1
stone 1
floor 1
of 1
a 1
narrow 1
corridor 1
while 1
a 1
woman 1
bent 1
over 1
me 1
and 1
tugged 1
at 1
me 1
with 1
her 1
left 1
hand 1
while 1
she 1
held 1
a 1
candle 1
in 1
her 1
right 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
good 1
friend 1
whose 1
warning 1
I 1
had 1
so 1
foolishly 1
rejected 1
Come 1
come 1
she 1
cried 1
breathlessly 1
They 1
will 1
be 1
here 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
They 1
will 1
see 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
there 1
Oh 1
do 1
not 1
waste 1
the 1
so 1
precious 1
time 1
but 1
come 1
This 1
time 1
at 1
least 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
scorn 1
her 1
advice 1
I 1
staggered 1
to 1
my 1
feet 1
and 1
ran 1
with 1
her 1
along 1
the 1
corridor 1
and 1
down 1
a 1
winding 1
stair 1
The 1
latter 1
led 1
to 1
another 1
broad 1
passage 1
and 1
just 1
as 1
we 1
reached 1
it 1
we 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
running 1
feet 1
and 1
the 1
shouting 1
of 1
two 1
voices 1
one 1
answering 1
the 1
other 1
from 1
the 1
floor 1
on 1
which 1
we 1
were 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
one 1
beneath 1
My 1
guide 1
stopped 1
and 1
looked 1
about 1
her 1
like 1
one 1
who 1
is 1
at 1
her 1
wit 1
s 1
end 1
Then 1
she 1
threw 1
open 1
a 1
door 1
which 1
led 1
into 1
a 1
bedroom 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
of 1
which 1
the 1
moon 1
was 1
shining 1
brightly 1
It 1
is 1
your 1
only 1
chance 1
said 1
she 1
It 1
is 1
high 1
but 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
that 1
you 1
can 1
jump 1
it 1
As 1
she 1
spoke 1
a 1
light 1
sprang 1
into 1
view 1
at 1
the 1
further 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
passage 1
and 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
lean 1
figure 1
of 1
Colonel 1
Lysander 1
Stark 1
rushing 1
forward 1
with 1
a 1
lantern 1
in 1
one 1
hand 1
and 1
a 1
weapon 1
like 1
a 1
butcher 1
s 1
cleaver 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
I 1
rushed 1
across 1
the 1
bedroom 1
flung 1
open 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
looked 1
out 1
How 1
quiet 1
and 1
sweet 1
and 1
wholesome 1
the 1
garden 1
looked 1
in 1
the 1
moonlight 1
and 1
it 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
more 1
than 1
thirty 1
feet 1
down 1
I 1
clambered 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
sill 1
but 1
I 1
hesitated 1
to 1
jump 1
until 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
heard 1
what 1
passed 1
between 1
my 1
saviour 1
and 1
the 1
ruffian 1
who 1
pursued 1
me 1
If 1
she 1
were 1
ill 1
used 1
then 1
at 1
any 1
risks 1
I 1
was 1
determined 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
her 1
assistance 1
The 1
thought 1
had 1
hardly 1
flashed 1
through 1
my 1
mind 1
before 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
pushing 1
his 1
way 1
past 1
her 1
but 1
she 1
threw 1
her 1
arms 1
round 1
him 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
hold 1
him 1
back 1
Fritz 2
she 1
cried 1
in 1
English 1
remember 1
your 1
promise 1
after 1
the 1
last 1
time 1
You 1
said 1
it 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
again 1
He 1
will 1
be 1
silent 1
Oh 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
silent 1
You 1
are 1
mad 1
Elise 1
he 1
shouted 1
struggling 1
to 1
break 1
away 1
from 1
her 1
You 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
ruin 1
of 1
us 1
He 1
has 1
seen 1
too 1
much 1
Let 1
me 1
pass 1
I 1
say 1
He 1
dashed 1
her 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
rushing 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
cut 1
at 1
me 1
with 1
his 1
heavy 1
weapon 1
I 1
had 1
let 1
myself 1
go 1
and 1
was 1
hanging 1
by 1
the 1
hands 1
to 1
the 1
sill 1
when 1
his 1
blow 1
fell 1
I 1
was 1
conscious 1
of 1
a 1
dull 1
pain 1
my 1
grip 1
loosened 1
and 1
I 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
below 1
I 1
was 1
shaken 1
but 1
not 1
hurt 1
by 1
the 1
fall 1
so 1
I 1
picked 1
myself 1
up 1
and 1
rushed 1
off 1
among 1
the 1
bushes 1
as 1
hard 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
run 1
for 1
I 1
understood 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
far 1
from 1
being 1
out 1
of 1
danger 1
yet 1
Suddenly 1
however 1
as 1
I 1
ran 1
a 1
deadly 1
dizziness 1
and 1
sickness 1
came 1
over 1
me 1
I 1
glanced 1
down 1
at 1
my 1
hand 1
which 1
was 1
throbbing 1
painfully 1
and 1
then 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
saw 1
that 1
my 1
thumb 1
had 1
been 1
cut 1
off 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
blood 1
was 1
pouring 1
from 1
my 1
wound 1
I 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
tie 1
my 1
handkerchief 1
round 1
it 1
but 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
sudden 1
buzzing 1
in 1
my 1
ears 1
and 1
next 1
moment 1
I 1
fell 1
in 1
a 1
dead 1
faint 1
among 1
the 1
rose 1
bushes 1
How 1
long 1
I 1
remained 1
unconscious 1
I 1
cannot 1
tell 1
It 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
very 1
long 1
time 1
for 1
the 1
moon 1
had 1
sunk 1
and 1
a 1
bright 1
morning 1
was 1
breaking 1
when 1
I 1
came 1
to 1
myself 1
My 1
clothes 1
were 1
all 1
sodden 1
with 1
dew 1
and 1
my 1
coat 1
sleeve 1
was 1
drenched 1
with 1
blood 1
from 1
my 1
wounded 1
thumb 1
The 1
smarting 1
of 1
it 1
recalled 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
all 1
the 1
particulars 1
of 1
my 1
night 1
s 1
adventure 1
and 1
I 1
sprang 1
to 1
my 1
feet 1
with 1
the 1
feeling 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
hardly 1
yet 1
be 1
safe 1
from 1
my 1
pursuers 1
But 1
to 1
my 1
astonishment 1
when 1
I 1
came 1
to 1
look 1
round 1
me 1
neither 1
house 1
nor 1
garden 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
lying 1
in 1
an 1
angle 1
of 1
the 1
hedge 1
close 1
by 1
the 1
highroad 1
and 1
just 1
a 1
little 1
lower 1
down 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
building 1
which 1
proved 1
upon 1
my 1
approaching 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
very 1
station 1
at 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
arrived 1
upon 1
the 1
previous 1
night 1
Were 1
it 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
ugly 1
wound 1
upon 1
my 1
hand 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
passed 1
during 1
those 1
dreadful 1
hours 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
an 1
evil 1
dream 1
Half 1
dazed 1
I 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
station 1
and 1
asked 1
about 1
the 1
morning 1
train 1
There 1
would 1
be 1
one 1
to 1
Reading 1
in 1
less 1
than 1
an 1
hour 1
The 1
same 1
porter 1
was 1
on 1
duty 1
I 1
found 1
as 1
had 1
been 1
there 1
when 1
I 1
arrived 1
I 1
inquired 1
of 1
him 1
whether 1
he 1
had 1
ever 1
heard 1
of 1
Colonel 1
Lysander 1
Stark 1
The 1
name 1
was 1
strange 1
to 1
him 1
Had 1
he 1
observed 1
a 1
carriage 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
waiting 1
for 1
me 1
No 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
Was 1
there 1
a 1
police 1
station 1
anywhere 1
near 1
There 1
was 1
one 1
about 1
three 1
miles 1
off 1
It 1
was 1
too 1
far 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
go 1
weak 1
and 1
ill 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
I 1
determined 1
to 1
wait 1
until 1
I 1
got 1
back 1
to 1
town 1
before 1
telling 1
my 1
story 1
to 1
the 1
police 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
past 1
six 1
when 1
I 1
arrived 1
so 1
I 1
went 1
first 1
to 1
have 1
my 1
wound 1
dressed 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
doctor 1
was 1
kind 1
enough 1
to 1
bring 1
me 1
along 1
here 1
I 1
put 1
the 1
case 1
into 1
your 1
hands 1
and 1
shall 1
do 1
exactly 1
what 1
you 1
advise 1
We 1
both 1
sat 1
in 1
silence 1
for 1
some 1
little 1
time 1
after 1
listening 1
to 1
this 1
extraordinary 1
narrative 1
Then 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
pulled 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
shelf 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
ponderous 1
commonplace 1
books 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
placed 1
his 1
cuttings 1
Here 1
is 1
an 1
advertisement 1
which 1
will 1
interest 1
you 1
said 1
he 1
It 1
appeared 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
papers 1
about 1
a 1
year 1
ago 1
Listen 1
to 1
this 1
Lost 1

Mr 1
Jeremiah 1
Hayling 1
aged 1

his 1

represents 1
the 1
last 1
time 1
that 1
the 1
colonel 1
needed 1
to 1
have 1
his 1
machine 1
overhauled 1
I 1
fancy 1
Good 1
heavens 1
cried 1
my 1
patient 1
Then 1
that 1
explains 1
what 1
the 1
girl 1
said 1
Undoubtedly 1
It 1
is 1
quite 1
clear 1
that 1
the 1
colonel 1
was 1
a 1
cool 1
and 1
desperate 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
absolutely 1
determined 1
that 1
nothing 1
should 1
stand 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
his 1
little 1
game 1
like 1
those 1
out 1
and 1
out 1
pirates 1
who 1
will 1
leave 1
no 1
survivor 1
from 1
a 1
captured 1
ship 1
Well 1
every 1
moment 1
now 1
is 1
precious 1
so 1
if 1
you 1
feel 1
equal 1
to 1
it 1
we 1
shall 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
Scotland 1
Yard 1
at 1
once 1
as 1
a 1
preliminary 1
to 1
starting 1
for 1
Eyford 1
Some 1
three 1
hours 1
or 1
so 1
afterwards 1
we 1
were 1
all 1
in 1
the 1
train 1
together 1
bound 1
from 1
Reading 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
Berkshire 1
village 1
There 1
were 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
the 1
hydraulic 1
engineer 1
Inspector 1
Bradstreet 1
of 1
Scotland 1
Yard 1
a 1
plain 1
clothes 1
man 1
and 1
myself 1
Bradstreet 1
had 1
spread 1
an 1
ordnance 1
map 1
of 1
the 1
county 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
seat 1
and 1
was 1
busy 1
with 1
his 1
compasses 1
drawing 1
a 1
circle 1
with 1
Eyford 1
for 1
its 1
centre 1
There 1
you 1
are 1
said 1
he 1
That 1
circle 1
is 1
drawn 1
at 1
a 1
radius 1
of 1
ten 1
miles 1
from 1
the 1
village 1
The 1
place 1
we 1
want 1
must 1
be 1
somewhere 1
near 1
that 1
line 1
You 1
said 1
ten 1
miles 1
I 1
think 1
sir 1
It 1
was 1
an 1
hour 1
s 1
good 1
drive 1
And 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
they 1
brought 1
you 1
back 1
all 1
that 1
way 1
when 1
you 1
were 1
unconscious 1
They 1
must 1
have 1
done 1
so 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
confused 1
memory 1
too 1
of 1
having 1
been 1
lifted 1
and 1
conveyed 1
somewhere 1
What 1
I 1
cannot 1
understand 1
said 1
I 1
is 1
why 1
they 1
should 1
have 1
spared 1
you 1
when 1
they 1
found 1
you 1
lying 1
fainting 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
Perhaps 1
the 1
villain 1
was 1
softened 1
by 1
the 1
woman 1
s 1
entreaties 1
I 1
hardly 1
think 1
that 1
likely 1
I 1
never 1
saw 1
a 1
more 1
inexorable 1
face 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
Oh 1
we 1
shall 1
soon 1
clear 1
up 1
all 1
that 1
said 1
Bradstreet 1
Well 1
I 1
have 1
drawn 1
my 1
circle 1
and 1
I 1
only 1
wish 1
I 1
knew 1
at 1
what 1
point 1
upon 1
it 1
the 1
folk 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
are 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
I 1
think 1
I 1
could 1
lay 1
my 1
finger 1
on 1
it 1
said 1
Holmes 1
quietly 1
Really 1
now 1
cried 1
the 1
inspector 1
you 1
have 1
formed 1
your 1
opinion 1
Come 1
now 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
who 1
agrees 1
with 1
you 1
I 1
say 1
it 1
is 1
south 1
for 1
the 1
country 1
is 1
more 1
deserted 1
there 1
And 1
I 1
say 1
east 1
said 1
my 1
patient 1
I 1
am 1
for 1
west 1
remarked 1
the 1
plain 1
clothes 1
man 1
There 1
are 1
several 1
quiet 1
little 1
villages 1
up 1
there 1
And 1
I 1
am 1
for 1
north 1
said 1
I 1
because 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
hills 1
there 1
and 1
our 1
friend 1
says 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
notice 1
the 1
carriage 1
go 1
up 1
any 1
Come 1
cried 1
the 1
inspector 1
laughing 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
very 1
pretty 1
diversity 1
of 1
opinion 1
We 1
have 1
boxed 1
the 1
compass 1
among 1
us 1
Who 1
do 1
you 1
give 1
your 1
casting 1
vote 1
to 1
You 1
are 1
all 1
wrong 1
But 1
we 1
can 1
t 1
all 1
be 1
Oh 1
yes 1
you 1
can 1
This 1
is 1
my 1
point 1
He 1
placed 1
his 1
finger 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
circle 1
This 1
is 1
where 1
we 1
shall 1
find 1
them 1
But 1
the 1
twelve 1
mile 1
drive 1
gasped 1
Hatherley 1
Six 1
out 1
and 1
six 1
back 1
Nothing 1
simpler 1
You 1
say 1
yourself 1
that 1
the 1
horse 1
was 1
fresh 1
and 1
glossy 1
when 1
you 1
got 1
in 1
How 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
that 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
gone 1
twelve 1
miles 1
over 1
heavy 1
roads 1
Indeed 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
likely 1
ruse 1
enough 1
observed 1
Bradstreet 1
thoughtfully 1
Of 1
course 1
there 1
can 1
be 1
no 1
doubt 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
this 1
gang 1
None 1
at 1
all 1
said 1
Holmes 1
They 1
are 1
coiners 1
on 1
a 1
large 1
scale 1
and 1
have 1
used 1
the 1
machine 1
to 1
form 1
the 1
amalgam 1
which 1
has 1
taken 1
the 1
place 1
of 1
silver 1
We 1
have 1
known 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
that 1
a 1
clever 1
gang 1
was 1
at 1
work 1
said 1
the 1
inspector 1
They 1
have 1
been 1
turning 1
out 1
half 1
crowns 1
by 1
the 1
thousand 1
We 1
even 1
traced 1
them 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
Reading 1
but 1
could 1
get 1
no 1
farther 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
covered 1
their 1
traces 1
in 1
a 1
way 1
that 1
showed 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
very 1
old 1
hands 1
But 1
now 1
thanks 1
to 1
this 1
lucky 1
chance 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
got 1
them 1
right 1
enough 1
But 1
the 1
inspector 1
was 1
mistaken 1
for 1
those 1
criminals 1
were 1
not 1
destined 1
to 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
justice 1
As 1
we 1
rolled 1
into 1
Eyford 1
Station 1
we 1
saw 1
a 1
gigantic 1
column 1
of 1
smoke 1
which 1
streamed 1
up 1
from 1
behind 1
a 1
small 1
clump 1
of 1
trees 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
and 1
hung 1
like 1
an 1
immense 1
ostrich 1
feather 1
over 1
the 1
landscape 1
A 1
house 1
on 1
fire 1
asked 1
Bradstreet 1
as 1
the 1
train 1
steamed 1
off 1
again 1
on 1
its 1
way 1
Yes 1
sir 1
said 1
the 1
station 1
master 1
When 1
did 1
it 1
break 1
out 1
I 1
hear 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
during 1
the 1
night 1
sir 1
but 1
it 1
has 1
got 1
worse 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
place 1
is 1
in 1
a 1
blaze 1
Whose 1
house 1
is 1
it 1
Dr 1
Becher 1
s 1
Tell 1
me 1
broke 1
in 1
the 1
engineer 1
is 1
Dr 1
Becher 1
a 1
German 1
very 1
thin 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
sharp 1
nose 1
The 1
station 1
master 1
laughed 1
heartily 1
No 1
sir 1
Dr 1
Becher 1
is 1
an 1
Englishman 1
and 1
there 1
isn 1
t 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
parish 1
who 1
has 1
a 1
better 1
lined 1
waistcoat 1
But 1
he 1
has 1
a 1
gentleman 1
staying 1
with 1
him 1
a 1
patient 1
as 1
I 1
understand 1
who 1
is 1
a 1
foreigner 1
and 1
he 1
looks 1
as 1
if 1
a 1
little 1
good 1
Berkshire 1
beef 1
would 1
do 1
him 1
no 1
harm 1
The 1
station 1
master 1
had 1
not 1
finished 1
his 1
speech 1
before 1
we 1
were 1
all 1
hastening 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
The 1
road 1
topped 1
a 1
low 1
hill 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
widespread 1
whitewashed 1
building 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
us 1
spouting 1
fire 1
at 1
every 1
chink 1
and 1
window 1
while 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
in 1
front 1
three 1
fire 1
engines 1
were 1
vainly 1
striving 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
flames 1
under 1
That 1
s 1
it 1
cried 1
Hatherley 1
in 1
intense 1
excitement 1
There 1
is 1
the 1
gravel 1
drive 1
and 1
there 1
are 1
the 1
rose 1
bushes 1
where 1
I 1
lay 1
That 1
second 1
window 1
is 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
I 1
jumped 1
from 1
Well 1
at 1
least 1
said 1
Holmes 1
you 1
have 1
had 1
your 1
revenge 1
upon 1
them 1
There 1
can 1
be 1
no 1
question 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
your 1
oil 1
lamp 1
which 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
crushed 1
in 1
the 1
press 1
set 1
fire 1
to 1
the 1
wooden 1
walls 1
though 1
no 1
doubt 1
they 1
were 1
too 1
excited 1
in 1
the 1
chase 1
after 1
you 1
to 1
observe 1
it 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
Now 1
keep 1
your 1
eyes 1
open 1
in 1
this 1
crowd 1
for 1
your 1
friends 1
of 1
last 1
night 1
though 1
I 1
very 1
much 1
fear 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
a 1
good 1
hundred 1
miles 1
off 1
by 1
now 1
And 1
Holmes 1
fears 1
came 1
to 1
be 1
realised 1
for 1
from 1
that 1
day 1
to 1
this 1
no 1
word 1
has 1
ever 1
been 1
heard 1
either 1
of 1
the 1
beautiful 1
woman 1
the 1
sinister 1
German 1
or 1
the 1
morose 1
Englishman 1
Early 1
that 1
morning 1
a 1
peasant 1
had 1
met 1
a 1
cart 1
containing 1
several 1
people 1
and 1
some 1
very 1
bulky 1
boxes 1
driving 1
rapidly 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
Reading 1
but 1
there 1
all 1
traces 1
of 1
the 1
fugitives 1
disappeared 1
and 1
even 1
Holmes 1
ingenuity 1
failed 1
ever 1
to 1
discover 1
the 1
least 1
clue 1
as 1
to 1
their 1
whereabouts 1
The 1
firemen 1
had 1
been 1
much 1
perturbed 1
at 1
the 1
strange 1
arrangements 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
found 1
within 1
and 1
still 1
more 1
so 1
by 1
discovering 1
a 1
newly 1
severed 1
human 1
thumb 1
upon 1
a 1
window 1
sill 1
of 1
the 1
second 1
floor 1
About 1
sunset 1
however 1
their 1
efforts 1
were 1
at 1
last 1
successful 1
and 1
they 1
subdued 1
the 1
flames 1
but 1
not 1
before 1
the 1
roof 1
had 1
fallen 1
in 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
place 1
been 1
reduced 1
to 1
such 1
absolute 1
ruin 1
that 1
save 1
some 1
twisted 1
cylinders 1
and 1
iron 1
piping 1
not 1
a 1
trace 1
remained 1
of 1
the 1
machinery 1
which 1
had 1
cost 1
our 1
unfortunate 1
acquaintance 1
so 1
dearly 1
Large 1
masses 1
of 1
nickel 1
and 1
of 1
tin 1
were 1
discovered 1
stored 1
in 1
an 1
out 1
house 1
but 1
no 1
coins 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
which 1
may 1
have 1
explained 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
those 1
bulky 1
boxes 1
which 1
have 1
been 1
already 1
referred 1
to 1
How 1
our 1
hydraulic 1
engineer 1
had 1
been 1
conveyed 1
from 1
the 1
garden 1
to 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
he 1
recovered 1
his 1
senses 1
might 1
have 1
remained 1
forever 1
a 1
mystery 1
were 1
it 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
soft 1
mould 1
which 1
told 1
us 1
a 1
very 1
plain 1
tale 1
He 1
had 1
evidently 1
been 1
carried 1
down 1
by 1
two 1
persons 1
one 1
of 1
whom 1
had 1
remarkably 1
small 1
feet 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
unusually 1
large 1
ones 1
On 1
the 1
whole 1
it 1
was 1
most 1
probable 1
that 1
the 1
silent 1
Englishman 1
being 1
less 1
bold 1
or 1
less 1
murderous 1
than 1
his 1
companion 1
had 1
assisted 1
the 1
woman 1
to 1
bear 1
the 1
unconscious 1
man 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
danger 1
Well 1
said 1
our 1
engineer 1
ruefully 1
as 1
we 1
took 1
our 1
seats 1
to 1
return 1
once 1
more 1
to 1
London 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
pretty 1
business 1
for 1
me 1
I 1
have 1
lost 1
my 1
thumb 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
lost 1
a 1
fifty 1
guinea 1
fee 1
and 1
what 1
have 1
I 1
gained 1
Experience 1
said 1
Holmes 1
laughing 1
Indirectly 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
of 1
value 1
you 1
know 1
you 1
have 1
only 1
to 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
words 1
to 1
gain 1
the 1
reputation 1
of 1
being 1
excellent 1
company 1
for 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
your 1
existence 1
X 1
THE 1
ADVENTURE 1
OF 1
THE 1
NOBLE 1
BACHELOR 1
The 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
marriage 1
and 1
its 1
curious 1
termination 1
have 1
long 1
ceased 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
subject 1
of 1
interest 1
in 1
those 1
exalted 1
circles 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
unfortunate 1
bridegroom 1
moves 1
Fresh 1
scandals 1
have 1
eclipsed 1
it 1
and 1
their 1
more 1
piquant 1
details 1
have 1
drawn 1
the 1
gossips 1
away 1
from 1
this 1
four 1
year 1
old 1
drama 1
As 1
I 1
have 1
reason 1
to 1
believe 1
however 1
that 1
the 1
full 1
facts 1
have 1
never 1
been 1
revealed 1
to 1
the 1
general 1
public 1
and 1
as 1
my 1
friend 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
had 1
a 1
considerable 1
share 1
in 1
clearing 1
the 1
matter 1
up 1
I 1
feel 1
that 1
no 1
memoir 1
of 1
him 1
would 1
be 1
complete 1
without 1
some 1
little 1
sketch 1
of 1
this 1
remarkable 1
episode 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
few 1
weeks 1
before 1
my 1
own 1
marriage 1
during 1
the 1
days 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
still 1
sharing 1
rooms 1
with 1
Holmes 1
in 1
Baker 1
Street 1
that 1
he 1
came 1
home 1
from 1
an 1
afternoon 1
stroll 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
letter 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
waiting 1
for 1
him 1
I 1
had 1
remained 1
indoors 1
all 1
day 1
for 1
the 1
weather 1
had 1
taken 1
a 1
sudden 1
turn 1
to 1
rain 1
with 1
high 1
autumnal 1
winds 1
and 1
the 1
Jezail 1
bullet 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
brought 1
back 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
limbs 1
as 1
a 1
relic 1
of 1
my 1
Afghan 1
campaign 1
throbbed 1
with 1
dull 1
persistence 1
With 1
my 1
body 1
in 1
one 1
easy 1
chair 1
and 1
my 1
legs 1
upon 1
another 1
I 1
had 1
surrounded 1
myself 1
with 1
a 1
cloud 1
of 1
newspapers 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
saturated 1
with 1
the 1
news 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
I 1
tossed 1
them 1
all 1
aside 1
and 1
lay 1
listless 1
watching 1
the 1
huge 1
crest 1
and 1
monogram 1
upon 1
the 1
envelope 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
wondering 1
lazily 1
who 1
my 1
friend 1
s 1
noble 1
correspondent 1
could 1
be 1
Here 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
fashionable 1
epistle 1
I 1
remarked 1
as 1
he 1
entered 1
Your 1
morning 1
letters 1
if 1
I 1
remember 1
right 1
were 1
from 1
a 1
fish 1
monger 1
and 1
a 1
tide 1
waiter 1
Yes 1
my 1
correspondence 1
has 1
certainly 1
the 1
charm 1
of 1
variety 1
he 1
answered 1
smiling 1
and 1
the 1
humbler 1
are 1
usually 1
the 1
more 1
interesting 1
This 1
looks 1
like 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
unwelcome 1
social 1
summonses 1
which 1
call 1
upon 1
a 1
man 1
either 1
to 1
be 1
bored 1
or 1
to 1
lie 1
He 1
broke 1
the 1
seal 1
and 1
glanced 1
over 1
the 1
contents 1
Oh 1
come 1
it 1
may 1
prove 1
to 1
be 1
something 1
of 1
interest 1
after 1
all 1
Not 1
social 1
then 1
No 1
distinctly 1
professional 1
And 1
from 1
a 1
noble 1
client 1
One 1
of 1
the 1
highest 1
in 1
England 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
I 1
congratulate 1
you 1
I 1
assure 1
you 1
Watson 1
without 1
affectation 1
that 1
the 1
status 1
of 1
my 1
client 1
is 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
less 1
moment 1
to 1
me 1
than 1
the 1
interest 1
of 1
his 1
case 1
It 1
is 1
just 1
possible 1
however 1
that 2
also 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
wanting 1
in 1
this 1
new 1
investigation 1
You 1
have 1
been 1
reading 1
the 1
papers 1
diligently 1
of 1
late 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
It 1
looks 1
like 1
it 1
said 1
I 1
ruefully 1
pointing 1
to 1
a 1
huge 1
bundle 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
I 1
have 1
had 1
nothing 1
else 1
to 1
do 1
It 1
is 1
fortunate 1
for 1
you 1
will 1
perhaps 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
post 1
me 1
up 1
I 1
read 1
nothing 1
except 1
the 1
criminal 1
news 1
and 1
the 1
agony 1
column 1
The 1
latter 1
is 1
always 1
instructive 1
But 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
followed 1
recent 1
events 1
so 1
closely 1
you 1
must 1
have 1
read 1
about 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
and 1
his 1
wedding 1
Oh 1
yes 1
with 1
the 1
deepest 1
interest 1
That 1
is 1
well 1
The 1
letter 1
which 1
I 1
hold 1
in 1
my 1
hand 1
is 1
from 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
I 1
will 1
read 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
and 1
in 1
return 1
you 1
must 1
turn 1
over 1
these 1
papers 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
whatever 1
bears 1
upon 1
the 1
matter 1
This 1
is 1
what 1
he 1
says 1
MY 1
DEAR 1
MR 1
SHERLOCK 1
HOLMES 1
Lord 1
Backwater 1
tells 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
place 1
implicit 1
reliance 1
upon 1
your 1
judgment 1
and 1
discretion 1
I 1
have 1
determined 1
therefore 1
to 1
call 1
upon 1
you 1
and 1
to 1
consult 1
you 1
in 1
reference 1
to 1
the 1
very 1
painful 1
event 1
which 1
has 1
occurred 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
my 1
wedding 1
Mr 1
Lestrade 1
of 1
Scotland 1
Yard 1
is 1
acting 1
already 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
but 1
he 1
assures 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
sees 1
no 1
objection 1
to 1
your 1
co 1
operation 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
even 1
thinks 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
of 1
some 1
assistance 1
I 1
will 1
call 1
at 1
four 1
o 1
clock 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
and 1
should 1
you 1
have 1
any 1
other 1
engagement 1
at 1
that 1
time 1
I 1
hope 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
postpone 1
it 1
as 1
this 1
matter 1
is 1
of 1
paramount 1
importance 1
Yours 1
faithfully 1
ST 1
SIMON 1
It 1
is 1
dated 1
from 1
Grosvenor 1
Mansions 1
written 1
with 1
a 1
quill 1
pen 1
and 1
the 1
noble 1
lord 1
has 1
had 1
the 1
misfortune 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
smear 1
of 1
ink 1
upon 1
the 1
outer 1
side 1
of 1
his 1
right 1
little 1
finger 1

Holmes 1
as 1
he 1
folded 1
up 1
the 1
epistle 1
He 1
says 1

clock 1
It 1
is 1
three 1
now 1
He 1
will 1
be 1
here 1
in 1
an 1
hour 1
Then 1
I 1
have 1
just 1
time 1
with 1
your 1
assistance 1
to 1
get 1
clear 1
upon 1
the 1
subject 1
Turn 1
over 1
those 1
papers 1
and 1
arrange 1
the 1
extracts 1
in 1
their 1
order 1
of 1

while 1
I 1
take 1
a 1
glance 1
as 1
to 1
who 1

Ha 1
Well 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
very 1
instructive 1
in 1
all 1
this 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
must 1
turn 1
to 1
you 1
Watson 1
for 1
something 1
more 1
solid 1
I 1
have 1
very 1
little 1
difficulty 1
in 1
finding 1
what 1
I 1
want 1
said 1
I 1
for 1
the 1
facts 1
are 1
quite 1
recent 1
and 1
the 1
matter 1
struck 1
me 1
as 1
remarkable 1
I 1
feared 1
to 1
refer 1
them 1
to 1
you 1
however 1
as 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
an 1
inquiry 1
on 1
hand 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
disliked 1
the 1
intrusion 1
of 1
other 1
matters 1
Oh 1
you 1
mean 1
the 1
little 1
problem 1
of 1
the 1
Grosvenor 1
Square 1
furniture 1
van 1
That 1
is 1
quite 1
cleared 1
up 1
now 1
though 1
indeed 1
it 1
was 1
obvious 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
Pray 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
results 1
of 1
your 1
newspaper 1
selections 1
Here 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
notice 1
which 1
I 1
can 1
find 1
It 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
personal 1
column 1
of 1
the 1
Morning 1
Post 1
and 1
dates 1
as 1
you 1
see 1
some 1
weeks 1
back 1
A 1
marriage 1
has 1
been 1
arranged 1
it 1
says 1
and 1
will 1
if 1
rumour 1
is 1
correct 1
very 1
shortly 1
take 1
place 1
between 1
Lord 1
Robert 1
St 1

That 1
is 1
all 1
Terse 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
point 1
remarked 1
Holmes 1
stretching 1
his 1
long 1
thin 1
legs 1
towards 1
the 1
fire 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
paragraph 1
amplifying 1
this 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
society 1
papers 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
week 1
Ah 1
here 1
it 1
is 1
There 1
will 1
soon 1
be 1
a 1
call 1
for 1
protection 1
in 1
the 1
marriage 1
market 1
for 1
the 1
present 1
free 1
trade 1
principle 1
appears 1
to 1
tell 1
heavily 1
against 1
our 1
home 1
product 1
One 1
by 1
one 1
the 1
management 1
of 1
the 1
noble 1
houses 1
of 1
Great 1
Britain 1
is 1
passing 1
into 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
our 1
fair 1
cousins 1
from 1
across 1
the 1
Atlantic 1
An 1
important 1
addition 1
has 1
been 1
made 1
during 1
the 1
last 1
week 1
to 1
the 1
list 1
of 1
the 1
prizes 1
which 1
have 1
been 1
borne 1
away 1
by 1
these 1
charming 1
invaders 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
who 1
has 1
shown 1
himself 1
for 1
over 1
twenty 1
years 1
proof 1
against 1
the 1
little 1
god 1
s 1
arrows 1
has 1
now 1
definitely 1
announced 1
his 1
approaching 1
marriage 1
with 1
Miss 1
Hatty 1
Doran 1
the 1
fascinating 1
daughter 1
of 1
a 1
California 1
millionaire 1
Miss 1
Doran 1
whose 1
graceful 1
figure 1
and 1
striking 1
face 1
attracted 1
much 1
attention 1
at 1
the 1
Westbury 1
House 1
festivities 1
is 1
an 1
only 1
child 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
currently 1
reported 1
that 1
her 1
dowry 1
will 1
run 1
to 1
considerably 1
over 1
the 1
six 1
figures 1
with 1
expectancies 1
for 1
the 1
future 1
As 1
it 1
is 1
an 1
open 1
secret 1
that 1
the 1
Duke 1
of 1
Balmoral 1
has 1
been 1
compelled 1
to 1
sell 1
his 1
pictures 1
within 1
the 1
last 1
few 1
years 1
and 1
as 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
has 1
no 1
property 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
save 1
the 1
small 1
estate 1
of 1
Birchmoor 1
it 1
is 1
obvious 1
that 1
the 1
Californian 1
heiress 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
only 1
gainer 1
by 1
an 1
alliance 1
which 1
will 1
enable 1
her 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
easy 1
and 1
common 1
transition 1
from 1
a 1
Republican 1
lady 1
to 1
a 1
British 1
peeress 1
Anything 1
else 1
asked 1
Holmes 1
yawning 1
Oh 1
yes 1
plenty 1
Then 1
there 1
is 1
another 1
note 1
in 1
the 1
Morning 1
Post 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
the 1
marriage 1
would 1
be 1
an 1
absolutely 1
quiet 1
one 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
at 1
St 1
George 1
s 1
Hanover 1
Square 1
that 1
only 1
half 1
a 1
dozen 1
intimate 1
friends 1
would 1
be 1
invited 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
party 1
would 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
furnished 1
house 1
at 1
Lancaster 1
Gate 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
taken 1
by 1
Mr 1
Aloysius 1
Doran 1
Two 1
days 1
later 1
that 1
is 1
on 1
Wednesday 1
last 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
curt 1
announcement 1
that 1
the 1
wedding 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
honeymoon 1
would 1
be 1
passed 1
at 1
Lord 1
Backwater 1
s 1
place 1
near 1
Petersfield 1
Those 1
are 1
all 1
the 1
notices 1
which 1
appeared 1
before 1
the 1
disappearance 1
of 1
the 1
bride 1
Before 1
the 1
what 1
asked 1
Holmes 1
with 1
a 1
start 1
The 1
vanishing 1
of 1
the 1
lady 1
When 1
did 1
she 1
vanish 1
then 1
At 1
the 1
wedding 1
breakfast 1
Indeed 1
This 1
is 1
more 1
interesting 1
than 1
it 1
promised 1
to 1
be 1
quite 1
dramatic 1
in 1
fact 1
Yes 1
it 1
struck 1
me 1
as 1
being 1
a 1
little 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
common 1
They 1
often 1
vanish 1
before 1
the 1
ceremony 1
and 1
occasionally 1
during 1
the 1
honeymoon 1
but 1
I 1
cannot 1
call 1
to 1
mind 1
anything 1
quite 1
so 1
prompt 1
as 1
this 1
Pray 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
the 1
details 1
I 1
warn 1
you 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
very 1
incomplete 1
Perhaps 1
we 1
may 1
make 1
them 1
less 1
so 1
Such 1
as 1
they 1
are 1
they 1
are 1
set 1
forth 1
in 1
a 1
single 1
article 1
of 1
a 1
morning 1
paper 1
of 1
yesterday 1
which 1
I 1
will 1
read 1
to 1
you 1
It 1
is 1
headed 1
Singular 1
Occurrence 1
at 1
a 1
Fashionable 1
Wedding 1
The 1
family 1
of 1
Lord 1
Robert 1
St 1
Simon 1
has 1
been 1
thrown 1
into 1
the 1
greatest 1
consternation 1
by 1
the 1
strange 1
and 1
painful 1
episodes 1
which 1
have 1
taken 1
place 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
his 1
wedding 1
The 1
ceremony 1
as 1
shortly 1
announced 1
in 1
the 1
papers 1
of 1
yesterday 1
occurred 1
on 1
the 1
previous 1
morning 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
now 1
that 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
possible 1
to 1
confirm 1
the 1
strange 1
rumours 1
which 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
persistently 1
floating 1
about 1
In 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
attempts 1
of 1
the 1
friends 1
to 1
hush 1
the 1
matter 1
up 1
so 1
much 1
public 1
attention 1
has 1
now 1
been 1
drawn 1
to 1
it 1
that 1
no 1
good 1
purpose 1
can 1
be 1
served 1
by 1
affecting 1
to 1
disregard 1
what 1
is 1
a 1
common 1
subject 1
for 1
conversation 1
The 1
ceremony 1
which 1
was 1
performed 1
at 1
St 1
George 1
s 1
Hanover 1
Square 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
quiet 1
one 1
no 1
one 1
being 1
present 1
save 1
the 1
father 1
of 1
the 1
bride 1
Mr 1
Aloysius 1
Doran 1
the 1
Duchess 1
of 1
Balmoral 1
Lord 1
Backwater 1
Lord 1
Eustace 1
and 1
Lady 1
Clara 1
St 1
Simon 1
the 1
younger 1
brother 1
and 1
sister 1
of 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
and 1
Lady 1
Alicia 1
Whittington 1
The 1
whole 1
party 1
proceeded 1
afterwards 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
Mr 1
Aloysius 1
Doran 1
at 1
Lancaster 1
Gate 1
where 1
breakfast 1
had 1
been 1
prepared 1
It 1
appears 1
that 1
some 1
little 1
trouble 1
was 1
caused 1
by 1
a 1
woman 1
whose 1
name 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
ascertained 1
who 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
force 1
her 1
way 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
after 1
the 1
bridal 1
party 1
alleging 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
some 1
claim 1
upon 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
It 1
was 1
only 1
after 1
a 1
painful 1
and 1
prolonged 1
scene 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
ejected 1
by 1
the 1
butler 1
and 1
the 1
footman 1
The 1
bride 1
who 1
had 1
fortunately 1
entered 1
the 1
house 1
before 1
this 1
unpleasant 1
interruption 1
had 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
breakfast 1
with 1
the 1
rest 1
when 1
she 1
complained 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
indisposition 1
and 1
retired 1
to 1
her 1
room 1
Her 1
prolonged 1
absence 1
having 1
caused 1
some 1
comment 1
her 1
father 1
followed 1
her 1
but 1
learned 1
from 1
her 1
maid 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
only 1
come 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
chamber 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
caught 1
up 1
an 1
ulster 1
and 1
bonnet 1
and 1
hurried 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
passage 1
One 1
of 1
the 1
footmen 1
declared 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
a 1
lady 1
leave 1
the 1
house 1
thus 1
apparelled 1
but 1
had 1
refused 1
to 1
credit 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
mistress 1
believing 1
her 1
to 1
be 1
with 1
the 1
company 1
On 1
ascertaining 1
that 1
his 1
daughter 1
had 1
disappeared 1
Mr 1
Aloysius 1
Doran 1
in 1
conjunction 1
with 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
instantly 1
put 1
themselves 1
in 1
communication 1
with 1
the 1
police 1
and 1
very 1
energetic 1
inquiries 1
are 1
being 1
made 1
which 1
will 1
probably 1
result 1
in 1
a 1
speedy 1
clearing 1
up 1
of 1
this 1
very 1
singular 1
business 1
Up 1
to 1
a 1
late 1
hour 1
last 1
night 1
however 1
nothing 1
had 1
transpired 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
whereabouts 1
of 1
the 1
missing 1
lady 1
There 1
are 1
rumours 1
of 1
foul 1
play 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
said 1
that 1
the 1
police 1
have 1
caused 1
the 1
arrest 1
of 1
the 1
woman 1
who 1
had 1
caused 1
the 1
original 1
disturbance 1
in 1
the 1
belief 1
that 1
from 1
jealousy 1
or 1
some 1
other 1
motive 1
she 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
concerned 1
in 1
the 1
strange 1
disappearance 1
of 1
the 1
bride 1
And 1
is 1
that 1
all 1
Only 1
one 1
little 1
item 1
in 1
another 1
of 1
the 1
morning 1
papers 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
suggestive 1
one 1
And 1
it 1
is 1
That 1
Miss 1
Flora 1
Millar 1
the 1
lady 1
who 1
had 1
caused 1
the 1
disturbance 1
has 1
actually 1
been 1
arrested 1
It 1
appears 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
formerly 1
a 1
danseuse 1
at 1
the 1
Allegro 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
has 1
known 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
for 1
some 1
years 1
There 1
are 1
no 1
further 1
particulars 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
case 1
is 1
in 1
your 1
hands 1
now 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
set 1
forth 1
in 1
the 1
public 1
press 1
And 1
an 1
exceedingly 1
interesting 1
case 1
it 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
missed 1
it 1
for 1
worlds 1
But 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
ring 1
at 1
the 1
bell 1
Watson 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
clock 1
makes 1
it 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
after 1
four 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
this 1
will 1
prove 1
to 1
be 1
our 1
noble 1
client 1
Do 1
not 1
dream 1
of 1
going 1
Watson 1
for 1
I 1
very 1
much 1
prefer 1
having 1
a 1
witness 1
if 1
only 1
as 1
a 1
check 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
memory 1
Lord 1
Robert 1
St 1
Simon 1
announced 1
our 1
page 1
boy 1
throwing 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
A 1
gentleman 1
entered 1
with 1
a 1
pleasant 1
cultured 1
face 1
high 1
nosed 1
and 1
pale 1
with 1
something 1
perhaps 1
of 1
petulance 1
about 1
the 1
mouth 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
steady 1
well 1
opened 1
eye 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
whose 1
pleasant 1
lot 1
it 1
had 1
ever 1
been 1
to 1
command 1
and 1
to 1
be 1
obeyed 1
His 1
manner 1
was 1
brisk 1
and 1
yet 1
his 1
general 1
appearance 1
gave 1
an 1
undue 1
impression 1
of 1
age 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
slight 1
forward 1
stoop 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
bend 1
of 1
the 1
knees 1
as 1
he 1
walked 1
His 1
hair 1
too 1
as 1
he 1
swept 1
off 1
his 1
very 1
curly 1
brimmed 1
hat 1
was 1
grizzled 1
round 1
the 1
edges 1
and 1
thin 1
upon 1
the 1
top 1
As 1
to 1
his 1
dress 1
it 1
was 1
careful 1
to 1
the 1
verge 1
of 1
foppishness 1
with 1
high 1
collar 1
black 1
frock 1
coat 1
white 1
waistcoat 1
yellow 1
gloves 1
patent 1
leather 1
shoes 1
and 1
light 1
coloured 1
gaiters 1
He 1
advanced 1
slowly 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
turning 1
his 1
head 1
from 1
left 1
to 1
right 1
and 1
swinging 1
in 1
his 1
right 1
hand 1
the 1
cord 1
which 1
held 1
his 1
golden 1
eyeglasses 1
Good 1
day 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
said 1
Holmes 1
rising 1
and 1
bowing 1
Pray 1
take 1
the 1
basket 1
chair 1
This 1
is 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
colleague 1
Dr 1
Watson 1
Draw 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
to 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
we 1
will 1
talk 1
this 1
matter 1
over 1
A 1
most 1
painful 1
matter 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
most 1
readily 1
imagine 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
cut 1
to 1
the 1
quick 1
I 1
understand 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
already 1
managed 1
several 1
delicate 1
cases 1
of 1
this 1
sort 1
sir 1
though 1
I 1
presume 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
hardly 1
from 1
the 1
same 1
class 1
of 1
society 1
No 1
I 1
am 1
descending 1
I 1
beg 1
pardon 1
My 1
last 1
client 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
was 1
a 1
king 1
Oh 1
really 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
And 1
which 1
king 1
The 1
King 1
of 1
Scandinavia 1
What 1
Had 1
he 1
lost 1
his 1
wife 1
You 1
can 1
understand 1
said 1
Holmes 1
suavely 1
that 1
I 1
extend 1
to 1
the 1
affairs 1
of 1
my 1
other 1
clients 1
the 1
same 1
secrecy 1
which 1
I 1
promise 1
to 1
you 1
in 1
yours 1
Of 1
course 1
Very 1
right 1
very 1
right 1
I 1
m 1
sure 1
I 1
beg 1
pardon 1
As 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
case 1
I 1
am 1
ready 1
to 1
give 1
you 1
any 1
information 1
which 1
may 1
assist 1
you 1
in 1
forming 1
an 1
opinion 1
Thank 1
you 1
I 1
have 1
already 1
learned 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
public 1
prints 1
nothing 1
more 1
I 1
presume 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
take 1
it 1
as 1
correct 1
this 1
article 1
for 1
example 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
disappearance 1
of 1
the 1
bride 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
glanced 1
over 1
it 1
Yes 1
it 1
is 1
correct 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
it 1
goes 1
But 1
it 1
needs 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
supplementing 1
before 1
anyone 1
could 1
offer 1
an 1
opinion 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
arrive 1
at 1
my 1
facts 1
most 1
directly 1
by 1
questioning 1
you 1
Pray 1
do 1
so 1
When 1
did 1
you 1
first 1
meet 1
Miss 1
Hatty 1
Doran 1
In 1
San 1
Francisco 1
a 1
year 1
ago 1
You 1
were 1
travelling 1
in 1
the 1
States 1
Yes 1
Did 1
you 1
become 1
engaged 1
then 1
No 1
But 1
you 1
were 1
on 1
a 1
friendly 1
footing 1
I 1
was 1
amused 1
by 1
her 1
society 1
and 1
she 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
amused 1
Her 1
father 1
is 1
very 1
rich 1
He 1
is 1
said 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
richest 1
man 1
on 1
the 1
Pacific 1
slope 1
And 1
how 1
did 1
he 1
make 1
his 1
money 1
In 1
mining 1
He 1
had 1
nothing 1
a 1
few 1
years 1
ago 1
Then 1
he 1
struck 1
gold 1
invested 1
it 1
and 1
came 1
up 1
by 1
leaps 1
and 1
bounds 1
Now 1
what 1
is 1
your 1
own 1
impression 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
s 1
your 1
wife 1
s 1
character 1
The 1
nobleman 1
swung 1
his 1
glasses 1
a 1
little 1
faster 1
and 1
stared 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
fire 1
You 1
see 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
said 1
he 1
my 1
wife 1
was 1
twenty 1
before 1
her 1
father 1
became 1
a 1
rich 1
man 1
During 1
that 1
time 1
she 1
ran 1
free 1
in 1
a 1
mining 1
camp 1
and 1
wandered 1
through 1
woods 1
or 1
mountains 1
so 1
that 1
her 1
education 1
has 1
come 1
from 1
Nature 1
rather 1
than 1
from 1
the 1
schoolmaster 1
She 1
is 1
what 1
we 1
call 1
in 1
England 1
a 1
tomboy 1
with 1
a 1
strong 1
nature 1
wild 1
and 1
free 1
unfettered 1
by 1
any 1
sort 1
of 1
traditions 1
She 1
is 1
impetuous 1
volcanic 1
I 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
say 1
She 1
is 1
swift 1
in 1
making 1
up 1
her 1
mind 1
and 1
fearless 1
in 1
carrying 1
out 1
her 1
resolutions 1
On 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
given 1
her 1
the 1
name 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
the 1
honour 1
to 1
bear 1
he 1
gave 1
a 1
little 1
stately 1
cough 1
had 1
not 1
I 1
thought 1
her 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
bottom 1
a 1
noble 1
woman 1
I 1
believe 1
that 1
she 1
is 1
capable 1
of 1
heroic 1
self 1
sacrifice 1
and 1
that 1
anything 1
dishonourable 1
would 1
be 1
repugnant 1
to 1
her 1
Have 1
you 1
her 1
photograph 1
I 1
brought 1
this 1
with 1
me 1
He 1
opened 1
a 1
locket 1
and 1
showed 1
us 1
the 1
full 1
face 1
of 1
a 1
very 1
lovely 1
woman 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
photograph 1
but 1
an 1
ivory 1
miniature 1
and 1
the 1
artist 1
had 1
brought 1
out 1
the 1
full 1
effect 1
of 1
the 1
lustrous 1
black 1
hair 1
the 1
large 1
dark 1
eyes 1
and 1
the 1
exquisite 1
mouth 1
Holmes 1
gazed 1
long 1
and 1
earnestly 1
at 1
it 1
Then 1
he 1
closed 1
the 1
locket 1
and 1
handed 1
it 1
back 1
to 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
The 1
young 1
lady 1
came 1
to 1
London 1
then 1
and 1
you 1
renewed 1
your 1
acquaintance 1
Yes 1
her 1
father 1
brought 1
her 1
over 1
for 1
this 1
last 1
London 1
season 1
I 1
met 1
her 1
several 1
times 1
became 1
engaged 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
have 1
now 1
married 1
her 1
She 1
brought 1
I 1
understand 1
a 1
considerable 1
dowry 1
A 1
fair 1
dowry 1
Not 1
more 1
than 1
is 1
usual 1
in 1
my 1
family 1
And 1
this 1
of 1
course 1
remains 1
to 1
you 1
since 1
the 1
marriage 1
is 1
a 1
fait 1
accompli 1
I 1
really 1
have 1
made 1
no 1
inquiries 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
Very 1
naturally 1
not 1
Did 1
you 1
see 1
Miss 1
Doran 1
on 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
the 1
wedding 1
Yes 1
Was 1
she 1
in 1
good 1
spirits 1
Never 1
better 1
She 1
kept 1
talking 1
of 1
what 1
we 1
should 1
do 1
in 1
our 1
future 1
lives 1
Indeed 1
That 1
is 1
very 1
interesting 1
And 1
on 1
the 1
morning 1
of 1
the 1
wedding 1
She 1
was 1
as 1
bright 1
as 1
possible 1
at 1
least 1
until 1
after 1
the 1
ceremony 1
And 1
did 1
you 1
observe 1
any 1
change 1
in 1
her 1
then 1
Well 1
to 1
tell 1
the 1
truth 1
I 1
saw 1
then 1
the 1
first 1
signs 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
ever 1
seen 1
that 1
her 1
temper 1
was 1
just 1
a 1
little 1
sharp 1
The 1
incident 1
however 1
was 1
too 1
trivial 1
to 1
relate 1
and 1
can 1
have 1
no 1
possible 1
bearing 1
upon 1
the 1
case 1
Pray 1
let 1
us 1
have 1
it 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
Oh 1
it 1
is 1
childish 1
She 1
dropped 1
her 1
bouquet 1
as 1
we 1
went 1
towards 1
the 1
vestry 1
She 1
was 1
passing 1
the 1
front 1
pew 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
it 1
fell 1
over 1
into 1
the 1
pew 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
moment 1
s 1
delay 1
but 1
the 1
gentleman 1
in 1
the 1
pew 1
handed 1
it 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
again 1
and 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
appear 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
worse 1
for 1
the 1
fall 1
Yet 1
when 1
I 1
spoke 1
to 1
her 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
she 1
answered 1
me 1
abruptly 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
carriage 1
on 1
our 1
way 1
home 1
she 1
seemed 1
absurdly 1
agitated 1
over 1
this 1
trifling 1
cause 1
Indeed 1
You 1
say 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
gentleman 1
in 1
the 1
pew 1
Some 1
of 1
the 1
general 1
public 1
were 1
present 1
then 1
Oh 1
yes 1
It 1
is 1
impossible 1
to 1
exclude 1
them 1
when 1
the 1
church 1
is 1
open 1
This 1
gentleman 1
was 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
your 1
wife 1
s 1
friends 1
No 1
no 1
I 1
call 1
him 1
a 1
gentleman 1
by 1
courtesy 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
quite 1
a 1
common 1
looking 1
person 1
I 1
hardly 1
noticed 1
his 1
appearance 1
But 1
really 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
wandering 1
rather 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
point 1
Lady 1
St 1
Simon 1
then 1
returned 1
from 1
the 1
wedding 1
in 1
a 1
less 1
cheerful 1
frame 1
of 1
mind 1
than 1
she 1
had 1
gone 1
to 1
it 1
What 1
did 1
she 1
do 1
on 1
re 1
entering 1
her 1
father 1
s 1
house 1
I 1
saw 1
her 1
in 1
conversation 1
with 1
her 1
maid 1
And 1
who 1
is 1
her 1
maid 1
Alice 1
is 1
her 1
name 1
She 1
is 1
an 1
American 1
and 1
came 1
from 1
California 1
with 1
her 1
A 1
confidential 1
servant 1
A 1
little 1
too 1
much 1
so 1
It 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
her 1
mistress 1
allowed 1
her 1
to 1
take 1
great 1
liberties 1
Still 1
of 1
course 1
in 1
America 1
they 1
look 1
upon 1
these 1
things 1
in 1
a 1
different 1
way 1
How 1
long 1
did 1
she 1
speak 1
to 1
this 1
Alice 1
Oh 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
I 1
had 1
something 1
else 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
You 1
did 1
not 1
overhear 1
what 1
they 1
said 1
Lady 1
St 1
Simon 1
said 1
something 1
about 1
jumping 1
a 1
claim 1
She 1
was 1
accustomed 1
to 1
use 1
slang 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
idea 1
what 1
she 1
meant 1
American 1
slang 1
is 1
very 1
expressive 1
sometimes 1
And 1
what 1
did 1
your 1
wife 1
do 1
when 1
she 1
finished 1
speaking 1
to 1
her 1
maid 1
She 1
walked 1
into 1
the 1
breakfast 1
room 1
On 1
your 1
arm 1
No 1
alone 1
She 1
was 1
very 1
independent 1
in 1
little 1
matters 1
like 1
that 1
Then 1
after 1
we 1
had 1
sat 1
down 1
for 1
ten 1
minutes 1
or 1
so 1
she 1
rose 1
hurriedly 1
muttered 1
some 1
words 1
of 1
apology 1
and 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
She 1
never 1
came 1
back 1
But 1
this 1
maid 1
Alice 1
as 1
I 1
understand 1
deposes 1
that 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
her 1
room 1
covered 1
her 1
bride 1
s 1
dress 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
ulster 1
put 1
on 1
a 1
bonnet 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
Quite 1
so 1
And 1
she 1
was 1
afterwards 1
seen 1
walking 1
into 1
Hyde 1
Park 1
in 1
company 1
with 1
Flora 1
Millar 1
a 1
woman 1
who 1
is 1
now 1
in 1
custody 1
and 1
who 1
had 1
already 1
made 1
a 1
disturbance 1
at 1
Mr 1
Doran 1
s 1
house 1
that 1
morning 1
Ah 1
yes 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
a 1
few 1
particulars 1
as 1
to 1
this 1
young 1
lady 1
and 1
your 1
relations 1
to 1
her 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
and 1
raised 1
his 1
eyebrows 1
We 1
have 1
been 1
on 1
a 1
friendly 1
footing 1
for 1
some 1
years 1
I 1
may 1
say 1
on 1
a 1
very 1
friendly 1
footing 1
She 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
the 1
Allegro 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
treated 1
her 1
ungenerously 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
just 1
cause 1
of 1
complaint 1
against 1
me 1
but 1
you 1
know 1
what 1
women 1
are 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
Flora 1
was 1
a 1
dear 1
little 1
thing 1
but 1
exceedingly 1
hot 1
headed 1
and 1
devotedly 1
attached 1
to 1
me 1
She 1
wrote 1
me 1
dreadful 1
letters 1
when 1
she 1
heard 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
and 1
to 1
tell 1
the 1
truth 1
the 1
reason 1
why 1
I 1
had 1
the 1
marriage 1
celebrated 1
so 1
quietly 1
was 1
that 1
I 1
feared 1
lest 1
there 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
scandal 1
in 1
the 1
church 1
She 1
came 1
to 1
Mr 1
Doran 1
s 1
door 1
just 1
after 1
we 1
returned 1
and 1
she 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
push 1
her 1
way 1
in 1
uttering 1
very 1
abusive 1
expressions 1
towards 1
my 1
wife 1
and 1
even 1
threatening 1
her 1
but 1
I 1
had 1
foreseen 1
the 1
possibility 1
of 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
two 1
police 1
fellows 1
there 1
in 1
private 1
clothes 1
who 1
soon 1
pushed 1
her 1
out 1
again 1
She 1
was 1
quiet 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
good 1
in 1
making 1
a 1
row 1
Did 1
your 1
wife 1
hear 1
all 1
this 1
No 1
thank 1
goodness 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
And 1
she 1
was 1
seen 1
walking 1
with 1
this 1
very 1
woman 1
afterwards 1
Yes 1
That 1
is 1
what 1
Mr 1
Lestrade 1
of 1
Scotland 1
Yard 1
looks 1
upon 1
as 1
so 1
serious 1
It 1
is 1
thought 1
that 1
Flora 1
decoyed 1
my 1
wife 1
out 1
and 1
laid 1
some 1
terrible 1
trap 1
for 1
her 1
Well 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
possible 1
supposition 1
You 1
think 1
so 1
too 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
say 1
a 1
probable 1
one 1
But 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
yourself 1
look 1
upon 1
this 1
as 1
likely 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
Flora 1
would 1
hurt 1
a 1
fly 1
Still 1
jealousy 1
is 1
a 1
strange 1
transformer 1
of 1
characters 1
Pray 1
what 1
is 1
your 1
own 1
theory 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
took 1
place 1
Well 1
really 1
I 1
came 1
to 1
seek 1
a 1
theory 1
not 1
to 1
propound 1
one 1
I 1
have 1
given 1
you 1
all 1
the 1
facts 1
Since 1
you 1
ask 1
me 1
however 1
I 1
may 1
say 1
that 1
it 1
has 1
occurred 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
possible 1
that 1
the 1
excitement 1
of 1
this 1
affair 1
the 1
consciousness 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
made 1
so 1
immense 1
a 1
social 1
stride 1
had 1
the 1
effect 1
of 1
causing 1
some 1
little 1
nervous 1
disturbance 1
in 1
my 1
wife 1
In 1
short 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
become 1
suddenly 1
deranged 1
Well 1
really 1
when 1
I 1
consider 1
that 1
she 1
has 1
turned 1
her 1
back 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
say 1
upon 1
me 1
but 1
upon 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
many 1
have 1
aspired 1
to 1
without 1
success 1
I 1
can 1
hardly 1
explain 1
it 1
in 1
any 1
other 1
fashion 1
Well 1
certainly 1
that 1
is 1
also 1
a 1
conceivable 1
hypothesis 1
said 1
Holmes 1
smiling 1
And 1
now 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
nearly 1
all 1
my 1
data 1
May 1
I 1
ask 1
whether 1
you 1
were 1
seated 1
at 1
the 1
breakfast 1
table 1
so 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
We 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
road 1
and 1
the 1
Park 1
Quite 1
so 1
Then 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
need 1
to 1
detain 1
you 1
longer 1
I 1
shall 1
communicate 1
with 1
you 1
Should 1
you 1
be 1
fortunate 1
enough 1
to 1
solve 1
this 1
problem 1
said 1
our 1
client 1
rising 1
I 1
have 1
solved 1
it 1
Eh 1
What 1
was 1
that 1
I 1
say 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
solved 1
it 1
Where 1
then 1
is 1
my 1
wife 1
That 1
is 1
a 1
detail 1
which 1
I 1
shall 1
speedily 1
supply 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
it 1
will 1
take 1
wiser 1
heads 1
than 1
yours 1
or 1
mine 1
he 1
remarked 1
and 1
bowing 1
in 1
a 1
stately 1
old 1
fashioned 1
manner 1
he 1
departed 1
It 1
is 1
very 1
good 1
of 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
to 1
honour 1
my 1
head 1
by 1
putting 1
it 1
on 1
a 1
level 1
with 1
his 1
own 1
said 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
laughing 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
shall 1
have 1
a 1
whisky 1
and 1
soda 1
and 1
a 1
cigar 1
after 1
all 1
this 1
cross 1
questioning 1
I 1
had 1
formed 1
my 1
conclusions 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
case 1
before 1
our 1
client 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
My 1
dear 1
Holmes 1
I 1
have 1
notes 1
of 1
several 1
similar 1
cases 1
though 1
none 1
as 1
I 1
remarked 1
before 1
which 1
were 1
quite 1
as 1
prompt 1
My 1
whole 1
examination 1
served 1
to 1
turn 1
my 1
conjecture 1
into 1
a 1
certainty 1
Circumstantial 1
evidence 1
is 1
occasionally 1
very 1
convincing 1
as 1
when 1
you 1
find 1
a 1
trout 1
in 1
the 1
milk 1
to 1
quote 1
Thoreau 1
s 1
example 1
But 1
I 1
have 1
heard 1
all 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
heard 1
Without 1
however 1
the 1
knowledge 1
of 1
pre 1
existing 1
cases 1
which 1
serves 1
me 1
so 1
well 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
parallel 1
instance 1
in 1
Aberdeen 1
some 1
years 1
back 1
and 1
something 1
on 1
very 1
much 1
the 1
same 1
lines 1
at 1
Munich 1
the 1
year 1
after 1
the 1
Franco 1
Prussian 1
War 1
It 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
cases 1
but 1
hullo 1
here 1
is 1
Lestrade 1
Good 1
afternoon 1
Lestrade 1
You 1
will 1
find 1
an 1
extra 1
tumbler 1
upon 1
the 1
sideboard 1
and 1
there 1
are 1
cigars 1
in 1
the 1
box 1
The 1
official 1
detective 1
was 1
attired 1
in 1
a 1
pea 1
jacket 1
and 1
cravat 1
which 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
decidedly 1
nautical 1
appearance 1
and 1
he 1
carried 1
a 1
black 1
canvas 1
bag 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
With 1
a 1
short 1
greeting 1
he 1
seated 1
himself 1
and 1
lit 1
the 1
cigar 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
offered 1
to 1
him 1
What 1
s 1
up 1
then 1
asked 1
Holmes 1
with 1
a 1
twinkle 1
in 1
his 1
eye 1
You 1
look 1
dissatisfied 1
And 1
I 1
feel 1
dissatisfied 1
It 1
is 1
this 1
infernal 1
St 1
Simon 1
marriage 1
case 1
I 1
can 1
make 1
neither 1
head 1
nor 1
tail 1
of 1
the 1
business 1
Really 1
You 1
surprise 1
me 1
Who 1
ever 1
heard 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
mixed 1
affair 1
Every 1
clue 1
seems 1
to 1
slip 1
through 1
my 1
fingers 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
at 1
work 1
upon 1
it 1
all 1
day 1
And 1
very 1
wet 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
made 1
you 1
said 1
Holmes 1
laying 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
the 1
arm 1
of 1
the 1
pea 1
jacket 1
Yes 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
dragging 1
the 1
Serpentine 1
In 1
heaven 1
s 1
name 1
what 1
for 1
In 1
search 1
of 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
Lady 1
St 1
Simon 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
leaned 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
laughed 1
heartily 1
Have 1
you 1
dragged 1
the 1
basin 1
of 1
Trafalgar 1
Square 1
fountain 1
he 1
asked 1
Why 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
Because 1
you 1
have 1
just 1
as 1
good 1
a 1
chance 1
of 1
finding 1
this 1
lady 1
in 1
the 1
one 1
as 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
Lestrade 1
shot 1
an 1
angry 1
glance 1
at 1
my 1
companion 1
I 1
suppose 1
you 1
know 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
he 1
snarled 1
Well 1
I 1
have 1
only 1
just 1
heard 1
the 1
facts 1
but 1
my 1
mind 1
is 1
made 1
up 1
Oh 1
indeed 1
Then 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
the 1
Serpentine 1
plays 1
no 1
part 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
very 1
unlikely 1
Then 1
perhaps 1
you 1
will 1
kindly 1
explain 1
how 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
we 1
found 1
this 1
in 1
it 1
He 1
opened 1
his 1
bag 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
and 1
tumbled 1
onto 1
the 1
floor 1
a 1
wedding 1
dress 1
of 1
watered 1
silk 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
white 1
satin 1
shoes 1
and 1
a 1
bride 1
s 1
wreath 1
and 1
veil 1
all 1
discoloured 1
and 1
soaked 1
in 1
water 1
There 1
said 1
he 1
putting 1
a 1
new 1
wedding 1
ring 1
upon 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
pile 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
nut 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
crack 1
Master 1
Holmes 1
Oh 1
indeed 1
said 1
my 1
friend 1
blowing 1
blue 1
rings 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
You 1
dragged 1
them 1
from 1
the 1
Serpentine 1
No 1
They 1
were 1
found 1
floating 1
near 1
the 1
margin 1
by 1
a 1
park 1
keeper 1
They 1
have 1
been 1
identified 1
as 1
her 1
clothes 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
if 1
the 1
clothes 1
were 1
there 1
the 1
body 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
far 1
off 1
By 1
the 1
same 1
brilliant 1
reasoning 1
every 1
man 1
s 1
body 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
his 1
wardrobe 1
And 1
pray 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
hope 1
to 1
arrive 1
at 1
through 1
this 1
At 1
some 1
evidence 1
implicating 1
Flora 1
Millar 1
in 1
the 1
disappearance 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
it 1
difficult 1
Are 1
you 1
indeed 1
now 1
cried 1
Lestrade 1
with 1
some 1
bitterness 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
Holmes 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
very 1
practical 1
with 1
your 1
deductions 1
and 1
your 1
inferences 1
You 1
have 1
made 1
two 1
blunders 1
in 1
as 1
many 1
minutes 1
This 1
dress 1
does 1
implicate 1
Miss 1
Flora 1
Millar 1
And 1
how 1
In 1
the 1
dress 1
is 1
a 1
pocket 1
In 1
the 1
pocket 1
is 1
a 1
card 1
case 1
In 1
the 1
card 1
case 1
is 1
a 1
note 1
And 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
very 1
note 1
He 1
slapped 1
it 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
Listen 1
to 1
this 1
You 1
will 1
see 1
me 1
when 1
all 1
is 1
ready 1
Come 1
at 1
once 1
F 1
H 1
M 1
Now 1
my 1
theory 1
all 1
along 1
has 1
been 1
that 1
Lady 1
St 1
Simon 1
was 1
decoyed 1
away 1
by 1
Flora 1
Millar 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
with 1
confederates 1
no 1
doubt 1
was 1
responsible 1
for 1
her 1
disappearance 1
Here 1
signed 1
with 1
her 1
initials 1
is 1
the 1
very 1
note 1
which 1
was 1
no 1
doubt 1
quietly 1
slipped 1
into 1
her 1
hand 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
which 1
lured 1
her 1
within 1
their 1
reach 1
Very 1
good 1
Lestrade 1
said 1
Holmes 1
laughing 1
You 1
really 1
are 1
very 1
fine 1
indeed 1
Let 1
me 1
see 1
it 1
He 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
paper 1
in 1
a 1
listless 1
way 1
but 1
his 1
attention 1
instantly 1
became 1
riveted 1
and 1
he 1
gave 1
a 1
little 1
cry 1
of 1
satisfaction 1
This 1
is 1
indeed 1
important 1
said 1
he 1
Ha 1
you 1
find 1
it 1
so 1
Extremely 1
so 1
I 1
congratulate 1
you 1
warmly 1
Lestrade 1
rose 1
in 1
his 1
triumph 1
and 1
bent 1
his 1
head 1
to 1
look 1
Why 1
he 1
shrieked 1
you 1
re 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
wrong 1
side 1
On 1
the 1
contrary 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
right 1
side 1
The 1
right 1
side 1
You 1
re 1
mad 1
Here 1
is 1
the 1
note 1
written 1
in 1
pencil 1
over 1
here 1
And 1
over 1
here 1
is 1
what 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
fragment 1
of 1
a 1
hotel 1
bill 1
which 1
interests 1
me 1
deeply 1
There 1
s 1
nothing 1
in 1
it 1
I 1
looked 1
at 1
it 1
before 1
said 1
Lestrade 1
Oct 1

nothing 1
in 1

Very 1
likely 1
not 1
It 1
is 1
most 1
important 1
all 1
the 1
same 1
As 1
to 1
the 1
note 1
it 1
is 1
important 1
also 1
or 1
at 1
least 1
the 1
initials 1
are 1
so 1
I 1
congratulate 1
you 1
again 1
I 1
ve 1
wasted 1
time 1
enough 1
said 1
Lestrade 1
rising 1
I 1
believe 1
in 1
hard 1
work 1
and 1
not 1
in 1
sitting 1
by 1
the 1

Good 1
day 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
which 1
gets 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
first 1
He 1
gathered 1
up 1
the 1
garments 1
thrust 1
them 1
into 1
the 1
bag 1
and 1
made 1
for 1
the 1
door 1
Just 1
one 1
hint 1
to 1
you 1
Lestrade 1
drawled 1
Holmes 1
before 1
his 1
rival 1
vanished 1
I 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
the 1
true 1
solution 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
Lady 1
St 1
Simon 1
is 1
a 1
myth 1
There 1
is 1
not 1
and 1
there 1
never 1
has 1
been 1
any 1
such 1
person 1
Lestrade 1
looked 1
sadly 1
at 1
my 1
companion 1
Then 1
he 1
turned 1
to 1
me 1
tapped 1
his 1
forehead 1
three 1
times 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
solemnly 1
and 1
hurried 1
away 1
He 1
had 1
hardly 1
shut 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
him 1
when 1
Holmes 1
rose 1
to 1
put 1
on 1
his 1
overcoat 1
There 1
is 1
something 1
in 1
what 1
the 1
fellow 1
says 1
about 1
outdoor 1
work 1
he 1
remarked 1
so 1
I 1
think 1
Watson 1
that 1
I 1
must 1
leave 1
you 1
to 1
your 1
papers 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
It 1
was 1
after 1
five 1
o 1
clock 1
when 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
left 1
me 1
but 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
be 1
lonely 1
for 1
within 1
an 1
hour 1
there 1
arrived 1
a 1
confectioner 1
s 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
large 1
flat 1
box 1
This 1
he 1
unpacked 1
with 1
the 1
help 1
of 1
a 1
youth 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
brought 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
presently 1
to 1
my 1
very 1
great 1
astonishment 1
a 1
quite 1
epicurean 1
little 1
cold 1
supper 1
began 1
to 1
be 1
laid 1
out 1
upon 1
our 1
humble 1
lodging 1
house 1
mahogany 1
There 1
were 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
brace 1
of 1
cold 1
woodcock 1
a 1
pheasant 1
a 1
pate 1
de 1
foie 1
gras 1
pie 1
with 1
a 1
group 1
of 1
ancient 1
and 1
cobwebby 1
bottles 1
Having 1
laid 1
out 1
all 1
these 1
luxuries 1
my 1
two 1
visitors 1
vanished 1
away 1
like 1
the 1
genii 1
of 1
the 1
Arabian 1
Nights 1
with 1
no 1
explanation 1
save 1
that 1
the 1
things 1
had 1
been 1
paid 1
for 1
and 1
were 1
ordered 1
to 1
this 1
address 1
Just 1
before 1
nine 1
o 1
clock 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
stepped 1
briskly 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
His 1
features 1
were 1
gravely 1
set 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
light 1
in 1
his 1
eye 1
which 1
made 1
me 1
think 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
disappointed 1
in 1
his 1
conclusions 1
They 1
have 1
laid 1
the 1
supper 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
rubbing 1
his 1
hands 1
You 1
seem 1
to 1
expect 1
company 1
They 1
have 1
laid 1
for 1
five 1
Yes 1
I 1
fancy 1
we 1
may 1
have 1
some 1
company 1
dropping 1
in 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
am 1
surprised 1
that 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
has 1
not 1
already 1
arrived 1
Ha 1
I 1
fancy 1
that 1
I 1
hear 1
his 1
step 1
now 1
upon 1
the 1
stairs 1
It 1
was 1
indeed 1
our 1
visitor 1
of 1
the 1
afternoon 1
who 1
came 1
bustling 1
in 1
dangling 1
his 1
glasses 1
more 1
vigorously 1
than 1
ever 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
perturbed 1
expression 1
upon 1
his 1
aristocratic 1
features 1
My 1
messenger 1
reached 1
you 1
then 1
asked 1
Holmes 1
Yes 1
and 1
I 1
confess 1
that 1
the 1
contents 1
startled 1
me 1
beyond 1
measure 1
Have 1
you 1
good 1
authority 1
for 1
what 1
you 1
say 1
The 1
best 1
possible 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
sank 1
into 1
a 1
chair 1
and 1
passed 1
his 1
hand 1
over 1
his 1
forehead 1
What 1
will 1
the 1
Duke 1
say 1
he 1
murmured 1
when 1
he 1
hears 1
that 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
has 1
been 1
subjected 1
to 1
such 1
humiliation 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
purest 1
accident 1
I 1
cannot 1
allow 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
any 1
humiliation 1
Ah 1
you 1
look 1
on 1
these 1
things 1
from 1
another 1
standpoint 1
I 1
fail 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
anyone 1
is 1
to 1
blame 1
I 1
can 1
hardly 1
see 1
how 1
the 1
lady 1
could 1
have 1
acted 1
otherwise 1
though 1
her 1
abrupt 1
method 1
of 1
doing 1
it 1
was 1
undoubtedly 1
to 1
be 1
regretted 1
Having 1
no 1
mother 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
one 1
to 1
advise 1
her 1
at 1
such 1
a 1
crisis 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
slight 1
sir 1
a 1
public 1
slight 1
said 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
tapping 1
his 1
fingers 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
You 1
must 1
make 1
allowance 1
for 1
this 1
poor 1
girl 1
placed 1
in 1
so 1
unprecedented 1
a 1
position 1
I 1
will 1
make 1
no 1
allowance 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
angry 1
indeed 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
shamefully 1
used 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
heard 1
a 1
ring 1
said 1
Holmes 1
Yes 1
there 1
are 1
steps 1
on 1
the 1
landing 1
If 1
I 1
cannot 1
persuade 1
you 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
lenient 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
I 1
have 1
brought 1
an 1
advocate 1
here 1
who 1
may 1
be 1
more 1
successful 1
He 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
ushered 1
in 1
a 1
lady 1
and 1
gentleman 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
said 1
he 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
introduce 1
you 1
to 1
Mr 1
and 1
Mrs 1
Francis 1
Hay 1
Moulton 1
The 1
lady 1
I 1
think 1
you 1
have 1
already 1
met 1
At 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
these 1
newcomers 1
our 1
client 1
had 1
sprung 1
from 1
his 1
seat 1
and 1
stood 1
very 1
erect 1
with 1
his 1
eyes 1
cast 1
down 1
and 1
his 1
hand 1
thrust 1
into 1
the 1
breast 1
of 1
his 1
frock 1
coat 1
a 1
picture 1
of 1
offended 1
dignity 1
The 1
lady 1
had 1
taken 1
a 1
quick 1
step 1
forward 1
and 1
had 1
held 1
out 1
her 1
hand 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
still 1
refused 1
to 1
raise 1
his 1
eyes 1
It 1
was 1
as 1
well 1
for 1
his 1
resolution 1
perhaps 1
for 1
her 1
pleading 1
face 1
was 1
one 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
hard 1
to 1
resist 1
You 1
re 1
angry 1
Robert 1
said 1
she 1
Well 1
I 1
guess 1
you 1
have 1
every 1
cause 1
to 1
be 1
Pray 1
make 1
no 1
apology 1
to 1
me 1
said 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
bitterly 1
Oh 1
yes 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
treated 1
you 1
real 1
bad 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
spoken 1
to 1
you 1
before 1
I 1
went 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
kind 1
of 1
rattled 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
time 1
when 1
I 1
saw 1
Frank 1
here 1
again 1
I 1
just 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
was 1
doing 1
or 1
saying 1
I 1
only 1
wonder 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
fall 1
down 1
and 1
do 1
a 1
faint 1
right 1
there 1
before 1
the 1
altar 1
Perhaps 1
Mrs 1
Moulton 1
you 1
would 1
like 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
me 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
room 1
while 1
you 1
explain 1
this 1
matter 1
If 1
I 1
may 1
give 1
an 1
opinion 1
remarked 1
the 1
strange 1
gentleman 1
we 1
ve 1
had 1
just 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
much 1
secrecy 1
over 1
this 1
business 1
already 1
For 1
my 1
part 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
all 1
Europe 1
and 1
America 1
to 1
hear 1
the 1
rights 1
of 1
it 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
wiry 1
sunburnt 1
man 1
clean 1
shaven 1
with 1
a 1
sharp 1
face 1
and 1
alert 1
manner 1
Then 1
I 1
ll 1
tell 1
our 1
story 1
right 1
away 1
said 1
the 1
lady 1
Frank 1
here 1
and 1
I 1
met 1
in 2
McQuire 1
s 1
camp 1
near 1
the 1
Rockies 1
where 1
pa 1
was 1
working 1
a 1
claim 1
We 1
were 1
engaged 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
Frank 1
and 1
I 1
but 1
then 1
one 1
day 1
father 1
struck 1
a 1
rich 1
pocket 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
pile 1
while 1
poor 1
Frank 1
here 1
had 1
a 1
claim 1
that 1
petered 1
out 1
and 1
came 1
to 1
nothing 1
The 1
richer 1
pa 1
grew 1
the 1
poorer 1
was 1
Frank 1
so 1
at 1
last 1
pa 1
wouldn 1
t 1
hear 1
of 1
our 1
engagement 1
lasting 1
any 1
longer 1
and 1
he 1
took 1
me 1
away 1
to 1
Frisco 1
Frank 1
wouldn 1
t 1
throw 1
up 1
his 1
hand 1
though 1
so 1
he 1
followed 1
me 1
there 1
and 1
he 1
saw 1
me 1
without 1
pa 1
knowing 1
anything 1
about 1
it 1
It 1
would 1
only 1
have 1
made 1
him 1
mad 1
to 1
know 1
so 1
we 1
just 1
fixed 1
it 1
all 1
up 1
for 1
ourselves 1
Frank 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
go 1
and 1
make 1
his 1
pile 1
too 1
and 1
never 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
claim 1
me 1
until 1
he 1
had 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
pa 1
So 1
then 1
I 1
promised 1
to 1
wait 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
time 1
and 1
pledged 1
myself 1
not 1
to 1
marry 1
anyone 1
else 1
while 1
he 1
lived 1
Why 1
shouldn 1
t 1
we 1
be 1
married 1
right 1
away 1
then 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
will 1
feel 1
sure 1
of 1
you 1
and 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
claim 1
to 1
be 1
your 1
husband 1
until 1
I 1
come 1
back 1
Well 1
we 1
talked 1
it 1
over 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
fixed 1
it 1
all 1
up 1
so 1
nicely 1
with 1
a 1
clergyman 1
all 1
ready 1
in 1
waiting 1
that 1
we 1
just 1
did 1
it 1
right 1
there 1
and 1
then 1
Frank 1
went 1
off 1
to 1
seek 1
his 1
fortune 1
and 1
I 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
pa 1
The 1
next 1
I 1
heard 1
of 1
Frank 1
was 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
Montana 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
prospecting 1
in 1
Arizona 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
heard 1
of 1
him 1
from 1
New 1
Mexico 1
After 1
that 1
came 1
a 1
long 1
newspaper 1
story 1
about 1
how 1
a 1
miners 1
camp 1
had 1
been 1
attacked 1
by 1
Apache 1
Indians 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
my 1
Frank 1
s 1
name 1
among 1
the 1
killed 1
I 1
fainted 1
dead 1
away 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
very 1
sick 1
for 1
months 1
after 1
Pa 1
thought 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
decline 1
and 1
took 1
me 1
to 1
half 1
the 1
doctors 1
in 1
Frisco 1
Not 1
a 1
word 1
of 1
news 1
came 1
for 1
a 1
year 1
and 1
more 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
never 1
doubted 1
that 1
Frank 1
was 1
really 1
dead 1
Then 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
came 1
to 1
Frisco 1
and 1
we 1
came 1
to 1
London 1
and 1
a 1
marriage 1
was 1
arranged 1
and 1
pa 1
was 1
very 1
pleased 1
but 1
I 1
felt 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
no 1
man 1
on 1
this 1
earth 1
would 1
ever 1
take 1
the 1
place 1
in 1
my 1
heart 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
given 1
to 1
my 1
poor 1
Frank 1
Still 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
married 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
of 1
course 1
I 1
d 1
have 1
done 1
my 1
duty 1
by 1
him 1
We 1
can 1
t 1
command 1
our 1
love 1
but 1
we 1
can 1
our 1
actions 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
altar 1
with 1
him 1
with 1
the 1
intention 1
to 1
make 1
him 1
just 1
as 1
good 1
a 1
wife 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
But 1
you 1
may 1
imagine 1
what 1
I 1
felt 1
when 1
just 1
as 1
I 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
altar 1
rails 1
I 1
glanced 1
back 1
and 1
saw 1
Frank 1
standing 1
and 1
looking 1
at 1
me 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
pew 1
I 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
ghost 1
at 1
first 1
but 1
when 1
I 1
looked 1
again 1
there 1
he 1
was 1
still 1
with 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
question 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
as 1
if 1
to 1
ask 1
me 1
whether 1
I 1
were 1
glad 1
or 1
sorry 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
I 1
wonder 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
drop 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
everything 1
was 1
turning 1
round 1
and 1
the 1
words 1
of 1
the 1
clergyman 1
were 1
just 1
like 1
the 1
buzz 1
of 1
a 1
bee 1
in 1
my 1
ear 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
Should 1
I 1
stop 1
the 1
service 1
and 1
make 1
a 1
scene 1
in 1
the 1
church 1
I 1
glanced 1
at 1
him 1
again 1
and 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
was 1
thinking 1
for 1
he 1
raised 1
his 1
finger 1
to 1
his 1
lips 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
still 1
Then 1
I 1
saw 1
him 1
scribble 1
on 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
paper 1
and 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
writing 1
me 1
a 1
note 1
As 1
I 1
passed 1
his 1
pew 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
out 1
I 1
dropped 1
my 1
bouquet 1
over 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
slipped 1
the 1
note 1
into 1
my 1
hand 1
when 1
he 1
returned 1
me 1
the 1
flowers 1
It 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
line 1
asking 1
me 1
to 1
join 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
made 1
the 1
sign 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
never 1
doubted 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
that 1
my 1
first 1
duty 1
was 1
now 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
I 1
determined 1
to 1
do 1
just 1
whatever 1
he 1
might 1
direct 1
When 1
I 1
got 1
back 1
I 1
told 1
my 1
maid 1
who 1
had 1
known 1
him 1
in 1
California 1
and 1
had 1
always 1
been 1
his 1
friend 1
I 1
ordered 1
her 1
to 1
say 1
nothing 1
but 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
few 1
things 1
packed 1
and 1
my 1
ulster 1
ready 1
I 1
know 1
I 1
ought 1
to 1
have 1
spoken 1
to 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
dreadful 1
hard 1
before 1
his 1
mother 1
and 1
all 1
those 1
great 1
people 1
I 1
just 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
and 1
explain 1
afterwards 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
been 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
ten 1
minutes 1
before 1
I 1
saw 1
Frank 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
road 1
He 1
beckoned 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
then 1
began 1
walking 1
into 1
the 1
Park 1
I 1
slipped 1
out 1
put 1
on 1
my 1
things 1
and 1
followed 1
him 1
Some 1
woman 1
came 1
talking 1
something 1
or 1
other 1
about 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
to 1
me 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
little 1
I 1
heard 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
little 1
secret 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
before 1
marriage 1
also 1
but 1
I 1
managed 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
from 1
her 1
and 1
soon 1
overtook 1
Frank 1
We 1
got 1
into 1
a 1
cab 1
together 1
and 1
away 1
we 1
drove 1
to 1
some 1
lodgings 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
in 1
Gordon 1
Square 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
my 1
true 1
wedding 1
after 1
all 1
those 1
years 1
of 1
waiting 1
Frank 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
prisoner 1
among 1
the 1
Apaches 1
had 1
escaped 1
came 1
on 1
to 1
Frisco 1
found 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
given 1
him 1
up 1
for 1
dead 1
and 1
had 1
gone 1
to 1
England 1
followed 1
me 1
there 1
and 1
had 1
come 1
upon 1
me 1
at 1
last 1
on 1
the 1
very 1
morning 1
of 1
my 1
second 1
wedding 1
I 1
saw 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
paper 1
explained 1
the 1
American 1
It 1
gave 1
the 1
name 1
and 1
the 1
church 1
but 1
not 1
where 1
the 1
lady 1
lived 1
Then 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
talk 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
we 1
should 1
do 1
and 1
Frank 1
was 1
all 1
for 1
openness 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
ashamed 1
of 1
it 1
all 1
that 1
I 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
vanish 1
away 1
and 1
never 1
see 1
any 1
of 1
them 1
again 1
just 1
sending 1
a 1
line 1
to 1
pa 1
perhaps 1
to 1
show 1
him 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
alive 1
It 1
was 1
awful 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
all 1
those 1
lords 1
and 1
ladies 1
sitting 1
round 1
that 1
breakfast 1
table 1
and 1
waiting 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
come 1
back 1
So 1
Frank 1
took 1
my 1
wedding 1
clothes 1
and 1
things 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
bundle 1
of 1
them 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
traced 1
and 1
dropped 1
them 1
away 1
somewhere 1
where 1
no 1
one 1
could 1
find 1
them 1
It 1
is 1
likely 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
have 1
gone 1
on 1
to 1
Paris 1
to 1
morrow 1
only 1
that 1
this 1
good 1
gentleman 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
came 1
round 1
to 1
us 1
this 1
evening 1
though 1
how 1
he 1
found 1
us 1
is 1
more 1
than 1
I 1
can 1
think 1
and 1
he 1
showed 1
us 1
very 1
clearly 1
and 1
kindly 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
wrong 1
and 1
that 1
Frank 1
was 1
right 1
and 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
be 1
putting 1
ourselves 1
in 1
the 1
wrong 1
if 1
we 1
were 1
so 1
secret 1
Then 1
he 1
offered 1
to 1
give 1
us 1
a 1
chance 1
of 1
talking 1
to 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
alone 1
and 1
so 1
we 1
came 1
right 1
away 1
round 1
to 1
his 1
rooms 1
at 1
once 1
Now 1
Robert 1
you 1
have 1
heard 1
it 1
all 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
sorry 1
if 1
I 1
have 1
given 1
you 1
pain 1
and 1
I 1
hope 1
that 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
very 1
meanly 1
of 1
me 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
had 1
by 1
no 1
means 1
relaxed 1
his 1
rigid 1
attitude 1
but 1
had 1
listened 1
with 1
a 1
frowning 1
brow 1
and 1
a 1
compressed 1
lip 1
to 1
this 1
long 1
narrative 1
Excuse 1
me 1
he 1
said 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
my 1
custom 1
to 1
discuss 1
my 1
most 1
intimate 1
personal 1
affairs 1
in 1
this 1
public 1
manner 1
Then 1
you 1
won 1
t 1
forgive 1
me 1
You 1
won 1
t 1
shake 1
hands 1
before 1
I 1
go 1
Oh 1
certainly 1
if 1
it 1
would 1
give 1
you 1
any 1
pleasure 1
He 1
put 1
out 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
coldly 1
grasped 1
that 1
which 1
she 1
extended 1
to 1
him 1
I 1
had 1
hoped 1
suggested 1
Holmes 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
joined 1
us 1
in 1
a 1
friendly 1
supper 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
there 1
you 1
ask 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
much 1
responded 1
his 1
Lordship 1
I 1
may 1
be 1
forced 1
to 1
acquiesce 1
in 1
these 1
recent 1
developments 1
but 1
I 1
can 1
hardly 1
be 1
expected 1
to 1
make 1
merry 1
over 1
them 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
with 1
your 1
permission 1
I 1
will 1
now 1
wish 1
you 1
all 1
a 1
very 1
good 1
night 1
He 1
included 1
us 1
all 1
in 1
a 1
sweeping 1
bow 1
and 1
stalked 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
Then 1
I 1
trust 1
that 1
you 1
at 1
least 1
will 1
honour 1
me 1
with 1
your 1
company 1
said 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
It 1
is 1
always 1
a 1
joy 1
to 1
meet 1
an 1
American 1
Mr 1
Moulton 1
for 1
I 1
am 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
believe 1
that 1
the 1
folly 1
of 1
a 1
monarch 1
and 1
the 1
blundering 1
of 1
a 1
minister 1
in 1
far 1
gone 1
years 1
will 1
not 1
prevent 1
our 1
children 1
from 1
being 1
some 1
day 1
citizens 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
world 1
wide 1
country 1
under 1
a 1
flag 1
which 1
shall 1
be 1
a 1
quartering 1
of 1
the 1
Union 1
Jack 1
with 1
the 1
Stars 1
and 1
Stripes 1
The 1
case 1
has 1
been 1
an 1
interesting 1
one 1
remarked 1
Holmes 1
when 1
our 1
visitors 1
had 1
left 1
us 1
because 1
it 1
serves 1
to 1
show 1
very 1
clearly 1
how 1
simple 1
the 1
explanation 1
may 1
be 1
of 1
an 1
affair 1
which 1
at 1
first 1
sight 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
almost 1
inexplicable 1
Nothing 1
could 1
be 1
more 1
natural 1
than 1
the 1
sequence 1
of 1
events 1
as 1
narrated 1
by 1
this 1
lady 1
and 1
nothing 1
stranger 1
than 1
the 1
result 1
when 1
viewed 1
for 1
instance 1
by 1
Mr 1
Lestrade 1
of 1
Scotland 1
Yard 1
You 1
were 1
not 1
yourself 1
at 1
fault 1
at 1
all 1
then 1
From 1
the 1
first 1
two 1
facts 1
were 1
very 1
obvious 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
the 1
lady 1
had 1
been 1
quite 1
willing 1
to 1
undergo 1
the 1
wedding 1
ceremony 1
the 1
other 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
repented 1
of 1
it 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
of 1
returning 1
home 1
Obviously 1
something 1
had 1
occurred 1
during 1
the 1
morning 1
then 1
to 1
cause 1
her 1
to 1
change 1
her 1
mind 1
What 1
could 1
that 1
something 1
be 1
She 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
spoken 1
to 1
anyone 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
out 1
for 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
Had 1
she 1
seen 1
someone 1
then 1
If 1
she 1
had 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
someone 1
from 1
America 1
because 1
she 1
had 1
spent 1
so 1
short 1
a 1
time 1
in 1
this 1
country 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
hardly 1
have 1
allowed 1
anyone 1
to 1
acquire 1
so 1
deep 1
an 1
influence 1
over 1
her 1
that 1
the 1
mere 1
sight 1
of 1
him 1
would 1
induce 1
her 1
to 1
change 1
her 1
plans 1
so 1
completely 1
You 1
see 1
we 1
have 1
already 1
arrived 1
by 1
a 1
process 1
of 1
exclusion 1
at 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
have 1
seen 1
an 1
American 1
Then 1
who 1
could 1
this 1
American 1
be 1
and 1
why 1
should 1
he 1
possess 1
so 1
much 1
influence 1
over 1
her 1
It 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
lover 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
husband 1
Her 1
young 1
womanhood 1
had 1
I 1
knew 1
been 1
spent 1
in 1
rough 1
scenes 1
and 1
under 1
strange 1
conditions 1
So 1
far 1
I 1
had 1
got 1
before 1
I 1
ever 1
heard 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
s 1
narrative 1
When 1
he 1
told 1
us 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
a 1
pew 1
of 1
the 1
change 1
in 1
the 1
bride 1
s 1
manner 1
of 1
so 1
transparent 1
a 1
device 1
for 1
obtaining 1
a 1
note 1
as 1
the 1
dropping 1
of 1
a 1
bouquet 1
of 1
her 1
resort 1
to 1
her 1
confidential 1
maid 1
and 1
of 1
her 1
very 1
significant 1
allusion 1
to 1
claim 1
jumping 1
which 1
in 1
miners 1
parlance 1
means 1
taking 1
possession 1
of 1
that 1
which 1
another 1
person 1
has 1
a 1
prior 1
claim 1
to 1
the 1
whole 1
situation 1
became 1
absolutely 1
clear 1
She 1
had 1
gone 1
off 1
with 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
either 1
a 1
lover 1
or 1
was 1
a 1
previous 1
husband 1
the 1
chances 1
being 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
the 1
latter 1
And 1
how 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
did 1
you 1
find 1
them 1
It 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
difficult 1
but 1
friend 1
Lestrade 1
held 1
information 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
the 1
value 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
himself 1
know 1
The 1
initials 1
were 1
of 1
course 1
of 1
the 1
highest 1
importance 1
but 1
more 1
valuable 1
still 1
was 1
it 1
to 1
know 1
that 1
within 1
a 1
week 1
he 1
had 1
settled 1
his 1
bill 1
at 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
select 1
London 1
hotels 1
How 1
did 1
you 1
deduce 1
the 1
select 1
By 1
the 1
select 1
prices 1
Eight 1
shillings 1
for 1
a 1
bed 1
and 1
eightpence 1
for 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
sherry 1
pointed 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
expensive 1
hotels 1
There 1
are 1
not 1
many 1
in 1
London 1
which 1
charge 1
at 1
that 1
rate 1
In 1
the 1
second 1
one 1
which 1
I 1
visited 1
in 1
Northumberland 1
Avenue 1
I 1
learned 1
by 1
an 1
inspection 1
of 1
the 1
book 1
that 1
Francis 1
H 1
Moulton 1
an 1
American 1
gentleman 1
had 1
left 1
only 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
and 1
on 1
looking 1
over 1
the 1
entries 1
against 1
him 1
I 1
came 1
upon 1
the 1
very 1
items 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
seen 1
in 1
the 1
duplicate 1
bill 1
His 1
letters 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
forwarded 1
to 1
Gordon 1
Square 1
so 1
thither 1
I 1
travelled 1
and 1
being 1
fortunate 1
enough 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
loving 1
couple 1
at 1
home 1
I 1
ventured 1
to 1
give 1
them 1
some 1
paternal 1
advice 1
and 1
to 1
point 1
out 1
to 1
them 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
better 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
that 1
they 1
should 1
make 1
their 1
position 1
a 1
little 1
clearer 1
both 1
to 1
the 1
general 1
public 1
and 1
to 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
in 1
particular 1
I 1
invited 1
them 1
to 1
meet 1
him 1
here 1
and 1
as 1
you 1
see 1
I 1
made 1
him 1
keep 1
the 1
appointment 1
But 1
with 1
no 1
very 1
good 1
result 1
I 1
remarked 1
His 1
conduct 1
was 1
certainly 1
not 1
very 1
gracious 1
Ah 1
Watson 1
said 1
Holmes 1
smiling 1
perhaps 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
very 1
gracious 1
either 1
if 1
after 1
all 1
the 1
trouble 1
of 1
wooing 1
and 1
wedding 1
you 1
found 1
yourself 1
deprived 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
of 1
wife 1
and 1
of 1
fortune 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
judge 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
very 1
mercifully 1
and 1
thank 1
our 1
stars 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
never 1
likely 1
to 1
find 1
ourselves 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
position 1
Draw 1
your 1
chair 1
up 1
and 1
hand 1
me 1
my 1
violin 1
for 1
the 1
only 1
problem 1
we 1
have 1
still 1
to 1
solve 1
is 1
how 1
to 1
while 1
away 1
these 1
bleak 1
autumnal 1
evenings 1
XI 1
THE 1
ADVENTURE 1
OF 1
THE 1
BERYL 1
CORONET 1
Holmes 1
said 1
I 1
as 1
I 1
stood 1
one 1
morning 1
in 1
our 1
bow 1
window 1
looking 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
here 1
is 1
a 1
madman 1
coming 1
along 1
It 1
seems 1
rather 1
sad 1
that 1
his 1
relatives 1
should 1
allow 1
him 1
to 1
come 1
out 1
alone 1
My 1
friend 1
rose 1
lazily 1
from 1
his 1
armchair 1
and 1
stood 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
in 1
the 1
pockets 1
of 1
his 1
dressing 1
gown 1
looking 1
over 1
my 1
shoulder 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
bright 1
crisp 1
February 1
morning 1
and 1
the 1
snow 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
still 1
lay 1
deep 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
shimmering 1
brightly 1
in 1
the 1
wintry 1
sun 1
Down 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
Baker 1
Street 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
ploughed 1
into 1
a 1
brown 1
crumbly 1
band 1
by 1
the 1
traffic 1
but 1
at 1
either 1
side 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
heaped 1
up 1
edges 1
of 1
the 1
foot 1
paths 1
it 1
still 1
lay 1
as 1
white 1
as 1
when 1
it 1
fell 1
The 1
grey 1
pavement 1
had 1
been 1
cleaned 1
and 1
scraped 1
but 1
was 1
still 1
dangerously 1
slippery 1
so 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
fewer 1
passengers 1
than 1
usual 1
Indeed 1
from 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
Metropolitan 1
Station 1
no 1
one 1
was 1
coming 1
save 1
the 1
single 1
gentleman 1
whose 1
eccentric 1
conduct 1
had 1
drawn 1
my 1
attention 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
about 1
fifty 1
tall 1
portly 1
and 1
imposing 1
with 1
a 1
massive 1
strongly 1
marked 1
face 1
and 1
a 1
commanding 1
figure 1
He 1
was 1
dressed 1
in 1
a 1
sombre 1
yet 1
rich 1
style 1
in 1
black 1
frock 1
coat 1
shining 1
hat 1
neat 1
brown 1
gaiters 1
and 1
well 1
cut 1
pearl 1
grey 1
trousers 1
Yet 1
his 1
actions 1
were 1
in 1
absurd 1
contrast 1
to 1
the 1
dignity 1
of 1
his 1
dress 1
and 1
features 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
running 1
hard 1
with 1
occasional 1
little 1
springs 1
such 1
as 1
a 1
weary 1
man 1
gives 1
who 1
is 1
little 1
accustomed 1
to 1
set 1
any 1
tax 1
upon 1
his 1
legs 1
As 1
he 1
ran 1
he 1
jerked 1
his 1
hands 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
waggled 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
writhed 1
his 1
face 1
into 1
the 1
most 1
extraordinary 1
contortions 1
What 1
on 1
earth 1
can 1
be 1
the 1
matter 1
with 1
him 1
I 1
asked 1
He 1
is 1
looking 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
numbers 1
of 1
the 1
houses 1
I 1
believe 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
coming 1
here 1
said 1
Holmes 1
rubbing 1
his 1
hands 1
Here 1
Yes 1
I 1
rather 1
think 1
he 1
is 1
coming 1
to 1
consult 1
me 1
professionally 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
recognise 1
the 1
symptoms 1
Ha 1
did 1
I 1
not 1
tell 1
you 1
As 1
he 1
spoke 1
the 1
man 1
puffing 1
and 1
blowing 1
rushed 1
at 1
our 1
door 1
and 1
pulled 1
at 1
our 1
bell 1
until 1
the 1
whole 1
house 1
resounded 1
with 1
the 1
clanging 1
A 1
few 1
moments 1
later 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
our 1
room 1
still 1
puffing 1
still 1
gesticulating 1
but 1
with 1
so 1
fixed 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
grief 1
and 1
despair 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
that 1
our 1
smiles 1
were 1
turned 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
to 1
horror 1
and 1
pity 1
For 1
a 1
while 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
get 1
his 1
words 1
out 1
but 1
swayed 1
his 1
body 1
and 1
plucked 1
at 1
his 1
hair 1
like 1
one 1
who 1
has 1
been 1
driven 1
to 1
the 1
extreme 1
limits 1
of 1
his 1
reason 1
Then 1
suddenly 1
springing 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
he 1
beat 1
his 1
head 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
with 1
such 1
force 1
that 1
we 1
both 1
rushed 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
tore 1
him 1
away 1
to 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
pushed 1
him 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
easy 1
chair 1
and 1
sitting 1
beside 1
him 1
patted 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
chatted 1
with 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
easy 1
soothing 1
tones 1
which 1
he 1
knew 1
so 1
well 1
how 1
to 1
employ 1
You 1
have 1
come 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
tell 1
your 1
story 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
said 1
he 1
You 1
are 1
fatigued 1
with 1
your 1
haste 1
Pray 1
wait 1
until 1
you 1
have 1
recovered 1
yourself 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
most 1
happy 1
to 1
look 1
into 1
any 1
little 1
problem 1
which 1
you 1
may 1
submit 1
to 1
me 1
The 1
man 1
sat 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
or 1
more 1
with 1
a 1
heaving 1
chest 1
fighting 1
against 1
his 1
emotion 1
Then 1
he 1
passed 1
his 1
handkerchief 1
over 1
his 1
brow 1
set 1
his 1
lips 1
tight 1
and 1
turned 1
his 1
face 1
towards 1
us 1
No 1
doubt 1
you 1
think 1
me 1
mad 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
see 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
had 1
some 1
great 1
trouble 1
responded 1
Holmes 1
God 1
knows 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
trouble 1
which 1
is 1
enough 1
to 1
unseat 1
my 1
reason 1
so 1
sudden 1
and 1
so 1
terrible 1
is 1
it 1
Public 1
disgrace 1
I 1
might 1
have 1
faced 1
although 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
man 1
whose 1
character 1
has 1
never 1
yet 1
borne 1
a 1
stain 1
Private 1
affliction 1
also 1
is 1
the 1
lot 1
of 1
every 1
man 1
but 1
the 1
two 1
coming 1
together 1
and 1
in 1
so 1
frightful 1
a 1
form 1
have 1
been 1
enough 1
to 1
shake 1
my 1
very 1
soul 1
Besides 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
I 1
alone 1
The 1
very 1
noblest 1
in 1
the 1
land 1
may 1
suffer 1
unless 1
some 1
way 1
be 1
found 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
horrible 1
affair 1
Pray 1
compose 1
yourself 1
sir 1
said 1
Holmes 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
a 1
clear 1
account 1
of 1
who 1
you 1
are 1
and 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
has 1
befallen 1
you 1
My 1
name 1
answered 1
our 1
visitor 1
is 1
probably 1
familiar 1
to 1
your 1
ears 1
I 1
am 1
Alexander 1
Holder 1
of 1
the 1
banking 1
firm 1
of 1
Holder 1
Stevenson 1
of 1
Threadneedle 1
Street 1
The 1
name 1
was 1
indeed 1
well 1
known 1
to 1
us 1
as 1
belonging 1
to 1
the 1
senior 1
partner 1
in 1
the 1
second 1
largest 1
private 1
banking 1
concern 1
in 1
the 1
City 1
of 1
London 1
What 1
could 1
have 1
happened 1
then 1
to 1
bring 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
foremost 1
citizens 1
of 1
London 1
to 1
this 1
most 1
pitiable 1
pass 1
We 1
waited 1
all 1
curiosity 1
until 1
with 1
another 1
effort 1
he 1
braced 1
himself 1
to 1
tell 1
his 1
story 1
I 1
feel 1
that 1
time 1
is 1
of 1
value 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
is 1
why 1
I 1
hastened 1
here 1
when 1
the 1
police 1
inspector 1
suggested 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
secure 1
your 1
co 1
operation 1
I 1
came 1
to 1
Baker 1
Street 1
by 1
the 1
Underground 1
and 1
hurried 1
from 1
there 1
on 1
foot 1
for 1
the 1
cabs 1
go 1
slowly 1
through 1
this 1
snow 1
That 1
is 1
why 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
out 1
of 1
breath 1
for 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
takes 1
very 1
little 1
exercise 1
I 1
feel 1
better 1
now 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
put 1
the 1
facts 1
before 1
you 1
as 1
shortly 1
and 1
yet 1
as 1
clearly 1
as 1
I 1
can 1
It 1
is 1
of 1
course 1
well 1
known 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
in 1
a 1
successful 1
banking 1
business 1
as 1
much 1
depends 1
upon 1
our 1
being 1
able 1
to 1
find 1
remunerative 1
investments 1
for 1
our 1
funds 1
as 1
upon 1
our 1
increasing 1
our 1
connection 1
and 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
our 1
depositors 1
One 1
of 1
our 1
most 1
lucrative 1
means 1
of 1
laying 1
out 1
money 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
loans 1
where 1
the 1
security 1
is 1
unimpeachable 1
We 1
have 1
done 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
in 1
this 1
direction 1
during 1
the 1
last 1
few 1
years 1
and 1
there 1
are 1
many 1
noble 1
families 1
to 1
whom 1
we 1
have 1
advanced 1
large 1
sums 1
upon 1
the 1
security 1
of 1
their 1
pictures 1
libraries 1
or 1
plate 1
Yesterday 1
morning 1
I 1
was 1
seated 1
in 1
my 1
office 1
at 1
the 1
bank 1
when 1
a 1
card 1
was 1
brought 1
in 1
to 1
me 1
by 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
clerks 1
I 1
started 1
when 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
name 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
of 1
none 1
other 1
than 1
well 1
perhaps 1
even 1
to 1
you 1
I 1
had 1
better 1
say 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
name 1
which 1
is 1
a 1
household 1
word 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
earth 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
highest 1
noblest 1
most 1
exalted 1
names 1
in 1
England 1
I 1
was 1
overwhelmed 1
by 1
the 1
honour 1
and 1
attempted 1
when 1
he 1
entered 1
to 1
say 1
so 1
but 1
he 1
plunged 1
at 1
once 1
into 1
business 1
with 1
the 1
air 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
wishes 1
to 1
hurry 1
quickly 1
through 1
a 1
disagreeable 1
task 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
informed 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
in 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
advancing 1
money 1
The 1
firm 1
does 1
so 1
when 1
the 1
security 1
is 1
good 1
I 1
answered 1
It 1
is 1
absolutely 1
essential 1
to 1
me 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
pounds 1
at 1
once 1
I 1
could 1
of 1
course 1
borrow 1
so 1
trifling 1
a 1
sum 1
ten 1
times 1
over 1
from 1
my 1
friends 1
but 1
I 1
much 1
prefer 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
business 1
and 1
to 1
carry 1
out 1
that 1
business 1
myself 1
In 1
my 1
position 1
you 1
can 1
readily 1
understand 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
unwise 1
to 1
place 1
one 1
s 1
self 1
under 1
obligations 1
For 1
how 1
long 1
may 1
I 1
ask 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
this 1
sum 1
I 1
asked 1
Next 1
Monday 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
large 1
sum 1
due 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
shall 1
then 1
most 1
certainly 1
repay 1
what 1
you 1
advance 1
with 1
whatever 1
interest 1
you 1
think 1
it 1
right 1
to 1
charge 1
But 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
essential 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
money 1
should 1
be 1
paid 1
at 1
once 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
happy 1
to 1
advance 1
it 1
without 1
further 1
parley 1
from 1
my 1
own 1
private 1
purse 1
said 1
I 1
were 1
it 1
not 1
that 1
the 1
strain 1
would 1
be 1
rather 1
more 1
than 1
it 1
could 1
bear 1
If 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
I 1
am 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
firm 1
then 1
in 1
justice 1
to 1
my 1
partner 1
I 1
must 1
insist 1
that 1
even 1
in 1
your 1
case 1
every 1
businesslike 1
precaution 1
should 1
be 1
taken 1
I 1
should 1
much 1
prefer 1
to 1
have 1
it 1
so 1
said 1
he 1
raising 1
up 1
a 1
square 1
black 1
morocco 1
case 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
laid 1
beside 1
his 1
chair 1
You 1
have 1
doubtless 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
Beryl 1
Coronet 1
One 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
precious 1
public 1
possessions 1
of 1
the 1
empire 1
said 1
I 1
Precisely 1
He 1
opened 1
the 1
case 1
and 1
there 1
imbedded 1
in 1
soft 1
flesh 1
coloured 1
velvet 1
lay 1
the 1
magnificent 1
piece 1
of 1
jewellery 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
named 1
There 1
are 1
thirty 1
nine 1
enormous 1
beryls 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
the 1
price 1
of 1
the 1
gold 1
chasing 1
is 1
incalculable 1
The 1
lowest 1
estimate 1
would 1
put 1
the 1
worth 1
of 1
the 1
coronet 1
at 1
double 1
the 1
sum 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
asked 1
I 1
am 1
prepared 1
to 1
leave 1
it 1
with 1
you 1
as 1
my 1
security 1
I 1
took 1
the 1
precious 1
case 1
into 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
looked 1
in 1
some 1
perplexity 1
from 1
it 1
to 1
my 1
illustrious 1
client 1
You 1
doubt 1
its 1
value 1
he 1
asked 1
Not 1
at 1
all 1
I 1
only 1
doubt 1
The 1
propriety 1
of 1
my 1
leaving 1
it 1
You 1
may 1
set 1
your 1
mind 1
at 1
rest 1
about 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
dream 1
of 1
doing 1
so 1
were 1
it 1
not 1
absolutely 1
certain 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
able 1
in 1
four 1
days 1
to 1
reclaim 1
it 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
pure 1
matter 1
of 1
form 1
Is 1
the 1
security 1
sufficient 1
Ample 1
You 1
understand 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
giving 1
you 1
a 1
strong 1
proof 1
of 1
the 1
confidence 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
in 1
you 1
founded 1
upon 1
all 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
heard 1
of 1
you 1
I 1
rely 1
upon 1
you 1
not 1
only 1
to 1
be 1
discreet 1
and 1
to 1
refrain 1
from 1
all 1
gossip 1
upon 1
the 1
matter 1
but 1
above 1
all 1
to 1
preserve 1
this 1
coronet 1
with 1
every 1
possible 1
precaution 1
because 1
I 1
need 1
not 1
say 1
that 1
a 1
great 1
public 1
scandal 1
would 1
be 1
caused 1
if 1
any 1
harm 1
were 1
to 1
befall 1
it 1
Any 1
injury 1
to 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
almost 1
as 1
serious 1
as 1
its 1
complete 1
loss 1
for 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
beryls 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
match 1
these 1
and 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
impossible 1
to 1
replace 1
them 1
I 1
leave 1
it 1
with 1
you 1
however 1
with 1
every 1
confidence 1
and 1
I 1
shall 1
call 1
for 1
it 1
in 1
person 1
on 1
Monday 1
morning 1
Seeing 1
that 1
my 1
client 1
was 1
anxious 1
to 1
leave 1
I 1
said 1
no 1
more 1
but 1
calling 1
for 1
my 1
cashier 1
I 1
ordered 1
him 1
to 1
pay 1
over 1
fifty 1
pound 1
notes 1
When 1
I 1
was 1
alone 1
once 1
more 1
however 1
with 1
the 1
precious 1
case 1
lying 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
me 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
but 1
think 1
with 1
some 1
misgivings 1
of 1
the 1
immense 1
responsibility 1
which 1
it 1
entailed 1
upon 1
me 1
There 1
could 1
be 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
national 1
possession 1
a 1
horrible 1
scandal 1
would 1
ensue 1
if 1
any 1
misfortune 1
should 1
occur 1
to 1
it 1
I 1
already 1
regretted 1
having 1
ever 1
consented 1
to 1
take 1
charge 1
of 1
it 1
However 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
late 1
to 1
alter 1
the 1
matter 1
now 1
so 1
I 1
locked 1
it 1
up 1
in 1
my 1
private 1
safe 1
and 1
turned 1
once 1
more 1
to 1
my 1
work 1
When 1
evening 1
came 1
I 1
felt 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
an 1
imprudence 1
to 1
leave 1
so 1
precious 1
a 1
thing 1
in 1
the 1
office 1
behind 1
me 1
Bankers 1
safes 1
had 1
been 1
forced 1
before 1
now 1
and 1
why 1
should 1
not 1
mine 1
be 1
If 1
so 1
how 1
terrible 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
position 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
should 1
find 1
myself 1
I 1
determined 1
therefore 1
that 1
for 1
the 1
next 1
few 1
days 1
I 1
would 1
always 1
carry 1
the 1
case 1
backward 1
and 1
forward 1
with 1
me 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
never 1
be 1
really 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
reach 1
With 1
this 1
intention 1
I 1
called 1
a 1
cab 1
and 1
drove 1
out 1
to 1
my 1
house 1
at 1
Streatham 1
carrying 1
the 1
jewel 1
with 1
me 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
breathe 1
freely 1
until 1
I 1
had 1
taken 1
it 1
upstairs 1
and 1
locked 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
bureau 1
of 1
my 1
dressing 1
room 1
And 1
now 1
a 1
word 1
as 1
to 1
my 1
household 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
for 1
I 1
wish 1
you 1
to 1
thoroughly 1
understand 1
the 1
situation 1
My 1
groom 1
and 1
my 1
page 1
sleep 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
may 1
be 1
set 1
aside 1
altogether 1
I 1
have 1
three 1
maid 1
servants 1
who 1
have 1
been 1
with 1
me 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
years 1
and 1
whose 1
absolute 1
reliability 1
is 1
quite 1
above 1
suspicion 1
Another 1
Lucy 1
Parr 1
the 1
second 1
waiting 1
maid 1
has 1
only 1
been 1
in 1
my 1
service 1
a 1
few 1
months 1
She 1
came 1
with 1
an 1
excellent 1
character 1
however 1
and 1
has 1
always 1
given 1
me 1
satisfaction 1
She 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
pretty 1
girl 1
and 1
has 1
attracted 1
admirers 1
who 1
have 1
occasionally 1
hung 1
about 1
the 1
place 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
drawback 1
which 1
we 1
have 1
found 1
to 1
her 1
but 1
we 1
believe 1
her 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
thoroughly 1
good 1
girl 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
So 1
much 1
for 1
the 1
servants 1
My 1
family 1
itself 1
is 1
so 1
small 1
that 1
it 1
will 1
not 1
take 1
me 1
long 1
to 1
describe 1
it 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
widower 1
and 1
have 1
an 1
only 1
son 1
Arthur 1
He 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
disappointment 1
to 1
me 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
a 1
grievous 1
disappointment 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
myself 1
to 1
blame 1
People 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
spoiled 1
him 1
Very 1
likely 1
I 1
have 1
When 1
my 1
dear 1
wife 1
died 1
I 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
all 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
love 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
smile 1
fade 1
even 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
from 1
his 1
face 1
I 1
have 1
never 1
denied 1
him 1
a 1
wish 1
Perhaps 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
better 1
for 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
had 1
I 1
been 1
sterner 1
but 1
I 1
meant 1
it 1
for 1
the 1
best 1
It 1
was 1
naturally 1
my 1
intention 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
succeed 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
business 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
of 1
a 1
business 1
turn 1
He 1
was 1
wild 1
wayward 1
and 1
to 1
speak 1
the 1
truth 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
trust 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
handling 1
of 1
large 1
sums 1
of 1
money 1
When 1
he 1
was 1
young 1
he 1
became 1
a 1
member 1
of 1
an 1
aristocratic 1
club 1
and 1
there 1
having 1
charming 1
manners 1
he 1
was 1
soon 1
the 1
intimate 1
of 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
men 1
with 1
long 1
purses 1
and 1
expensive 1
habits 1
He 1
learned 1
to 1
play 1
heavily 1
at 1
cards 1
and 1
to 1
squander 1
money 1
on 1
the 1
turf 1
until 1
he 1
had 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
implore 1
me 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
an 1
advance 1
upon 1
his 1
allowance 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
settle 1
his 1
debts 1
of 1
honour 1
He 1
tried 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
to 1
break 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
dangerous 1
company 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
keeping 1
but 1
each 1
time 1
the 1
influence 1
of 1
his 1
friend 1
Sir 1
George 1
Burnwell 1
was 1
enough 1
to 1
draw 1
him 1
back 1
again 1
And 1
indeed 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
wonder 1
that 1
such 1
a 1
man 1
as 1
Sir 1
George 1
Burnwell 1
should 1
gain 1
an 1
influence 1
over 1
him 1
for 1
he 1
has 1
frequently 1
brought 1
him 1
to 1
my 1
house 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
found 1
myself 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
hardly 1
resist 1
the 1
fascination 1
of 1
his 1
manner 1
He 1
is 1
older 1
than 1
Arthur 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
his 1
finger 1
tips 1
one 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
everywhere 1
seen 1
everything 1
a 1
brilliant 1
talker 1
and 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
great 1
personal 1
beauty 1
Yet 1
when 1
I 1
think 1
of 1
him 1
in 1
cold 1
blood 1
far 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
glamour 1
of 1
his 1
presence 1
I 1
am 1
convinced 1
from 1
his 1
cynical 1
speech 1
and 1
the 1
look 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
caught 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
one 1
who 1
should 1
be 1
deeply 1
distrusted 1
So 1
I 1
think 1
and 1
so 1
too 1
thinks 1
my 1
little 1
Mary 1
who 1
has 1
a 1
woman 1
s 1
quick 1
insight 1
into 1
character 1
And 1
now 1
there 1
is 1
only 1
she 1
to 1
be 1
described 1
She 1
is 1
my 1
niece 1
but 1
when 1
my 1
brother 1
died 1
five 1
years 1
ago 1
and 1
left 1
her 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
I 1
adopted 1
her 1
and 1
have 1
looked 1
upon 1
her 1
ever 1
since 1
as 1
my 1
daughter 1
She 1
is 1
a 1
sunbeam 1
in 1
my 1
house 1
sweet 1
loving 1
beautiful 1
a 1
wonderful 1
manager 1
and 1
housekeeper 1
yet 1
as 1
tender 1
and 1
quiet 1
and 1
gentle 1
as 1
a 1
woman 1
could 1
be 1
She 1
is 1
my 1
right 1
hand 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
could 1
do 1
without 1
her 1
In 1
only 1
one 1
matter 1
has 1
she 1
ever 1
gone 1
against 1
my 1
wishes 1
Twice 1
my 1
boy 1
has 1
asked 1
her 1
to 1
marry 1
him 1
for 1
he 1
loves 1
her 1
devotedly 1
but 1
each 1
time 1
she 1
has 1
refused 1
him 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
if 1
anyone 1
could 1
have 1
drawn 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
right 1
path 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
she 1
and 1
that 1
his 1
marriage 1
might 1
have 1
changed 1
his 1
whole 1
life 1
but 1
now 1
alas 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
late 1
forever 1
too 1
late 1
Now 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
you 1
know 1
the 1
people 1
who 1
live 1
under 1
my 1
roof 1
and 1
I 1
shall 1
continue 1
with 1
my 1
miserable 1
story 1
When 1
we 1
were 1
taking 1
coffee 1
in 1
the 1
drawing 1
room 1
that 1
night 1
after 1
dinner 1
I 1
told 1
Arthur 1
and 1
Mary 1
my 1
experience 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
precious 1
treasure 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
under 1
our 1
roof 1
suppressing 1
only 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
my 1
client 1
Lucy 1
Parr 1
who 1
had 1
brought 1
in 1
the 1
coffee 1
had 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
but 1
I 1
cannot 1
swear 1
that 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
closed 1
Mary 1
and 1
Arthur 1
were 1
much 1
interested 1
and 1
wished 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
famous 1
coronet 1
but 1
I 1
thought 1
it 1
better 1
not 1
to 1
disturb 1
it 1
Where 1
have 1
you 1
put 1
it 1
asked 1
Arthur 1
In 1
my 1
own 1
bureau 1
Well 1
I 1
hope 1
to 1
goodness 1
the 1
house 1
won 1
t 1
be 1
burgled 1
during 1
the 1
night 1
said 1
he 1
It 1
is 1
locked 1
up 1
I 1
answered 1
Oh 1
any 1
old 1
key 1
will 1
fit 1
that 1
bureau 1
When 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
youngster 1
I 1
have 1
opened 1
it 1
myself 1
with 1
the 1
key 1
of 1
the 1
box 1
room 1
cupboard 1
He 1
often 1
had 1
a 1
wild 1
way 1
of 1
talking 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
thought 1
little 1
of 1
what 1
he 1
said 1
He 1
followed 1
me 1
to 1
my 1
room 1
however 1
that 1
night 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
grave 1
face 1
Look 1
here 1
dad 1
said 1
he 1
with 1
his 1
eyes 1
cast 1
down 1
can 1
you 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
pounds 1
No 1
I 1
cannot 1
I 1
answered 1
sharply 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
far 1
too 1
generous 1
with 1
you 1
in 1
money 1
matters 1
You 1
have 1
been 1
very 1
kind 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
I 1
must 1
have 1
this 1
money 1
or 1
else 1
I 1
can 1
never 1
show 1
my 1
face 1
inside 1
the 1
club 1
again 1
And 1
a 1
very 1
good 1
thing 1
too 1
I 1
cried 1
Yes 1
but 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
me 1
leave 1
it 1
a 1
dishonoured 1
man 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
the 1
disgrace 1
I 1
must 1
raise 1
the 1
money 1
in 1
some 1
way 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
it 1
then 1
I 1
must 1
try 1
other 1
means 1
I 1
was 1
very 1
angry 1
for 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
third 1
demand 1
during 1
the 1
month 1
You 1
shall 1
not 1
have 1
a 1
farthing 1
from 1
me 1
I 1
cried 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
bowed 1
and 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
without 1
another 1
word 1
When 1
he 1
was 1
gone 1
I 1
unlocked 1
my 1
bureau 1
made 1
sure 1
that 1
my 1
treasure 1
was 1
safe 1
and 1
locked 1
it 1
again 1
Then 1
I 1
started 1
to 1
go 1
round 1
the 1
house 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
all 1
was 1
secure 1
a 1
duty 1
which 1
I 1
usually 1
leave 1
to 1
Mary 1
but 1
which 1
I 1
thought 1
it 1
well 1
to 1
perform 1
myself 1
that 1
night 1
As 1
I 1
came 1
down 1
the 1
stairs 1
I 1
saw 1
Mary 1
herself 1
at 1
the 1
side 1
window 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
which 1
she 1
closed 1
and 1
fastened 1
as 1
I 1
approached 1
Tell 1
me 1
dad 1
said 1
she 1
looking 1
I 1
thought 1
a 1
little 1
disturbed 1
did 1
you 1
give 1
Lucy 1
the 1
maid 1
leave 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
to 1
night 1
Certainly 1
not 1
She 1
came 1
in 1
just 1
now 1
by 1
the 1
back 1
door 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
she 1
has 1
only 1
been 1
to 1
the 1
side 1
gate 1
to 1
see 1
someone 1
but 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
hardly 1
safe 1
and 1
should 1
be 1
stopped 1
You 1
must 1
speak 1
to 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
or 1
I 1
will 1
if 1
you 1
prefer 1
it 1
Are 1
you 1
sure 1
that 1
everything 1
is 1
fastened 1
Quite 1
sure 1
dad 1
Then 1
good 1
night 1
I 1
kissed 1
her 1
and 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
my 1
bedroom 1
again 1
where 1
I 1
was 1
soon 1
asleep 1
I 1
am 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
everything 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
which 1
may 1
have 1
any 1
bearing 1
upon 1
the 1
case 1
but 1
I 1
beg 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
question 1
me 1
upon 1
any 1
point 1
which 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
make 1
clear 1
On 1
the 1
contrary 1
your 1
statement 1
is 1
singularly 1
lucid 1
I 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
story 1
now 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
should 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
particularly 1
so 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
a 1
very 1
heavy 1
sleeper 1
and 1
the 1
anxiety 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
tended 1
no 1
doubt 1
to 1
make 1
me 1
even 1
less 1
so 1
than 1
usual 1
About 1
two 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
then 1
I 1
was 1
awakened 1
by 1
some 1
sound 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
It 1
had 1
ceased 1
ere 1
I 1
was 1
wide 1
awake 1
but 1
it 1
had 1
left 1
an 1
impression 1
behind 1
it 1
as 1
though 1
a 1
window 1
had 1
gently 1
closed 1
somewhere 1
I 1
lay 1
listening 1
with 1
all 1
my 1
ears 1
Suddenly 1
to 1
my 1
horror 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
distinct 1
sound 1
of 1
footsteps 1
moving 1
softly 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
I 1
slipped 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
all 1
palpitating 1
with 1
fear 1
and 1
peeped 1
round 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
my 1
dressing 1
room 1
door 1
Arthur 1
I 1
screamed 1
you 1
villain 1
you 1
thief 1
How 1
dare 1
you 1
touch 1
that 1
coronet 1
The 1
gas 1
was 1
half 1
up 1
as 1
I 1
had 1
left 1
it 1
and 1
my 1
unhappy 1
boy 1
dressed 1
only 1
in 1
his 1
shirt 1
and 1
trousers 1
was 1
standing 1
beside 1
the 1
light 1
holding 1
the 1
coronet 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
He 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
wrenching 1
at 1
it 1
or 1
bending 1
it 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
strength 1
At 1
my 1
cry 1
he 1
dropped 1
it 1
from 1
his 1
grasp 1
and 1
turned 1
as 1
pale 1
as 1
death 1
I 1
snatched 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
examined 1
it 1
One 1
of 1
the 1
gold 1
corners 1
with 1
three 1
of 1
the 1
beryls 1
in 1
it 1
was 1
missing 1
You 1
blackguard 1
I 1
shouted 1
beside 1
myself 1
with 1
rage 1
You 1
have 1
destroyed 1
it 1
You 1
have 1
dishonoured 1
me 1
forever 1
Where 1
are 1
the 1
jewels 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
stolen 1
Stolen 1
he 1
cried 1
Yes 1
thief 1
I 1
roared 1
shaking 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
shoulder 1
There 1
are 1
none 1
missing 1
There 1
cannot 1
be 1
any 1
missing 1
said 1
he 1
There 1
are 1
three 1
missing 1
And 1
you 1
know 1
where 1
they 1
are 1
Must 1
I 1
call 1
you 1
a 1
liar 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
a 1
thief 1
Did 1
I 1
not 1
see 1
you 1
trying 1
to 1
tear 1
off 1
another 1
piece 1
You 1
have 1
called 1
me 1
names 1
enough 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
stand 1
it 1
any 1
longer 1
I 1
shall 1
not 1
say 1
another 1
word 1
about 1
this 1
business 1
since 1
you 1
have 1
chosen 1
to 1
insult 1
me 1
I 1
will 1
leave 1
your 1
house 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
make 1
my 1
own 1
way 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
You 1
shall 1
leave 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
the 1
police 1
I 1
cried 1
half 1
mad 1
with 1
grief 1
and 1
rage 1
I 1
shall 1
have 1
this 1
matter 1
probed 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
You 1
shall 1
learn 1
nothing 1
from 1
me 1
said 1
he 1
with 1
a 1
passion 1
such 1
as 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
have 1
thought 1
was 1
in 1
his 1
nature 1
If 1
you 1
choose 1
to 1
call 1
the 1
police 1
let 1
the 1
police 1
find 1
what 1
they 1
can 1
By 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
whole 1
house 1
was 1
astir 1
for 1
I 1
had 1
raised 1
my 1
voice 1
in 1
my 1
anger 1
Mary 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
to 1
rush 1
into 1
my 1
room 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
coronet 1
and 1
of 1
Arthur 1
s 1
face 1
she 1
read 1
the 1
whole 1
story 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
scream 1
fell 1
down 1
senseless 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
I 1
sent 1
the 1
house 1
maid 1
for 1
the 1
police 1
and 1
put 1
the 1
investigation 1
into 1
their 1
hands 1
at 1
once 1
When 1
the 1
inspector 1
and 1
a 1
constable 1
entered 1
the 1
house 1
Arthur 1
who 1
had 1
stood 1
sullenly 1
with 1
his 1
arms 1
folded 1
asked 1
me 1
whether 1
it 1
was 1
my 1
intention 1
to 1
charge 1
him 1
with 1
theft 1
I 1
answered 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
private 1
matter 1
but 1
had 1
become 1
a 1
public 1
one 1
since 1
the 1
ruined 1
coronet 1
was 1
national 1
property 1
I 1
was 1
determined 1
that 1
the 1
law 1
should 1
have 1
its 1
way 1
in 1
everything 1
At 1
least 1
said 1
he 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
have 1
me 1
arrested 1
at 1
once 1
It 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
your 1
advantage 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
mine 1
if 1
I 1
might 1
leave 1
the 1
house 1
for 1
five 1
minutes 1
That 1
you 1
may 1
get 1
away 1
or 1
perhaps 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
conceal 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
stolen 1
said 1
I 1
And 1
then 1
realising 1
the 1
dreadful 1
position 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
placed 1
I 1
implored 1
him 1
to 1
remember 1
that 1
not 1
only 1
my 1
honour 1
but 1
that 1
of 1
one 1
who 1
was 1
far 1
greater 1
than 1
I 1
was 1
at 1
stake 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
threatened 1
to 1
raise 1
a 1
scandal 1
which 1
would 1
convulse 1
the 1
nation 1
He 1
might 1
avert 1
it 1
all 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
but 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
with 1
the 1
three 1
missing 1
stones 1
You 1
may 1
as 1
well 1
face 1
the 1
matter 1
said 1
I 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
caught 1
in 1
the 1
act 1
and 1
no 1
confession 1
could 1
make 1
your 1
guilt 1
more 1
heinous 1
If 1
you 1
but 1
make 1
such 1
reparation 1
as 1
is 1
in 1
your 1
power 1
by 1
telling 1
us 1
where 1
the 1
beryls 1
are 1
all 1
shall 1
be 1
forgiven 1
and 1
forgotten 1
Keep 1
your 1
forgiveness 1
for 1
those 1
who 1
ask 1
for 1
it 1
he 1
answered 1
turning 1
away 1
from 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
sneer 1
I 1
saw 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
too 1
hardened 1
for 1
any 1
words 1
of 1
mine 1
to 1
influence 1
him 1
There 1
was 1
but 1
one 1
way 1
for 1
it 1
I 1
called 1
in 1
the 1
inspector 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
into 1
custody 1
A 1
search 1
was 1
made 1
at 1
once 1
not 1
only 1
of 1
his 1
person 1
but 1
of 1
his 1
room 1
and 1
of 1
every 1
portion 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
where 1
he 1
could 1
possibly 1
have 1
concealed 1
the 1
gems 1
but 1
no 1
trace 1
of 1
them 1
could 1
be 1
found 1
nor 1
would 1
the 1
wretched 1
boy 1
open 1
his 1
mouth 1
for 1
all 1
our 1
persuasions 1
and 1
our 1
threats 1
This 1
morning 1
he 1
was 1
removed 1
to 1
a 1
cell 1
and 1
I 1
after 1
going 1
through 1
all 1
the 1
police 1
formalities 1
have 1
hurried 1
round 1
to 1
you 1
to 1
implore 1
you 1
to 1
use 1
your 1
skill 1
in 1
unravelling 1
the 1
matter 1
The 1
police 1
have 1
openly 1
confessed 1
that 1
they 1
can 1
at 1
present 1
make 1
nothing 1
of 1
it 1
You 1
may 1
go 1
to 1
any 1
expense 1
which 1
you 1
think 1
necessary 1
I 1
have 1
already 1
offered 1
a 1
reward 1
of 1
pounds 1
My 1
God 1
what 1
shall 1
I 1
do 1
I 1
have 1
lost 1
my 1
honour 1
my 1
gems 1
and 1
my 1
son 1
in 1
one 1
night 1
Oh 1
what 1
shall 1
I 1
do 1
He 1
put 1
a 1
hand 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
rocked 1
himself 1
to 1
and 1
fro 1
droning 1
to 1
himself 1
like 1
a 1
child 1
whose 1
grief 1
has 1
got 1
beyond 1
words 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
sat 1
silent 1
for 1
some 1
few 1
minutes 1
with 1
his 1
brows 1
knitted 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
upon 1
the 1
fire 1
Do 1
you 1
receive 1
much 1
company 1
he 1
asked 1
None 1
save 1
my 1
partner 1
with 1
his 1
family 1
and 1
an 1
occasional 1
friend 1
of 1
Arthur 1
s 1
Sir 1
George 1
Burnwell 1
has 1
been 1
several 1
times 1
lately 1
No 1
one 1
else 1
I 1
think 1
Do 1
you 1
go 1
out 1
much 1
in 1
society 1
Arthur 1
does 1
Mary 1
and 1
I 1
stay 1
at 1
home 1
We 1
neither 1
of 1
us 1
care 1
for 1
it 1
That 1
is 1
unusual 1
in 1
a 1
young 1
girl 1
She 1
is 1
of 1
a 1
quiet 1
nature 1
Besides 1
she 1
is 1
not 1
so 1
very 1
young 1
She 1
is 1
four 1
and 1
twenty 1
This 1
matter 1
from 1
what 1
you 1
say 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
shock 1
to 1
her 1
also 1
Terrible 1
She 1
is 1
even 1
more 1
affected 1
than 1
I 1
You 1
have 1
neither 1
of 1
you 1
any 1
doubt 1
as 1
to 1
your 1
son 1
s 1
guilt 1
How 1
can 1
we 1
have 1
when 1
I 1
saw 1
him 1
with 1
my 1
own 1
eyes 1
with 1
the 1
coronet 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
I 1
hardly 1
consider 1
that 1
a 1
conclusive 1
proof 1
Was 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
the 1
coronet 1
at 1
all 1
injured 1
Yes 1
it 1
was 1
twisted 1
Do 1
you 1
not 1
think 1
then 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
trying 1
to 1
straighten 1
it 1
God 1
bless 1
you 1
You 1
are 1
doing 1
what 1
you 1
can 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
for 1
me 1
But 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
heavy 1
a 1
task 1
What 1
was 1
he 1
doing 1
there 1
at 1
all 1
If 1
his 1
purpose 1
were 1
innocent 1
why 1
did 1
he 1
not 1
say 1
so 1
Precisely 1
And 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
guilty 1
why 1
did 1
he 1
not 1
invent 1
a 1
lie 1
His 1
silence 1
appears 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
cut 1
both 1
ways 1
There 1
are 1
several 1
singular 1
points 1
about 1
the 1
case 1
What 1
did 1
the 1
police 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
noise 1
which 1
awoke 1
you 1
from 1
your 1
sleep 1
They 1
considered 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
caused 1
by 1
Arthur 1
s 1
closing 1
his 1
bedroom 1
door 1
A 1
likely 1
story 1
As 1
if 1
a 1
man 1
bent 1
on 1
felony 1
would 1
slam 1
his 1
door 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
wake 1
a 1
household 1
What 1
did 1
they 1
say 1
then 1
of 1
the 1
disappearance 1
of 1
these 1
gems 1
They 1
are 1
still 1
sounding 1
the 1
planking 1
and 1
probing 1
the 1
furniture 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
finding 1
them 1
Have 1
they 1
thought 1
of 1
looking 1
outside 1
the 1
house 1
Yes 1
they 1
have 1
shown 1
extraordinary 1
energy 1
The 1
whole 1
garden 1
has 1
already 1
been 1
minutely 1
examined 1
Now 1
my 1
dear 1
sir 1
said 1
Holmes 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
obvious 1
to 1
you 1
now 1
that 1
this 1
matter 1
really 1
strikes 1
very 1
much 1
deeper 1
than 1
either 1
you 1
or 1
the 1
police 1
were 1
at 1
first 1
inclined 1
to 1
think 1
It 1
appeared 1
to 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
simple 1
case 1
to 1
me 1
it 1
seems 1
exceedingly 1
complex 1
Consider 1
what 1
is 1
involved 1
by 1
your 1
theory 1
You 1
suppose 1
that 1
your 1
son 1
came 1
down 1
from 1
his 1
bed 1
went 1
at 1
great 1
risk 1
to 1
your 1
dressing 1
room 1
opened 1
your 1
bureau 1
took 1
out 1
your 1
coronet 1
broke 1
off 1
by 1
main 1
force 1
a 1
small 1
portion 1
of 1
it 1
went 1
off 1
to 1
some 1
other 1
place 1
concealed 1
three 1
gems 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
thirty 1
nine 1
with 1
such 1
skill 1
that 1
nobody 1
can 1
find 1
them 1
and 1
then 1
returned 1
with 1
the 1
other 1
thirty 1
six 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
exposed 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
greatest 1
danger 1
of 1
being 1
discovered 1
I 1
ask 1
you 1
now 1
is 1
such 1
a 1
theory 1
tenable 1
But 1
what 1
other 1
is 1
there 1
cried 1
the 1
banker 1
with 1
a 1
gesture 1
of 1
despair 1
If 1
his 1
motives 1
were 1
innocent 1
why 1
does 1
he 1
not 1
explain 1
them 1
It 1
is 1
our 1
task 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
out 1
replied 1
Holmes 1
so 1
now 1
if 1
you 1
please 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
we 1
will 1
set 1
off 1
for 1
Streatham 1
together 1
and 1
devote 1
an 1
hour 1
to 1
glancing 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
closely 1
into 1
details 1
My 1
friend 1
insisted 1
upon 1
my 1
accompanying 1
them 1
in 1
their 1
expedition 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
eager 1
enough 1
to 1
do 1
for 1
my 1
curiosity 1
and 1
sympathy 1
were 1
deeply 1
stirred 1
by 1
the 1
story 1
to 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
listened 1
I 1
confess 1
that 1
the 1
guilt 1
of 1
the 1
banker 1
s 1
son 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
as 1
obvious 1
as 1
it 1
did 1
to 1
his 1
unhappy 1
father 1
but 1
still 1
I 1
had 1
such 1
faith 1
in 1
Holmes 1
judgment 1
that 1
I 1
felt 1
that 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
some 1
grounds 1
for 1
hope 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
dissatisfied 1
with 1
the 1
accepted 1
explanation 1
He 1
hardly 1
spoke 1
a 1
word 1
the 1
whole 1
way 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
southern 1
suburb 1
but 1
sat 1
with 1
his 1
chin 1
upon 1
his 1
breast 1
and 1
his 1
hat 1
drawn 1
over 1
his 1
eyes 1
sunk 1
in 1
the 1
deepest 1
thought 1
Our 1
client 1
appeared 1
to 1
have 1
taken 1
fresh 1
heart 1
at 1
the 1
little 1
glimpse 1
of 1
hope 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
presented 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
even 1
broke 1
into 1
a 1
desultory 1
chat 1
with 1
me 1
over 1
his 1
business 1
affairs 1
A 1
short 1
railway 1
journey 1
and 1
a 1
shorter 1
walk 1
brought 1
us 1
to 1
Fairbank 1
the 1
modest 1
residence 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
financier 1
Fairbank 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
sized 1
square 1
house 1
of 1
white 1
stone 1
standing 1
back 1
a 1
little 1
from 1
the 1
road 1
A 1
double 1
carriage 1
sweep 1
with 1
a 1
snow 1
clad 1
lawn 1
stretched 1
down 1
in 1
front 1
to 1
two 1
large 1
iron 1
gates 1
which 1
closed 1
the 1
entrance 1
On 1
the 1
right 1
side 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
wooden 1
thicket 1
which 1
led 1
into 1
a 1
narrow 1
path 1
between 1
two 1
neat 1
hedges 1
stretching 1
from 1
the 1
road 1
to 1
the 1
kitchen 1
door 1
and 1
forming 1
the 1
tradesmen 1
s 1
entrance 1
On 1
the 1
left 1
ran 1
a 1
lane 1
which 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
stables 1
and 1
was 1
not 1
itself 1
within 1
the 1
grounds 1
at 1
all 1
being 1
a 1
public 1
though 1
little 1
used 1
thoroughfare 1
Holmes 1
left 1
us 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
walked 1
slowly 1
all 1
round 1
the 1
house 1
across 1
the 1
front 1
down 1
the 1
tradesmen 1
s 1
path 1
and 1
so 1
round 1
by 1
the 1
garden 1
behind 1
into 1
the 1
stable 1
lane 1
So 1
long 1
was 1
he 1
that 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
and 1
I 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
dining 1
room 1
and 1
waited 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
until 1
he 1
should 1
return 1
We 1
were 1
sitting 1
there 1
in 1
silence 1
when 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
came 1
in 1
She 1
was 1
rather 1
above 1
the 1
middle 1
height 1
slim 1
with 1
dark 1
hair 1
and 1
eyes 1
which 1
seemed 1
the 1
darker 1
against 1
the 1
absolute 1
pallor 1
of 1
her 1
skin 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
seen 1
such 1
deadly 1
paleness 1
in 1
a 1
woman 1
s 1
face 1
Her 1
lips 1
too 1
were 1
bloodless 1
but 1
her 1
eyes 1
were 1
flushed 1
with 1
crying 1
As 1
she 1
swept 1
silently 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
she 1
impressed 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
greater 1
sense 1
of 1
grief 1
than 1
the 1
banker 1
had 1
done 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
more 1
striking 1
in 1
her 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
evidently 1
a 1
woman 1
of 1
strong 1
character 1
with 1
immense 1
capacity 1
for 1
self 1
restraint 1
Disregarding 1
my 1
presence 1
she 1
went 1
straight 1
to 1
her 1
uncle 1
and 1
passed 1
her 1
hand 1
over 1
his 1
head 1
with 1
a 1
sweet 1
womanly 1
caress 1
You 1
have 1
given 1
orders 1
that 1
Arthur 1
should 1
be 1
liberated 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
dad 1
she 1
asked 1
No 1
no 1
my 1
girl 1
the 1
matter 1
must 1
be 1
probed 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
But 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
sure 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
innocent 1
You 1
know 1
what 1
woman 1
s 1
instincts 1
are 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
done 1
no 1
harm 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
sorry 1
for 1
having 1
acted 1
so 1
harshly 1
Why 1
is 1
he 1
silent 1
then 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
innocent 1
Who 1
knows 1
Perhaps 1
because 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
angry 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
suspect 1
him 1
How 1
could 1
I 1
help 1
suspecting 1
him 1
when 1
I 1
actually 1
saw 1
him 1
with 1
the 1
coronet 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
Oh 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
only 1
picked 1
it 1
up 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
Oh 1
do 2
take 1
my 1
word 1
for 1
it 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
innocent 1
Let 1
the 1
matter 1
drop 1
and 1
say 1
no 1
more 1
It 1
is 1
so 1
dreadful 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
our 1
dear 1
Arthur 1
in 1
prison 1
I 1
shall 1
never 1
let 1
it 1
drop 1
until 1
the 1
gems 1
are 1
found 1
never 1
Mary 1
Your 1
affection 1
for 1
Arthur 1
blinds 1
you 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
awful 1
consequences 1
to 1
me 1
Far 1
from 1
hushing 1
the 1
thing 1
up 1
I 1
have 1
brought 1
a 1
gentleman 1
down 1
from 1
London 1
to 1
inquire 1
more 1
deeply 1
into 1
it 1
This 1
gentleman 1
she 1
asked 1
facing 1
round 1
to 1
me 1
No 1
his 1
friend 1
He 1
wished 1
us 1
to 1
leave 1
him 1
alone 1
He 1
is 1
round 1
in 1
the 1
stable 1
lane 1
now 1
The 1
stable 1
lane 1
She 1
raised 1
her 1
dark 1
eyebrows 1
What 1
can 1
he 1
hope 1
to 1
find 1
there 1
Ah 1
this 1
I 1
suppose 1
is 1
he 1
I 1
trust 1
sir 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
succeed 1
in 1
proving 1
what 1
I 1
feel 1
sure 1
is 1
the 1
truth 1
that 1
my 1
cousin 1
Arthur 1
is 1
innocent 1
of 1
this 1
crime 1
I 1
fully 1
share 1
your 1
opinion 1
and 1
I 1
trust 1
with 1
you 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
prove 1
it 1
returned 1
Holmes 1
going 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
mat 1
to 1
knock 1
the 1
snow 1
from 1
his 1
shoes 1
I 1
believe 1
I 1
have 1
the 1
honour 1
of 1
addressing 1
Miss 1
Mary 1
Holder 1
Might 1
I 1
ask 1
you 1
a 1
question 1
or 1
two 1
Pray 1
do 1
sir 1
if 1
it 1
may 1
help 1
to 1
clear 1
this 1
horrible 1
affair 1
up 1
You 1
heard 1
nothing 1
yourself 1
last 1
night 1
Nothing 1
until 1
my 1
uncle 1
here 1
began 1
to 1
speak 1
loudly 1
I 1
heard 1
that 1
and 1
I 1
came 1
down 1
You 1
shut 1
up 1
the 1
windows 1
and 1
doors 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
Did 1
you 1
fasten 1
all 1
the 1
windows 1
Yes 1
Were 1
they 1
all 1
fastened 1
this 1
morning 1
Yes 1
You 1
have 1
a 1
maid 1
who 1
has 1
a 1
sweetheart 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
you 1
remarked 1
to 1
your 1
uncle 1
last 1
night 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
out 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
Yes 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
the 1
girl 1
who 1
waited 1
in 1
the 1
drawing 1
room 1
and 1
who 1
may 1
have 1
heard 1
uncle 1
s 1
remarks 1
about 1
the 1
coronet 1
I 1
see 1
You 1
infer 1
that 1
she 1
may 1
have 1
gone 1
out 1
to 1
tell 1
her 1
sweetheart 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
two 1
may 1
have 1
planned 1
the 1
robbery 1
But 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
good 1
of 1
all 1
these 1
vague 1
theories 1
cried 1
the 1
banker 1
impatiently 1
when 1
I 1
have 1
told 1
you 1
that 1
I 1
saw 1
Arthur 1
with 1
the 1
coronet 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
Wait 1
a 1
little 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
We 1
must 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
that 1
About 1
this 1
girl 1
Miss 1
Holder 1
You 1
saw 1
her 1
return 1
by 1
the 1
kitchen 1
door 1
I 1
presume 1
Yes 1
when 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
fastened 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
I 1
met 1
her 1
slipping 1
in 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
man 1
too 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
Do 1
you 1
know 1
him 1
Oh 1
yes 1
he 1
is 1
the 1
green 1
grocer 1
who 1
brings 1
our 1
vegetables 1
round 1
His 1
name 1
is 1
Francis 1
Prosper 1
He 1
stood 1
said 1
Holmes 1
to 1
the 1
left 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
that 1
is 1
to 1
say 1
farther 1
up 1
the 1
path 1
than 1
is 1
necessary 1
to 1
reach 1
the 1
door 1
Yes 1
he 1
did 1
And 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
wooden 1
leg 1
Something 1
like 1
fear 1
sprang 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
s 1
expressive 1
black 1
eyes 1
Why 1
you 1
are 1
like 1
a 1
magician 1
said 1
she 1
How 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
that 1
She 1
smiled 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
answering 1
smile 1
in 1
Holmes 1
thin 1
eager 1
face 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
very 1
glad 1
now 1
to 1
go 1
upstairs 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
shall 1
probably 1
wish 1
to 1
go 1
over 1
the 1
outside 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
again 1
Perhaps 1
I 1
had 1
better 1
take 1
a 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
lower 1
windows 1
before 1
I 1
go 1
up 1
He 1
walked 1
swiftly 1
round 1
from 1
one 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
pausing 1
only 1
at 1
the 1
large 1
one 1
which 1
looked 1
from 1
the 1
hall 1
onto 1
the 1
stable 1
lane 1
This 1
he 1
opened 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
very 1
careful 1
examination 1
of 1
the 1
sill 1
with 1
his 1
powerful 1
magnifying 1
lens 1
Now 1
we 1
shall 1
go 1
upstairs 1
said 1
he 1
at 1
last 1
The 1
banker 1
s 1
dressing 1
room 1
was 1
a 1
plainly 1
furnished 1
little 1
chamber 1
with 1
a 1
grey 1
carpet 1
a 1
large 1
bureau 1
and 1
a 1
long 1
mirror 1
Holmes 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
bureau 1
first 1
and 1
looked 1
hard 1
at 1
the 1
lock 1
Which 1
key 1
was 1
used 1
to 1
open 1
it 1
he 1
asked 1
That 1
which 1
my 1
son 1
himself 1
indicated 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
cupboard 1
of 1
the 1
lumber 1
room 1
Have 1
you 1
it 1
here 1
That 1
is 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
dressing 1
table 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
bureau 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
noiseless 1
lock 1
said 1
he 1
It 1
is 1
no 1
wonder 1
that 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
wake 1
you 1
This 1
case 1
I 1
presume 1
contains 1
the 1
coronet 1
We 1
must 1
have 1
a 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
He 1
opened 1
the 1
case 1
and 1
taking 1
out 1
the 1
diadem 1
he 1
laid 1
it 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
magnificent 1
specimen 1
of 1
the 1
jeweller 1
s 1
art 1
and 1
the 1
thirty 1
six 1
stones 1
were 1
the 1
finest 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
seen 1
At 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
coronet 1
was 1
a 1
cracked 1
edge 1
where 1
a 1
corner 1
holding 1
three 1
gems 1
had 1
been 1
torn 1
away 1
Now 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
said 1
Holmes 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
corner 1
which 1
corresponds 1
to 1
that 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
so 1
unfortunately 1
lost 1
Might 1
I 1
beg 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
break 1
it 1
off 1
The 1
banker 1
recoiled 1
in 1
horror 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
dream 1
of 1
trying 1
said 1
he 1
Then 1
I 1
will 1
Holmes 1
suddenly 1
bent 1
his 1
strength 1
upon 1
it 1
but 1
without 1
result 1
I 1
feel 1
it 1
give 1
a 1
little 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
though 1
I 1
am 1
exceptionally 1
strong 1
in 1
the 1
fingers 1
it 1
would 1
take 1
me 1
all 1
my 1
time 1
to 1
break 1
it 1
An 1
ordinary 1
man 1
could 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
Now 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
would 1
happen 1
if 1
I 1
did 1
break 1
it 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
There 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
noise 1
like 1
a 1
pistol 1
shot 1
Do 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
all 1
this 1
happened 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
yards 1
of 1
your 1
bed 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
heard 1
nothing 1
of 1
it 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
think 1
It 1
is 1
all 1
dark 1
to 1
me 1
But 1
perhaps 1
it 1
may 1
grow 1
lighter 1
as 1
we 1
go 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
Miss 1
Holder 1
I 1
confess 1
that 1
I 1
still 1
share 1
my 1
uncle 1
s 1
perplexity 1
Your 1
son 1
had 1
no 1
shoes 1
or 1
slippers 1
on 1
when 1
you 1
saw 1
him 1
He 1
had 1
nothing 1
on 1
save 1
only 1
his 1
trousers 1
and 1
shirt 1
Thank 1
you 1
We 1
have 1
certainly 1
been 1
favoured 1
with 1
extraordinary 1
luck 1
during 1
this 1
inquiry 1
and 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
entirely 1
our 1
own 1
fault 1
if 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
succeed 1
in 1
clearing 1
the 1
matter 1
up 1
With 1
your 1
permission 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
I 1
shall 1
now 1
continue 1
my 1
investigations 1
outside 1
He 1
went 1
alone 1
at 1
his 1
own 1
request 1
for 1
he 1
explained 1
that 1
any 1
unnecessary 1
footmarks 1
might 1
make 1
his 1
task 1
more 1
difficult 1
For 1
an 1
hour 1
or 1
more 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
work 1
returning 1
at 1
last 1
with 1
his 1
feet 1
heavy 1
with 1
snow 1
and 1
his 1
features 1
as 1
inscrutable 1
as 1
ever 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
now 1
all 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
to 1
see 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
can 1
serve 1
you 1
best 1
by 1
returning 1
to 1
my 1
rooms 1
But 1
the 1
gems 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
Where 1
are 1
they 1
I 1
cannot 1
tell 1
The 1
banker 1
wrung 1
his 1
hands 1
I 1
shall 1
never 1
see 1
them 1
again 1
he 1
cried 1
And 1
my 1
son 1
You 1
give 1
me 1
hopes 1
My 1
opinion 1
is 1
in 1
no 1
way 1
altered 1
Then 1
for 1
God 1
s 1
sake 1
what 1
was 1
this 1
dark 1
business 1
which 1
was 1
acted 1
in 1
my 1
house 1
last 1
night 1
If 1
you 1
can 1
call 1
upon 1
me 1
at 1
my 1
Baker 1
Street 1
rooms 1
to 1
morrow 1
morning 1
between 1
nine 1
and 1
ten 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
happy 1
to 1
do 1
what 1
I 1
can 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
clearer 1
I 1
understand 1
that 1
you 1
give 1
me 1
carte 1
blanche 1
to 1
act 1
for 1
you 1
provided 1
only 1
that 1
I 1
get 1
back 1
the 1
gems 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
place 1
no 1
limit 1
on 1
the 1
sum 1
I 1
may 1
draw 1
I 1
would 1
give 1
my 1
fortune 1
to 1
have 1
them 1
back 1
Very 1
good 1
I 1
shall 1
look 1
into 1
the 1
matter 1
between 1
this 1
and 1
then 1
Good 1
bye 1
it 1
is 1
just 1
possible 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
have 1
to 1
come 1
over 1
here 1
again 1
before 1
evening 1
It 1
was 1
obvious 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
my 1
companion 1
s 1
mind 1
was 1
now 1
made 1
up 1
about 1
the 1
case 1
although 1
what 1
his 1
conclusions 1
were 1
was 1
more 1
than 1
I 1
could 1
even 1
dimly 1
imagine 1
Several 1
times 1
during 1
our 1
homeward 1
journey 1
I 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
sound 1
him 1
upon 1
the 1
point 1
but 1
he 1
always 1
glided 1
away 1
to 1
some 1
other 1
topic 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
I 1
gave 1
it 1
over 1
in 1
despair 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
yet 1
three 1
when 1
we 1
found 1
ourselves 1
in 1
our 1
rooms 1
once 1
more 1
He 1
hurried 1
to 1
his 1
chamber 1
and 1
was 1
down 1
again 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
dressed 1
as 1
a 1
common 1
loafer 1
With 1
his 1
collar 1
turned 1
up 1
his 1
shiny 1
seedy 1
coat 1
his 1
red 1
cravat 1
and 1
his 1
worn 1
boots 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
perfect 1
sample 1
of 1
the 1
class 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
this 1
should 1
do 1
said 1
he 1
glancing 1
into 1
the 1
glass 1
above 1
the 1
fireplace 1
I 1
only 1
wish 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
Watson 1
but 1
I 1
fear 1
that 1
it 1
won 1
t 1
do 1
I 1
may 1
be 1
on 1
the 1
trail 1
in 1
this 1
matter 1
or 1
I 1
may 1
be 1
following 1
a 1
will 1
o 1
the 1
wisp 1
but 1
I 1
shall 1
soon 1
know 1
which 1
it 1
is 1
I 1
hope 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
be 1
back 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
He 1
cut 1
a 1
slice 1
of 1
beef 1
from 1
the 1
joint 1
upon 1
the 1
sideboard 1
sandwiched 1
it 1
between 1
two 1
rounds 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
thrusting 1
this 1
rude 1
meal 1
into 1
his 1
pocket 1
he 1
started 1
off 1
upon 1
his 1
expedition 1
I 1
had 1
just 1
finished 1
my 1
tea 1
when 1
he 1
returned 1
evidently 1
in 1
excellent 1
spirits 1
swinging 1
an 1
old 1
elastic 1
sided 1
boot 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
He 1
chucked 1
it 1
down 1
into 1
a 1
corner 1
and 1
helped 1
himself 1
to 1
a 1
cup 1
of 1
tea 1
I 1
only 1
looked 1
in 1
as 1
I 1
passed 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
right 1
on 1
Where 1
to 1
Oh 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
West 1
End 1
It 1
may 1
be 1
some 1
time 1
before 1
I 1
get 1
back 1
Don 1
t 1
wait 1
up 1
for 1
me 1
in 1
case 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
late 1
How 1
are 1
you 1
getting 1
on 1
Oh 1
so 2
Nothing 1
to 1
complain 1
of 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
out 1
to 1
Streatham 1
since 1
I 1
saw 1
you 1
last 1
but 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
call 1
at 1
the 1
house 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
sweet 1
little 1
problem 1
and 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
missed 1
it 1
for 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
However 1
I 1
must 1
not 1
sit 1
gossiping 1
here 1
but 1
must 1
get 1
these 1
disreputable 1
clothes 1
off 1
and 1
return 1
to 1
my 1
highly 1
respectable 1
self 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
by 1
his 1
manner 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
stronger 1
reasons 1
for 1
satisfaction 1
than 1
his 1
words 1
alone 1
would 1
imply 1
His 1
eyes 1
twinkled 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
even 1
a 1
touch 1
of 1
colour 1
upon 1
his 1
sallow 1
cheeks 1
He 1
hastened 1
upstairs 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
later 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
slam 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
door 1
which 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
off 1
once 1
more 1
upon 1
his 1
congenial 1
hunt 1
I 1
waited 1
until 1
midnight 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
his 1
return 1
so 1
I 1
retired 1
to 1
my 1
room 1
It 1
was 1
no 1
uncommon 1
thing 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
away 1
for 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
on 1
end 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
hot 1
upon 1
a 1
scent 1
so 1
that 1
his 1
lateness 1
caused 1
me 1
no 1
surprise 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
at 1
what 1
hour 1
he 1
came 1
in 1
but 1
when 1
I 1
came 1
down 1
to 1
breakfast 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
there 1
he 1
was 1
with 1
a 1
cup 1
of 1
coffee 1
in 1
one 1
hand 1
and 1
the 1
paper 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
as 1
fresh 1
and 1
trim 1
as 1
possible 1
You 1
will 1
excuse 1
my 1
beginning 1
without 1
you 1
Watson 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
you 1
remember 1
that 1
our 1
client 1
has 1
rather 1
an 1
early 1
appointment 1
this 1
morning 1
Why 1
it 1
is 1
after 1
nine 1
now 1
I 1
answered 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
surprised 1
if 1
that 1
were 1
he 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
heard 1
a 1
ring 1
It 1
was 1
indeed 1
our 1
friend 1
the 1
financier 1
I 1
was 1
shocked 1
by 1
the 1
change 1
which 1
had 1
come 1
over 1
him 1
for 1
his 1
face 1
which 1
was 1
naturally 1
of 1
a 1
broad 1
and 1
massive 1
mould 1
was 1
now 1
pinched 1
and 1
fallen 1
in 1
while 1
his 1
hair 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
shade 1
whiter 1
He 1
entered 1
with 1
a 1
weariness 1
and 1
lethargy 1
which 1
was 1
even 1
more 1
painful 1
than 1
his 1
violence 1
of 1
the 1
morning 1
before 1
and 1
he 1
dropped 1
heavily 1
into 1
the 1
armchair 1
which 1
I 1
pushed 1
forward 1
for 1
him 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
have 1
done 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
severely 1
tried 1
said 1
he 1
Only 1
two 1
days 1
ago 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
happy 1
and 1
prosperous 1
man 1
without 1
a 1
care 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
Now 1
I 1
am 1
left 1
to 1
a 1
lonely 1
and 1
dishonoured 1
age 1
One 1
sorrow 1
comes 1
close 1
upon 1
the 1
heels 1
of 1
another 1
My 1
niece 1
Mary 1
has 1
deserted 1
me 1
Deserted 1
you 1
Yes 1
Her 1
bed 1
this 1
morning 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
slept 1
in 1
her 1
room 1
was 1
empty 1
and 1
a 1
note 1
for 1
me 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
hall 1
table 1
I 1
had 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
last 1
night 1
in 1
sorrow 1
and 1
not 1
in 1
anger 1
that 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
married 1
my 1
boy 1
all 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
well 1
with 1
him 1
Perhaps 1
it 1
was 1
thoughtless 1
of 1
me 1
to 1
say 1
so 1
It 1
is 1
to 1
that 1
remark 1
that 1
she 1
refers 1
in 1
this 1
note 1
MY 1
DEAREST 1
UNCLE 1
I 1
feel 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
brought 1
trouble 1
upon 1
you 1
and 1
that 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
acted 1
differently 1
this 1
terrible 1
misfortune 1
might 1
never 1
have 1
occurred 1
I 1
cannot 1
with 1
this 1
thought 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
ever 1
again 1
be 1
happy 1
under 1
your 1
roof 1
and 1
I 1
feel 1
that 1
I 1
must 1
leave 1
you 1
forever 1
Do 1
not 1
worry 1
about 1
my 1
future 1
for 1
that 1
is 1
provided 1
for 1
and 1
above 1
all 1
do 1
not 1
search 1
for 1
me 1
for 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
fruitless 1
labour 1
and 1
an 1
ill 1
service 1
to 1
me 1
In 1
life 1
or 1
in 1
death 1
I 1
am 1
ever 1
your 1
loving 1
MARY 1
What 1
could 1
she 1
mean 1
by 1
that 1
note 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
Do 1
you 1
think 1
it 1
points 1
to 1
suicide 1
No 1
no 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
It 1
is 1
perhaps 1
the 1
best 1
possible 1
solution 1
I 1
trust 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
nearing 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
your 1
troubles 1
Ha 1
You 1
say 1
so 1
You 1
have 1
heard 1
something 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
you 1
have 1
learned 1
something 1
Where 1
are 1
the 1
gems 1
You 1
would 1
not 1
think 1
pounds 1
apiece 1
an 1
excessive 1
sum 1
for 1
them 1
I 1
would 1
pay 1
ten 1
That 1
would 1
be 1
unnecessary 1
Three 1
thousand 1
will 1
cover 1
the 1
matter 1
And 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
reward 1
I 1
fancy 1
Have 1
you 1
your 1
check 1
book 1
Here 1
is 1
a 1
pen 1
Better 1
make 1
it 1
out 1
for 1
pounds 1
With 1
a 1
dazed 1
face 1
the 1
banker 1
made 1
out 1
the 1
required 1
check 1
Holmes 1
walked 1
over 1
to 1
his 1
desk 1
took 1
out 1
a 1
little 1
triangular 1
piece 1
of 1
gold 1
with 1
three 1
gems 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
threw 1
it 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
With 1
a 1
shriek 1
of 1
joy 1
our 1
client 1
clutched 1
it 1
up 1
You 1
have 1
it 1
he 1
gasped 1
I 1
am 1
saved 1
I 1
am 1
saved 1
The 1
reaction 1
of 1
joy 1
was 1
as 1
passionate 1
as 1
his 1
grief 1
had 1
been 1
and 1
he 1
hugged 1
his 1
recovered 1
gems 1
to 1
his 1
bosom 1
There 1
is 1
one 1
other 1
thing 1
you 1
owe 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
said 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
rather 1
sternly 1
Owe 1
He 1
caught 1
up 1
a 1
pen 1
Name 1
the 1
sum 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
pay 1
it 1
No 1
the 1
debt 1
is 1
not 1
to 1
me 1
You 1
owe 1
a 1
very 1
humble 1
apology 1
to 1
that 1
noble 1
lad 1
your 1
son 1
who 1
has 1
carried 1
himself 1
in 1
this 1
matter 1
as 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
proud 1
to 1
see 1
my 1
own 1
son 1
do 1
should 1
I 1
ever 1
chance 1
to 1
have 1
one 1
Then 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
Arthur 1
who 1
took 1
them 1
I 1
told 1
you 1
yesterday 1
and 1
I 1
repeat 1
to 1
day 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
You 1
are 1
sure 1
of 1
it 1
Then 1
let 1
us 1
hurry 1
to 1
him 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
let 1
him 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
truth 1
is 1
known 1
He 1
knows 1
it 1
already 1
When 1
I 1
had 1
cleared 1
it 1
all 1
up 1
I 1
had 1
an 1
interview 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
finding 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
tell 1
me 1
the 1
story 1
I 1
told 1
it 1
to 1
him 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
confess 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
right 1
and 1
to 1
add 1
the 1
very 1
few 1
details 1
which 1
were 1
not 1
yet 1
quite 1
clear 1
to 1
me 1
Your 1
news 1
of 1
this 1
morning 1
however 1
may 1
open 1
his 1
lips 1
For 1
heaven 1
s 1
sake 1
tell 1
me 1
then 1
what 1
is 1
this 1
extraordinary 1
mystery 1
I 1
will 1
do 1
so 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
show 1
you 1
the 1
steps 1
by 1
which 1
I 1
reached 1
it 1
And 1
let 1
me 1
say 1
to 1
you 1
first 1
that 1
which 1
it 1
is 1
hardest 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
say 1
and 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
hear 1
there 1
has 1
been 1
an 1
understanding 1
between 1
Sir 1
George 1
Burnwell 1
and 1
your 1
niece 1
Mary 1
They 1
have 1
now 1
fled 1
together 1
My 1
Mary 1
Impossible 1
It 1
is 1
unfortunately 1
more 1
than 1
possible 1
it 1
is 1
certain 1
Neither 1
you 1
nor 1
your 1
son 1
knew 1
the 1
true 1
character 1
of 1
this 1
man 1
when 1
you 1
admitted 1
him 1
into 1
your 1
family 1
circle 1
He 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
dangerous 1
men 1
in 1
England 1
a 1
ruined 1
gambler 1
an 1
absolutely 1
desperate 1
villain 1
a 1
man 1
without 1
heart 1
or 1
conscience 1
Your 1
niece 1
knew 1
nothing 1
of 1
such 1
men 1
When 1
he 1
breathed 1
his 1
vows 1
to 1
her 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
to 1
a 1
hundred 1
before 1
her 1
she 1
flattered 1
herself 1
that 1
she 1
alone 1
had 1
touched 1
his 1
heart 1
The 1
devil 1
knows 1
best 1
what 1
he 1
said 1
but 1
at 1
least 1
she 1
became 1
his 1
tool 1
and 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
seeing 1
him 1
nearly 1
every 1
evening 1
I 1
cannot 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
believe 1
it 1
cried 1
the 1
banker 1
with 1
an 1
ashen 1
face 1
I 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
then 1
what 1
occurred 1
in 1
your 1
house 1
last 1
night 1
Your 1
niece 1
when 1
you 1
had 1
as 1
she 1
thought 1
gone 1
to 1
your 1
room 1
slipped 1
down 1
and 1
talked 1
to 1
her 1
lover 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
which 1
leads 1
into 1
the 1
stable 1
lane 1
His 1
footmarks 1
had 1
pressed 1
right 1
through 1
the 1
snow 1
so 1
long 1
had 1
he 1
stood 1
there 1
She 1
told 1
him 1
of 1
the 1
coronet 1
His 1
wicked 1
lust 1
for 1
gold 1
kindled 1
at 1
the 1
news 1
and 1
he 1
bent 1
her 1
to 1
his 1
will 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
she 1
loved 1
you 1
but 1
there 1
are 1
women 1
in 1
whom 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
a 1
lover 1
extinguishes 1
all 1
other 1
loves 1
and 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
she 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
one 1
She 1
had 1
hardly 1
listened 1
to 1
his 1
instructions 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
you 1
coming 1
downstairs 1
on 1
which 1
she 1
closed 1
the 1
window 1
rapidly 1
and 1
told 1
you 1
about 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
servants 1
escapade 1
with 1
her 1
wooden 1
legged 1
lover 1
which 1
was 1
all 1
perfectly 1
true 1
Your 1
boy 1
Arthur 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
after 1
his 1
interview 1
with 1
you 1
but 1
he 1
slept 1
badly 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
his 1
uneasiness 1
about 1
his 1
club 1
debts 1
In 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
soft 1
tread 1
pass 1
his 1
door 1
so 1
he 1
rose 1
and 1
looking 1
out 1
was 1
surprised 1
to 1
see 1
his 1
cousin 1
walking 1
very 1
stealthily 1
along 1
the 1
passage 1
until 1
she 1
disappeared 1
into 1
your 1
dressing 1
room 1
Petrified 1
with 1
astonishment 1
the 1
lad 1
slipped 1
on 1
some 1
clothes 1
and 1
waited 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
would 1
come 1
of 1
this 1
strange 1
affair 1
Presently 1
she 1
emerged 1
from 1
the 1
room 1
again 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
passage 1
lamp 1
your 1
son 1
saw 1
that 1
she 1
carried 1
the 1
precious 1
coronet 1
in 1
her 1
hands 1
She 1
passed 1
down 1
the 1
stairs 1
and 1
he 1
thrilling 1
with 1
horror 1
ran 1
along 1
and 1
slipped 1
behind 1
the 1
curtain 1
near 1
your 1
door 1
whence 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
what 1
passed 1
in 1
the 1
hall 1
beneath 1
He 1
saw 1
her 1
stealthily 1
open 1
the 1
window 1
hand 1
out 1
the 1
coronet 1
to 1
someone 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
and 1
then 1
closing 1
it 1
once 1
more 1
hurry 1
back 1
to 1
her 1
room 1
passing 1
quite 1
close 1
to 1
where 1
he 1
stood 1
hid 1
behind 1
the 1
curtain 1
As 1
long 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
scene 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
take 1
any 1
action 1
without 1
a 1
horrible 1
exposure 1
of 1
the 1
woman 1
whom 1
he 1
loved 1
But 1
the 1
instant 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
gone 1
he 1
realised 1
how 1
crushing 1
a 1
misfortune 1
this 1
would 1
be 1
for 1
you 1
and 1
how 1
all 1
important 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
set 1
it 1
right 1
He 1
rushed 1
down 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
his 1
bare 1
feet 1
opened 1
the 1
window 1
sprang 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
snow 1
and 1
ran 1
down 1
the 1
lane 1
where 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
a 1
dark 1
figure 1
in 1
the 1
moonlight 1
Sir 1
George 1
Burnwell 1
tried 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
but 1
Arthur 1
caught 1
him 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
struggle 1
between 1
them 1
your 1
lad 1
tugging 1
at 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
coronet 1
and 1
his 1
opponent 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
In 1
the 1
scuffle 1
your 1
son 1
struck 1
Sir 1
George 1
and 1
cut 1
him 1
over 1
the 1
eye 1
Then 1
something 1
suddenly 1
snapped 1
and 1
your 1
son 1
finding 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
coronet 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
rushed 1
back 1
closed 1
the 1
window 1
ascended 1
to 1
your 1
room 1
and 1
had 1
just 1
observed 1
that 1
the 1
coronet 1
had 1
been 1
twisted 1
in 1
the 1
struggle 1
and 1
was 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
straighten 1
it 1
when 1
you 1
appeared 1
upon 1
the 1
scene 1
Is 1
it 1
possible 1
gasped 1
the 1
banker 1
You 1
then 1
roused 1
his 1
anger 1
by 1
calling 1
him 1
names 1
at 1
a 1
moment 1
when 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
deserved 1
your 1
warmest 1
thanks 1
He 1
could 1
not 1
explain 1
the 1
true 1
state 1
of 1
affairs 1
without 1
betraying 1
one 1
who 1
certainly 1
deserved 1
little 1
enough 1
consideration 1
at 1
his 1
hands 1
He 1
took 1
the 1
more 1
chivalrous 1
view 1
however 1
and 1
preserved 1
her 1
secret 1
And 1
that 1
was 1
why 1
she 1
shrieked 1
and 1
fainted 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
coronet 1
cried 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
Oh 1
my 1
God 1
what 1
a 1
blind 1
fool 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
And 1
his 1
asking 1
to 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
for 1
five 1
minutes 1
The 1
dear 1
fellow 1
wanted 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
the 1
missing 1
piece 1
were 1
at 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
struggle 1
How 1
cruelly 1
I 1
have 1
misjudged 1
him 1
When 1
I 1
arrived 1
at 1
the 1
house 1
continued 1
Holmes 1
I 1
at 1
once 1
went 1
very 1
carefully 1
round 1
it 1
to 1
observe 1
if 1
there 1
were 1
any 1
traces 1
in 1
the 1
snow 1
which 1
might 1
help 1
me 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
none 1
had 1
fallen 1
since 1
the 1
evening 1
before 1
and 1
also 1
that 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
strong 1
frost 1
to 1
preserve 1
impressions 1
I 1
passed 1
along 1
the 1
tradesmen 1
s 1
path 1
but 1
found 1
it 1
all 1
trampled 1
down 1
and 1
indistinguishable 1
Just 1
beyond 1
it 1
however 1
at 1
the 1
far 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
kitchen 1
door 1
a 1
woman 1
had 1
stood 1
and 1
talked 1
with 1
a 1
man 1
whose 1
round 1
impressions 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
showed 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
wooden 1
leg 1
I 1
could 1
even 1
tell 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
disturbed 1
for 1
the 1
woman 1
had 1
run 1
back 1
swiftly 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
as 1
was 1
shown 1
by 1
the 1
deep 1
toe 1
and 1
light 1
heel 1
marks 1
while 1
Wooden 1
leg 1
had 1
waited 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
then 1
had 1
gone 1
away 1
I 1
thought 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
this 1
might 1
be 1
the 1
maid 1
and 1
her 1
sweetheart 1
of 1
whom 1
you 1
had 1
already 1
spoken 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
inquiry 1
showed 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
I 1
passed 1
round 1
the 1
garden 1
without 1
seeing 1
anything 1
more 1
than 1
random 1
tracks 1
which 1
I 1
took 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
police 1
but 1
when 1
I 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
stable 1
lane 1
a 1
very 1
long 1
and 1
complex 1
story 1
was 1
written 1
in 1
the 1
snow 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
me 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
double 1
line 1
of 1
tracks 1
of 1
a 1
booted 1
man 1
and 1
a 1
second 1
double 1
line 1
which 1
I 1
saw 1
with 1
delight 1
belonged 1
to 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
naked 1
feet 1
I 1
was 1
at 1
once 1
convinced 1
from 1
what 1
you 1
had 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
latter 1
was 1
your 1
son 1
The 1
first 1
had 1
walked 1
both 1
ways 1
but 1
the 1
other 1
had 1
run 1
swiftly 1
and 1
as 1
his 1
tread 1
was 1
marked 1
in 1
places 1
over 1
the 1
depression 1
of 1
the 1
boot 1
it 1
was 1
obvious 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
passed 1
after 1
the 1
other 1
I 1
followed 1
them 1
up 1
and 1
found 1
they 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
hall 1
window 1
where 1
Boots 1
had 1
worn 1
all 1
the 1
snow 1
away 1
while 1
waiting 1
Then 1
I 1
walked 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
end 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
or 1
more 1
down 1
the 1
lane 1
I 1
saw 1
where 1
Boots 1
had 1
faced 1
round 1
where 1
the 1
snow 1
was 1
cut 1
up 1
as 1
though 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
struggle 1
and 1
finally 1
where 1
a 1
few 1
drops 1
of 1
blood 1
had 1
fallen 1
to 1
show 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
mistaken 1
Boots 1
had 1
then 1
run 1
down 1
the 1
lane 1
and 1
another 1
little 1
smudge 1
of 1
blood 1
showed 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
hurt 1
When 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
highroad 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
end 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
pavement 1
had 1
been 1
cleared 1
so 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
that 1
clue 1
On 1
entering 1
the 1
house 1
however 1
I 1
examined 1
as 1
you 1
remember 1
the 1
sill 1
and 1
framework 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
window 1
with 1
my 1
lens 1
and 1
I 1
could 1
at 1
once 1
see 1
that 1
someone 1
had 1
passed 1
out 1
I 1
could 1
distinguish 1
the 1
outline 1
of 1
an 1
instep 1
where 1
the 1
wet 1
foot 1
had 1
been 1
placed 1
in 1
coming 1
in 1
I 1
was 1
then 1
beginning 1
to 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
form 1
an 1
opinion 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
had 1
occurred 1
A 1
man 1
had 1
waited 1
outside 1
the 1
window 1
someone 1
had 1
brought 1
the 1
gems 1
the 1
deed 1
had 1
been 1
overseen 1
by 1
your 1
son 1
he 1
had 1
pursued 1
the 1
thief 1
had 1
struggled 1
with 1
him 1
they 1
had 1
each 1
tugged 1
at 1
the 1
coronet 1
their 1
united 1
strength 1
causing 1
injuries 1
which 1
neither 1
alone 1
could 1
have 1
effected 1
He 1
had 1
returned 1
with 1
the 1
prize 1
but 1
had 1
left 1
a 1
fragment 1
in 1
the 1
grasp 1
of 1
his 1
opponent 1
So 1
far 1
I 1
was 1
clear 1
The 1
question 1
now 1
was 1
who 1
was 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
who 1
was 1
it 1
brought 1
him 1
the 1
coronet 1
It 1
is 1
an 1
old 1
maxim 1
of 1
mine 1
that 1
when 1
you 1
have 1
excluded 1
the 1
impossible 1
whatever 1
remains 1
however 1
improbable 1
must 1
be 1
the 1
truth 1
Now 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
you 1
who 1
had 1
brought 1
it 1
down 1
so 1
there 1
only 1
remained 1
your 1
niece 1
and 1
the 1
maids 1
But 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
the 1
maids 1
why 1
should 1
your 1
son 1
allow 1
himself 1
to 1
be 1
accused 1
in 1
their 1
place 1
There 1
could 1
be 1
no 1
possible 1
reason 1
As 1
he 1
loved 1
his 1
cousin 1
however 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
excellent 1
explanation 1
why 1
he 1
should 1
retain 1
her 1
secret 1
the 1
more 1
so 1
as 1
the 1
secret 1
was 1
a 1
disgraceful 1
one 1
When 1
I 1
remembered 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
seen 1
her 1
at 1
that 1
window 1
and 1
how 1
she 1
had 1
fainted 1
on 1
seeing 1
the 1
coronet 1
again 1
my 1
conjecture 1
became 1
a 1
certainty 1
And 1
who 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
who 1
was 1
her 1
confederate 1
A 1
lover 1
evidently 1
for 1
who 1
else 1
could 1
outweigh 1
the 1
love 1
and 1
gratitude 1
which 1
she 1
must 1
feel 1
to 1
you 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
you 1
went 1
out 1
little 1
and 1
that 1
your 1
circle 1
of 1
friends 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
limited 1
one 1
But 1
among 1
them 1
was 1
Sir 1
George 1
Burnwell 1
I 1
had 1
heard 1
of 1
him 1
before 1
as 1
being 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
evil 1
reputation 1
among 1
women 1
It 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
he 1
who 1
wore 1
those 1
boots 1
and 1
retained 1
the 1
missing 1
gems 1
Even 1
though 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
Arthur 1
had 1
discovered 1
him 1
he 1
might 1
still 1
flatter 1
himself 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
safe 1
for 1
the 1
lad 1
could 1
not 1
say 1
a 1
word 1
without 1
compromising 1
his 1
own 1
family 1
Well 1
your 1
own 1
good 1
sense 1
will 1
suggest 1
what 1
measures 1
I 1
took 1
next 1
I 1
went 1
in 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
a 1
loafer 1
to 1
Sir 1
George 1
s 1
house 1
managed 1
to 1
pick 1
up 1
an 1
acquaintance 1
with 1
his 1
valet 1
learned 1
that 1
his 1
master 1
had 1
cut 1
his 1
head 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
and 1
finally 1
at 1
the 1
expense 1
of 1
six 1
shillings 1
made 1
all 1
sure 1
by 1
buying 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
his 1
cast 1
off 1
shoes 1
With 1
these 1
I 1
journeyed 1
down 1
to 1
Streatham 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
they 1
exactly 1
fitted 1
the 1
tracks 1
I 1
saw 1
an 1
ill 1
dressed 1
vagabond 1
in 1
the 1
lane 1
yesterday 1
evening 1
said 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
Precisely 1
It 1
was 1
I 2
found 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
my 1
man 1
so 1
I 1
came 1
home 1
and 1
changed 1
my 1
clothes 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
delicate 1
part 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
play 1
then 1
for 1
I 1
saw 1
that 1
a 1
prosecution 1
must 1
be 1
avoided 1
to 1
avert 1
scandal 1
and 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
so 1
astute 1
a 1
villain 1
would 1
see 1
that 1
our 1
hands 1
were 1
tied 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
I 1
went 1
and 1
saw 1
him 1
At 1
first 1
of 1
course 1
he 1
denied 1
everything 1
But 1
when 1
I 1
gave 1
him 1
every 1
particular 1
that 1
had 1
occurred 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
bluster 1
and 1
took 1
down 1
a 1
life 1
preserver 1
from 1
the 1
wall 1
I 1
knew 1
my 1
man 1
however 1
and 1
I 1
clapped 1
a 1
pistol 1
to 1
his 1
head 1
before 1
he 1
could 1
strike 1
Then 1
he 1
became 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
reasonable 1
I 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
we 1
would 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
price 1
for 1
the 1
stones 1
he 1
held 1
pounds 1
apiece 1
That 1
brought 1
out 1
the 1
first 1
signs 1
of 1
grief 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
shown 1
Why 1
dash 1
it 1
all 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
ve 1
let 1
them 1
go 1
at 1
six 1
hundred 1
for 1
the 1
three 1
I 1
soon 1
managed 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
address 1
of 1
the 1
receiver 1
who 1
had 1
them 1
on 1
promising 1
him 1
that 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
no 1
prosecution 1
Off 1
I 1
set 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
after 1
much 1
chaffering 1
I 1
got 1
our 1
stones 1
at 1
pounds 1
apiece 1
Then 1
I 1
looked 1
in 1
upon 1
your 1
son 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
all 1
was 1
right 1
and 1
eventually 1
got 1
to 1
my 1
bed 1
about 1
two 1
o 1
clock 1
after 1
what 1
I 1
may 1
call 1
a 1
really 1
hard 1
day 1
s 1
work 1
A 1
day 1
which 1
has 1
saved 1
England 1
from 1
a 1
great 1
public 1
scandal 1
said 1
the 1
banker 1
rising 1
Sir 1
I 1
cannot 1
find 1
words 1
to 1
thank 1
you 1
but 1
you 1
shall 1
not 1
find 1
me 1
ungrateful 1
for 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
done 1
Your 1
skill 1
has 1
indeed 1
exceeded 1
all 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
heard 1
of 1
it 1
And 1
now 1
I 1
must 1
fly 1
to 1
my 1
dear 1
boy 1
to 1
apologise 1
to 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
wrong 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
done 1
him 1
As 1
to 1
what 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
of 1
poor 1
Mary 1
it 1
goes 1
to 1
my 1
very 1
heart 1
Not 1
even 1
your 1
skill 1
can 1
inform 1
me 1
where 1
she 1
is 1
now 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
safely 1
say 1
returned 1
Holmes 1
that 1
she 1
is 1
wherever 1
Sir 1
George 1
Burnwell 1
is 1
It 1
is 1
equally 1
certain 1
too 1
that 1
whatever 1
her 1
sins 1
are 1
they 1
will 1
soon 1
receive 1
a 1
more 1
than 1
sufficient 1
punishment 1
XII 1
THE 1
ADVENTURE 1
OF 1
THE 1
COPPER 1
BEECHES 1
To 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
loves 1
art 1
for 1
its 1
own 1
sake 1
remarked 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
tossing 1
aside 1
the 1
advertisement 1
sheet 1
of 1
the 1
Daily 1
Telegraph 1
it 1
is 1
frequently 1
in 1
its 1
least 1
important 1
and 1
lowliest 1
manifestations 1
that 1
the 1
keenest 1
pleasure 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
derived 1
It 1
is 1
pleasant 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
observe 1
Watson 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
so 1
far 1
grasped 1
this 1
truth 1
that 1
in 1
these 1
little 1
records 1
of 1
our 1
cases 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
draw 1
up 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
bound 1
to 1
say 1
occasionally 1
to 1
embellish 1
you 1
have 1
given 1
prominence 1
not 1
so 1
much 1
to 1
the 1
many 1
causes 1
celebres 1
and 1
sensational 1
trials 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
figured 1
but 1
rather 1
to 1
those 1
incidents 1
which 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
trivial 1
in 1
themselves 1
but 1
which 1
have 1
given 1
room 1
for 1
those 1
faculties 1
of 1
deduction 1
and 1
of 1
logical 1
synthesis 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
made 1
my 1
special 1
province 1
And 1
yet 1
said 1
I 1
smiling 1
I 1
cannot 1
quite 1
hold 1
myself 1
absolved 1
from 1
the 1
charge 1
of 1
sensationalism 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
urged 1
against 1
my 1
records 1
You 1
have 1
erred 1
perhaps 1
he 1
observed 1
taking 1
up 1
a 1
glowing 1
cinder 1
with 1
the 1
tongs 1
and 1
lighting 1
with 1
it 1
the 1
long 1
cherry 1
wood 1
pipe 1
which 1
was 1
wont 1
to 1
replace 1
his 1
clay 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
disputatious 1
rather 1
than 1
a 1
meditative 1
mood 1
you 1
have 1
erred 1
perhaps 1
in 1
attempting 1
to 1
put 1
colour 1
and 1
life 1
into 1
each 1
of 1
your 1
statements 1
instead 1
of 1
confining 1
yourself 1
to 1
the 1
task 1
of 1
placing 1
upon 1
record 1
that 1
severe 1
reasoning 1
from 1
cause 1
to 1
effect 1
which 1
is 1
really 1
the 1
only 1
notable 1
feature 1
about 1
the 1
thing 1
It 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
done 1
you 1
full 1
justice 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
I 1
remarked 1
with 1
some 1
coldness 1
for 1
I 1
was 1
repelled 1
by 1
the 1
egotism 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
observed 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
strong 1
factor 1
in 1
my 1
friend 1
s 1
singular 1
character 1
No 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
selfishness 1
or 1
conceit 1
said 1
he 1
answering 1
as 1
was 1
his 1
wont 1
my 1
thoughts 1
rather 1
than 1
my 1
words 1
If 1
I 1
claim 1
full 1
justice 1
for 1
my 1
art 1
it 1
is 1
because 1
it 1
is 1
an 1
impersonal 1
thing 1
a 1
thing 1
beyond 1
myself 1
Crime 1
is 1
common 1
Logic 1
is 1
rare 1
Therefore 1
it 1
is 1
upon 1
the 1
logic 1
rather 1
than 1
upon 1
the 1
crime 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
dwell 1
You 1
have 1
degraded 1
what 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
course 1
of 1
lectures 1
into 1
a 1
series 1
of 1
tales 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
cold 1
morning 1
of 1
the 1
early 1
spring 1
and 1
we 1
sat 1
after 1
breakfast 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
a 1
cheery 1
fire 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
room 1
at 1
Baker 1
Street 1
A 1
thick 1
fog 1
rolled 1
down 1
between 1
the 1
lines 1
of 1
dun 1
coloured 1
houses 1
and 1
the 1
opposing 1
windows 1
loomed 1
like 1
dark 1
shapeless 1
blurs 1
through 1
the 1
heavy 1
yellow 1
wreaths 1
Our 1
gas 1
was 1
lit 1
and 1
shone 1
on 1
the 1
white 1
cloth 1
and 1
glimmer 1
of 1
china 1
and 1
metal 1
for 1
the 1
table 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
cleared 1
yet 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
had 1
been 1
silent 1
all 1
the 1
morning 1
dipping 1
continuously 1
into 1
the 1
advertisement 1
columns 1
of 1
a 1
succession 1
of 1
papers 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
having 1
apparently 1
given 1
up 1
his 1
search 1
he 1
had 1
emerged 1
in 1
no 1
very 1
sweet 1
temper 1
to 1
lecture 1
me 1
upon 1
my 1
literary 1
shortcomings 1
At 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
he 1
remarked 1
after 1
a 1
pause 1
during 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
sat 1
puffing 1
at 1
his 1
long 1
pipe 1
and 1
gazing 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
fire 1
you 1
can 1
hardly 1
be 1
open 1
to 1
a 1
charge 1
of 1
sensationalism 1
for 1
out 1
of 1
these 1
cases 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
kind 1
as 1
to 1
interest 1
yourself 1
in 1
a 1
fair 1
proportion 1
do 1
not 1
treat 1
of 1
crime 1
in 1
its 1
legal 1
sense 1
at 1
all 1
The 1
small 1
matter 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
help 1
the 1
King 1
of 1
Bohemia 1
the 1
singular 1
experience 1
of 1
Miss 1
Mary 1
Sutherland 1
the 1
problem 1
connected 1
with 1
the 1
man 1
with 1
the 1
twisted 1
lip 1
and 1
the 1
incident 1
of 1
the 1
noble 1
bachelor 1
were 1
all 1
matters 1
which 1
are 1
outside 1
the 1
pale 1
of 1
the 1
law 1
But 1
in 1
avoiding 1
the 1
sensational 1
I 1
fear 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
bordered 1
on 1
the 1
trivial 1
The 1
end 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
I 1
answered 1
but 1
the 1
methods 1
I 1
hold 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
novel 1
and 1
of 1
interest 1
Pshaw 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
what 1
do 1
the 1
public 1
the 1
great 1
unobservant 1
public 1
who 1
could 1
hardly 1
tell 1
a 1
weaver 1
by 1
his 1
tooth 1
or 1
a 1
compositor 1
by 1
his 1
left 1
thumb 1
care 1
about 1
the 1
finer 1
shades 1
of 1
analysis 1
and 1
deduction 1
But 1
indeed 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
trivial 1
I 1
cannot 1
blame 1
you 1
for 1
the 1
days 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
cases 1
are 1
past 1
Man 1
or 1
at 1
least 1
criminal 1
man 1
has 1
lost 1
all 1
enterprise 1
and 1
originality 1
As 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
little 1
practice 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
degenerating 1
into 1
an 1
agency 1
for 1
recovering 1
lost 1
lead 1
pencils 1
and 1
giving 1
advice 1
to 1
young 1
ladies 1
from 1
boarding 1
schools 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
touched 1
bottom 1
at 1
last 1
however 1
This 1
note 1
I 1
had 1
this 1
morning 1
marks 1
my 1
zero 1
point 1
I 1
fancy 1
Read 1
it 1
He 1
tossed 1
a 1
crumpled 1
letter 1
across 1
to 1
me 1
It 1
was 1
dated 1
from 1
Montague 1
Place 1
upon 1
the 1
preceding 1
evening 1
and 1
ran 1
thus 1
DEAR 1
MR 1
HOLMES 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
anxious 1
to 1
consult 1
you 1
as 1
to 1
whether 1
I 1
should 1
or 1
should 1
not 1
accept 1
a 1
situation 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
offered 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
governess 1
I 1
shall 1
call 1
at 1
half 1
past 1
ten 1
to 1
morrow 1
if 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
inconvenience 1
you 1
Yours 1
faithfully 1
VIOLET 1
HUNTER 1
Do 1
you 1
know 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
I 1
asked 1
Not 1
I 1
It 1
is 1
half 1
past 1
ten 1
now 1
Yes 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
is 1
her 1
ring 1
It 1
may 1
turn 1
out 1
to 1
be 1
of 1
more 1
interest 1
than 1
you 1
think 1
You 1
remember 1
that 1
the 1
affair 1
of 1
the 1
blue 1
carbuncle 1
which 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
mere 1
whim 1
at 1
first 1
developed 1
into 1
a 1
serious 1
investigation 1
It 1
may 1
be 1
so 1
in 1
this 1
case 1
also 1
Well 1
let 1
us 1
hope 1
so 1
But 1
our 1
doubts 1
will 1
very 1
soon 1
be 1
solved 1
for 1
here 1
unless 1
I 1
am 1
much 1
mistaken 1
is 1
the 1
person 1
in 1
question 1
As 1
he 1
spoke 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
She 1
was 1
plainly 1
but 1
neatly 1
dressed 1
with 1
a 1
bright 1
quick 1
face 1
freckled 1
like 1
a 1
plover 1
s 1
egg 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
brisk 1
manner 1
of 1
a 1
woman 1
who 1
has 1
had 1
her 1
own 1
way 1
to 1
make 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
You 1
will 1
excuse 1
my 1
troubling 1
you 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
said 1
she 1
as 1
my 1
companion 1
rose 1
to 1
greet 1
her 1
but 1
I 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
very 1
strange 1
experience 1
and 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
parents 1
or 1
relations 1
of 1
any 1
sort 1
from 1
whom 1
I 1
could 1
ask 1
advice 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
perhaps 1
you 1
would 1
be 1
kind 1
enough 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
I 1
should 1
do 1
Pray 1
take 1
a 1
seat 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
happy 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
that 1
I 1
can 1
to 1
serve 1
you 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
Holmes 1
was 1
favourably 1
impressed 1
by 1
the 1
manner 1
and 1
speech 1
of 1
his 1
new 1
client 1
He 1
looked 1
her 1
over 1
in 1
his 1
searching 1
fashion 1
and 1
then 1
composed 1
himself 1
with 1
his 1
lids 1
drooping 1
and 1
his 1
finger 1
tips 1
together 1
to 1
listen 1
to 1
her 1
story 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
governess 1
for 1
five 1
years 1
said 1
she 1
in 1
the 1
family 1
of 1
Colonel 1
Spence 1
Munro 1
but 1
two 1
months 1
ago 1
the 1
colonel 1
received 1
an 1
appointment 1
at 1
Halifax 1
in 1
Nova 1
Scotia 1
and 1
took 1
his 1
children 1
over 1
to 1
America 1
with 1
him 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
found 1
myself 1
without 1
a 1
situation 1
I 1
advertised 1
and 1
I 1
answered 1
advertisements 1
but 1
without 1
success 1
At 1
last 1
the 1
little 1
money 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
saved 1
began 1
to 1
run 1
short 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
at 1
my 1
wit 1
s 1
end 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
I 1
should 1
do 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
well 1
known 1
agency 1
for 1
governesses 1
in 1
the 1
West 1
End 1
called 1
Westaway 1
s 1
and 1
there 1
I 1
used 1
to 1
call 1
about 1
once 1
a 1
week 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
see 1
whether 1
anything 1
had 1
turned 1
up 1
which 1
might 1
suit 1
me 1
Westaway 1
was 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
founder 1
of 1
the 1
business 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
really 1
managed 1
by 1
Miss 1
Stoper 1
She 1
sits 1
in 1
her 1
own 1
little 1
office 1
and 1
the 1
ladies 1
who 1
are 1
seeking 1
employment 1
wait 1
in 1
an 1
anteroom 1
and 1
are 1
then 1
shown 1
in 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
when 1
she 1
consults 1
her 1
ledgers 1
and 1
sees 1
whether 1
she 1
has 1
anything 1
which 1
would 1
suit 1
them 1
Well 1
when 1
I 1
called 1
last 1
week 1
I 1
was 1
shown 1
into 1
the 1
little 1
office 1
as 1
usual 1
but 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
Miss 1
Stoper 1
was 1
not 1
alone 1
A 1
prodigiously 1
stout 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
smiling 1
face 1
and 1
a 1
great 1
heavy 1
chin 1
which 1
rolled 1
down 1
in 1
fold 1
upon 1
fold 1
over 1
his 1
throat 1
sat 1
at 1
her 1
elbow 1
with 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
glasses 1
on 1
his 1
nose 1
looking 1
very 1
earnestly 1
at 1
the 1
ladies 1
who 1
entered 1
As 1
I 1
came 1
in 1
he 1
gave 1
quite 1
a 1
jump 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
turned 1
quickly 1
to 1
Miss 1
Stoper 1
That 1
will 1
do 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
ask 1
for 1
anything 1
better 1
Capital 1
capital 1
He 1
seemed 1
quite 1
enthusiastic 1
and 1
rubbed 1
his 1
hands 1
together 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
genial 1
fashion 1
He 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
comfortable 1
looking 1
man 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
a 1
pleasure 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
him 1
You 1
are 1
looking 1
for 1
a 1
situation 1
miss 1
he 1
asked 1
Yes 1
sir 1
As 1
governess 1
Yes 1
sir 1
And 1
what 1
salary 1
do 1
you 1
ask 1
I 1
had 1
pounds 1
a 1
month 1
in 1
my 1
last 1
place 1
with 1
Colonel 1
Spence 1
Munro 1
Oh 1
tut 2
sweating 1
rank 1
sweating 1
he 1
cried 1
throwing 1
his 1
fat 1
hands 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
like 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
in 1
a 1
boiling 1
passion 1
How 1
could 1
anyone 1
offer 1
so 1
pitiful 1
a 1
sum 1
to 1
a 1
lady 1
with 1
such 1
attractions 1
and 1
accomplishments 1
My 1
accomplishments 1
sir 1
may 1
be 1
less 1
than 1
you 1
imagine 1
said 1
I 1
A 1
little 1
French 1
a 1
little 1
German 1
music 1
and 1
drawing 1
Tut 1
tut 1
he 1
cried 1
This 1
is 1
all 1
quite 1
beside 1
the 1
question 1
The 1
point 1
is 1
have 1
you 1
or 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
the 1
bearing 1
and 1
deportment 1
of 1
a 1
lady 1
There 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
a 1
nutshell 1
If 1
you 1
have 1
not 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
fitted 1
for 1
the 1
rearing 1
of 1
a 1
child 1
who 1
may 1
some 1
day 1
play 1
a 1
considerable 1
part 1
in 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
But 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
why 1
then 1
how 1
could 1
any 1
gentleman 1
ask 1
you 1
to 1
condescend 1
to 1
accept 1
anything 1
under 1
the 1
three 1
figures 1
Your 1
salary 1
with 1
me 1
madam 1
would 1
commence 1
at 1
pounds 1
a 1
year 1
You 1
may 1
imagine 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
that 1
to 1
me 1
destitute 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
such 1
an 1
offer 1
seemed 1
almost 1
too 1
good 1
to 1
be 1
true 1
The 1
gentleman 1
however 1
seeing 1
perhaps 1
the 1
look 1
of 1
incredulity 1
upon 1
my 1
face 1
opened 1
a 1
pocket 1
book 1
and 1
took 1
out 1
a 1
note 1
It 1
is 1
also 1
my 1
custom 1
said 1
he 1
smiling 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
pleasant 1
fashion 1
until 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
just 1
two 1
little 1
shining 1
slits 1
amid 1
the 1
white 1
creases 1
of 1
his 1
face 1
to 1
advance 1
to 1
my 1
young 1
ladies 1
half 1
their 1
salary 1
beforehand 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
may 1
meet 1
any 1
little 1
expenses 1
of 1
their 1
journey 1
and 1
their 1
wardrobe 1
It 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
never 1
met 1
so 1
fascinating 1
and 1
so 1
thoughtful 1
a 1
man 1
As 1
I 1
was 1
already 1
in 1
debt 1
to 1
my 1
tradesmen 1
the 1
advance 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
convenience 1
and 1
yet 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
unnatural 1
about 1
the 1
whole 1
transaction 1
which 1
made 1
me 1
wish 1
to 1
know 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
before 1
I 1
quite 1
committed 1
myself 1
May 1
I 1
ask 1
where 1
you 1
live 1
sir 1
said 1
I 1
Hampshire 1
Charming 1
rural 1
place 1
The 1
Copper 1
Beeches 1
five 1
miles 1
on 1
the 1
far 1
side 1
of 1
Winchester 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
lovely 1
country 1
my 1
dear 1
young 1
lady 1
and 1
the 1
dearest 1
old 1
country 1
house 1
And 1
my 1
duties 1
sir 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
glad 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
One 1
child 1
one 1
dear 1
little 1
romper 1
just 1
six 1
years 1
old 1
Oh 1
if 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
him 1
killing 1
cockroaches 1
with 1
a 1
slipper 1
Smack 1
smack 2
Three 1
gone 1
before 1
you 1
could 1
wink 1
He 1
leaned 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
laughed 1
his 1
eyes 1
into 1
his 1
head 1
again 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
startled 1
at 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
s 1
amusement 1
but 1
the 1
father 1
s 1
laughter 1
made 1
me 1
think 1
that 1
perhaps 1
he 1
was 1
joking 1
My 1
sole 1
duties 1
then 1
I 1
asked 1
are 1
to 1
take 1
charge 1
of 1
a 1
single 1
child 1
No 1
no 1
not 1
the 1
sole 1
not 1
the 1
sole 1
my 1
dear 1
young 1
lady 1
he 1
cried 1
Your 1
duty 1
would 1
be 1
as 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
your 1
good 1
sense 1
would 1
suggest 1
to 1
obey 1
any 1
little 1
commands 1
my 1
wife 1
might 1
give 1
provided 1
always 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
such 1
commands 1
as 1
a 1
lady 1
might 1
with 1
propriety 1
obey 1
You 1
see 1
no 1
difficulty 1
heh 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
happy 1
to 1
make 1
myself 1
useful 1
Quite 1
so 1
In 1
dress 1
now 1
for 1
example 1
We 1
are 1
faddy 1
people 1
you 1
know 1
faddy 1
but 1
kind 1
hearted 1
If 1
you 1
were 1
asked 1
to 1
wear 1
any 1
dress 1
which 1
we 1
might 1
give 1
you 2
would 1
not 1
object 1
to 1
our 1
little 1
whim 1
Heh 1
No 1
said 1
I 1
considerably 1
astonished 1
at 1
his 1
words 1
Or 1
to 1
sit 1
here 1
or 1
sit 1
there 1
that 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
offensive 1
to 1
you 1
Oh 1
no 1
Or 1
to 1
cut 1
your 1
hair 1
quite 1
short 1
before 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
us 1
I 1
could 1
hardly 1
believe 1
my 1
ears 1
As 1
you 1
may 1
observe 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
my 1
hair 1
is 1
somewhat 1
luxuriant 1
and 1
of 1
a 1
rather 1
peculiar 1
tint 1
of 1
chestnut 1
It 1
has 1
been 1
considered 1
artistic 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
dream 1
of 1
sacrificing 1
it 1
in 1
this 1
offhand 1
fashion 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 2
is 1
quite 1
impossible 1
said 1
I 1
He 1
had 1
been 1
watching 1
me 1
eagerly 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
small 1
eyes 1
and 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
a 1
shadow 1
pass 1
over 1
his 1
face 1
as 1
I 1
spoke 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
essential 1
said 1
he 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
fancy 1
of 1
my 1
wife 1
s 1
and 1
ladies 1
fancies 1
you 1
know 1
madam 1
ladies 1
fancies 1
must 1
be 1
consulted 1
And 1
so 1
you 1
won 1
t 1
cut 1
your 1
hair 1
No 1
sir 1
I 1
really 1
could 1
not 1
I 1
answered 1
firmly 1
Ah 1
very 1
well 1
then 1
that 1
quite 1
settles 1
the 1
matter 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
pity 1
because 1
in 1
other 1
respects 1
you 1
would 1
really 1
have 1
done 1
very 1
nicely 1
In 1
that 1
case 1
Miss 1
Stoper 1
I 1
had 1
best 1
inspect 1
a 1
few 1
more 1
of 1
your 1
young 1
ladies 1
The 1
manageress 1
had 1
sat 1
all 1
this 1
while 1
busy 1
with 1
her 1
papers 1
without 1
a 1
word 1
to 1
either 1
of 1
us 1
but 1
she 1
glanced 1
at 1
me 1
now 1
with 1
so 1
much 1
annoyance 1
upon 1
her 1
face 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
suspecting 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
lost 1
a 1
handsome 1
commission 1
through 1
my 1
refusal 1
Do 1
you 1
desire 1
your 1
name 1
to 1
be 1
kept 1
upon 1
the 1
books 1
she 1
asked 1
If 1
you 1
please 1
Miss 1
Stoper 1
Well 1
really 1
it 1
seems 1
rather 1
useless 1
since 1
you 1
refuse 1
the 1
most 1
excellent 1
offers 1
in 1
this 1
fashion 1
said 1
she 1
sharply 1
You 1
can 1
hardly 1
expect 1
us 1
to 1
exert 1
ourselves 1
to 1
find 1
another 1
such 1
opening 1
for 1
you 1
Good 1
day 1
to 1
you 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
She 1
struck 1
a 1
gong 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
shown 1
out 1
by 1
the 1
page 1
Well 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
when 1
I 1
got 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
lodgings 1
and 1
found 1
little 1
enough 1
in 1
the 1
cupboard 1
and 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
bills 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
I 1
began 1
to 1
ask 1
myself 1
whether 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
done 1
a 1
very 1
foolish 1
thing 1
After 1
all 1
if 1
these 1
people 1
had 1
strange 1
fads 1
and 1
expected 1
obedience 1
on 1
the 1
most 1
extraordinary 1
matters 1
they 1
were 1
at 1
least 1
ready 1
to 1
pay 1
for 1
their 1
eccentricity 1
Very 1
few 1
governesses 1
in 1
England 1
are 1
getting 1
pounds 1
a 1
year 1
Besides 1
what 1
use 1
was 1
my 1
hair 1
to 1
me 1
Many 1
people 1
are 1
improved 1
by 1
wearing 1
it 1
short 1
and 1
perhaps 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
among 1
the 1
number 1
Next 1
day 1
I 1
was 1
inclined 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
made 1
a 1
mistake 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
day 1
after 1
I 1
was 1
sure 1
of 1
it 1
I 1
had 1
almost 1
overcome 1
my 1
pride 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
agency 1
and 1
inquire 1
whether 1
the 1
place 1
was 1
still 1
open 1
when 1
I 1
received 1
this 1
letter 1
from 1
the 1
gentleman 1
himself 1
I 1
have 1
it 1
here 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
read 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
The 1
Copper 1
Beeches 1
near 1
Winchester 1
DEAR 1
MISS 1
HUNTER 1
Miss 1
Stoper 1
has 1
very 1
kindly 1
given 1
me 1
your 1
address 1
and 1
I 1
write 1
from 1
here 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
whether 1
you 1
have 1
reconsidered 1
your 1
decision 1
My 1
wife 1
is 1
very 1
anxious 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
come 1
for 1
she 1
has 1
been 1
much 1
attracted 1
by 1
my 1
description 1
of 1
you 1
We 1
are 1
willing 1
to 1
give 1
pounds 1
a 1
quarter 1
or 1
pounds 1
a 1
year 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
recompense 1
you 1
for 1
any 1
little 1
inconvenience 1
which 1
our 1
fads 1
may 1
cause 1
you 1
They 1
are 1
not 1
very 1
exacting 1
after 1
all 1
My 1
wife 1
is 1
fond 1
of 1
a 1
particular 1
shade 1
of 1
electric 1
blue 1
and 1
would 1
like 1
you 1
to 1
wear 1
such 1
a 1
dress 1
indoors 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
You 1
need 1
not 1
however 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
expense 1
of 1
purchasing 1
one 1
as 1
we 1
have 1
one 1
belonging 1
to 1
my 1
dear 1
daughter 1
Alice 1
now 1
in 1
Philadelphia 1
which 1
would 1
I 1
should 1
think 1
fit 1
you 1
very 1
well 1
Then 1
as 1
to 1
sitting 1
here 1
or 1
there 1
or 1
amusing 1
yourself 1
in 1
any 1
manner 1
indicated 1
that 1
need 1
cause 1
you 1
no 1
inconvenience 1
As 1
regards 1
your 1
hair 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
doubt 1
a 1
pity 1
especially 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
remarking 1
its 1
beauty 1
during 1
our 1
short 1
interview 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
I 1
must 1
remain 1
firm 1
upon 1
this 1
point 1
and 1
I 1
only 1
hope 1
that 1
the 1
increased 1
salary 1
may 1
recompense 1
you 1
for 1
the 1
loss 1
Your 1
duties 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
the 1
child 1
is 1
concerned 1
are 1
very 1
light 1
Now 1
do 1
try 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
I 1
shall 1
meet 1
you 1
with 1
the 1
dog 1
cart 1
at 1
Winchester 1
Let 1
me 1
know 1
your 1
train 1
Yours 1
faithfully 1
JEPHRO 1
RUCASTLE 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
letter 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
just 1
received 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
and 1
my 1
mind 1
is 1
made 1
up 1
that 1
I 1
will 1
accept 1
it 1
I 1
thought 1
however 1
that 1
before 1
taking 1
the 1
final 1
step 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
submit 1
the 1
whole 1
matter 1
to 1
your 1
consideration 1
Well 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
if 1
your 1
mind 1
is 1
made 1
up 1
that 1
settles 1
the 1
question 1
said 1
Holmes 1
smiling 1
But 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
advise 1
me 1
to 1
refuse 1
I 1
confess 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
situation 1
which 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
sister 1
of 1
mine 1
apply 1
for 1
What 1
is 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
it 1
all 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
Ah 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
data 1
I 1
cannot 1
tell 1
Perhaps 1
you 1
have 1
yourself 1
formed 1
some 1
opinion 1
Well 1
there 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
only 1
one 1
possible 1
solution 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
very 1
kind 1
good 1
natured 1
man 1
Is 1
it 1
not 1
possible 1
that 1
his 1
wife 1
is 1
a 1
lunatic 1
that 1
he 1
desires 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
matter 1
quiet 1
for 1
fear 1
she 1
should 1
be 1
taken 1
to 1
an 1
asylum 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
humours 1
her 1
fancies 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
prevent 1
an 1
outbreak 1
That 1
is 1
a 1
possible 1
solution 1
in 1
fact 1
as 1
matters 1
stand 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
probable 1
one 1
But 1
in 1
any 1
case 1
it 1
does 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
nice 1
household 1
for 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
But 1
the 1
money 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
the 1
money 1
Well 1
yes 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
pay 1
is 1
good 1
too 1
good 1
That 1
is 1
what 1
makes 1
me 1
uneasy 1
Why 1
should 1
they 1
give 1
you 1
pounds 1
a 1
year 1
when 1
they 1
could 1
have 1
their 1
pick 1
for 1
pounds 1
There 1
must 1
be 1
some 1
strong 1
reason 1
behind 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
if 1
I 1
told 1
you 1
the 1
circumstances 1
you 1
would 1
understand 1
afterwards 1
if 1
I 1
wanted 1
your 1
help 1
I 1
should 1
feel 1
so 1
much 1
stronger 1
if 1
I 1
felt 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
me 1
Oh 1
you 1
may 1
carry 1
that 1
feeling 1
away 1
with 1
you 1
I 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
your 1
little 1
problem 1
promises 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
most 1
interesting 1
which 1
has 1
come 1
my 1
way 1
for 1
some 1
months 1
There 1
is 1
something 1
distinctly 1
novel 1
about 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
features 1
If 1
you 1
should 1
find 1
yourself 1
in 1
doubt 1
or 1
in 1
danger 1
Danger 1
What 1
danger 1
do 1
you 1
foresee 1
Holmes 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
gravely 1
It 1
would 1
cease 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
danger 1
if 1
we 1
could 1
define 1
it 1
said 1
he 1
But 1
at 1
any 1
time 1
day 1
or 1
night 1
a 1
telegram 1
would 1
bring 1
me 1
down 1
to 1
your 1
help 1
That 1
is 1
enough 1
She 1
rose 1
briskly 1
from 1
her 1
chair 1
with 1
the 1
anxiety 1
all 1
swept 1
from 1
her 1
face 1
I 1
shall 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
Hampshire 1
quite 1
easy 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
now 1
I 1
shall 1
write 1
to 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
at 1
once 1
sacrifice 1
my 1
poor 1
hair 1
to 1
night 1
and 1
start 1
for 1
Winchester 1
to 1
morrow 1
With 1
a 1
few 1
grateful 1
words 1
to 1
Holmes 1
she 1
bade 1
us 1
both 1
good 1
night 1
and 1
bustled 1
off 1
upon 1
her 1
way 1
At 1
least 1
said 1
I 1
as 1
we 1
heard 1
her 1
quick 1
firm 1
steps 1
descending 1
the 1
stairs 1
she 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
who 1
is 1
very 1
well 1
able 1
to 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
herself 1
And 1
she 1
would 1
need 1
to 1
be 1
said 1
Holmes 1
gravely 1
I 1
am 1
much 1
mistaken 1
if 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
hear 1
from 1
her 1
before 1
many 1
days 1
are 1
past 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
very 1
long 1
before 1
my 1
friend 1
s 1
prediction 1
was 1
fulfilled 1
A 1
fortnight 1
went 1
by 1
during 1
which 1
I 1
frequently 1
found 1
my 1
thoughts 1
turning 1
in 1
her 1
direction 1
and 1
wondering 1
what 1
strange 1
side 1
alley 1
of 1
human 1
experience 1
this 1
lonely 1
woman 1
had 1
strayed 1
into 1
The 1
unusual 1
salary 1
the 1
curious 1
conditions 1
the 1
light 1
duties 1
all 1
pointed 1
to 1
something 1
abnormal 1
though 1
whether 1
a 1
fad 1
or 1
a 1
plot 1
or 1
whether 1
the 1
man 1
were 1
a 1
philanthropist 1
or 1
a 1
villain 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
beyond 1
my 1
powers 1
to 1
determine 1
As 1
to 1
Holmes 1
I 1
observed 1
that 1
he 1
sat 1
frequently 1
for 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
on 1
end 1
with 1
knitted 1
brows 1
and 1
an 1
abstracted 1
air 1
but 1
he 1
swept 1
the 1
matter 1
away 1
with 1
a 1
wave 1
of 1
his 1
hand 1
when 1
I 1
mentioned 1
it 1
Data 1
data 2
he 1
cried 1
impatiently 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
make 1
bricks 1
without 1
clay 1
And 1
yet 1
he 1
would 1
always 1
wind 1
up 1
by 1
muttering 1
that 1
no 1
sister 1
of 1
his 1
should 1
ever 1
have 1
accepted 1
such 1
a 1
situation 1
The 1
telegram 1
which 1
we 1
eventually 1
received 1
came 1
late 1
one 1
night 1
just 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
thinking 1
of 1
turning 1
in 1
and 1
Holmes 1
was 1
settling 1
down 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
all 1
night 1
chemical 1
researches 1
which 1
he 1
frequently 1
indulged 1
in 1
when 1
I 1
would 1
leave 1
him 1
stooping 1
over 1
a 1
retort 1
and 1
a 1
test 1
tube 1
at 1
night 1
and 1
find 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
position 1
when 1
I 1
came 1
down 1
to 1
breakfast 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
He 1
opened 1
the 1
yellow 1
envelope 1
and 1
then 1
glancing 1
at 1
the 1
message 1
threw 1
it 1
across 1
to 1
me 1
Just 1
look 1
up 1
the 1
trains 1
in 1
Bradshaw 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
turned 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
chemical 1
studies 1
The 1
summons 1
was 1
a 1
brief 1
and 1
urgent 1
one 1
Please 1
be 1
at 1
the 1
Black 1
Swan 1
Hotel 1
at 1
Winchester 1
at 1
midday 1
to 1
morrow 1
it 1
said 1
Do 1
come 1
I 1
am 1
at 1
my 1
wit 1
s 1
end 1
HUNTER 1
Will 1
you 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
asked 1
Holmes 1
glancing 1
up 1
I 1
should 1
wish 1
to 1
Just 1
look 1
it 1
up 1
then 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
train 1
at 1
half 1
past 1
nine 1
said 1
I 1
glancing 1
over 1
my 1
Bradshaw 1
It 1
is 1
due 1
at 1
Winchester 1
at 1
That 1
will 1
do 1
very 1
nicely 1
Then 1
perhaps 1
I 1
had 1
better 1
postpone 1
my 1
analysis 1
of 1
the 1
acetones 1
as 1
we 1
may 1
need 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
our 1
best 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
By 1
eleven 1
o 1
clock 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
we 1
were 1
well 1
upon 1
our 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
English 1
capital 1
Holmes 1
had 1
been 1
buried 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
papers 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
down 1
but 1
after 1
we 1
had 1
passed 1
the 1
Hampshire 1
border 1
he 1
threw 1
them 1
down 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
admire 1
the 1
scenery 1
It 1
was 1
an 1
ideal 1
spring 1
day 1
a 1
light 1
blue 1
sky 1
flecked 1
with 1
little 1
fleecy 1
white 1
clouds 1
drifting 1
across 1
from 1
west 1
to 1
east 1
The 1
sun 1
was 1
shining 1
very 1
brightly 1
and 1
yet 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
exhilarating 1
nip 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
which 1
set 1
an 1
edge 1
to 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
energy 1
All 1
over 1
the 1
countryside 1
away 1
to 1
the 1
rolling 1
hills 1
around 1
Aldershot 1
the 1
little 1
red 1
and 1
grey 1
roofs 1
of 1
the 1
farm 1
steadings 1
peeped 1
out 1
from 1
amid 1
the 1
light 1
green 1
of 1
the 1
new 1
foliage 1
Are 1
they 1
not 1
fresh 1
and 1
beautiful 1
I 1
cried 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
enthusiasm 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
fresh 1
from 1
the 1
fogs 1
of 1
Baker 1
Street 1
But 1
Holmes 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
gravely 1
Do 1
you 1
know 1
Watson 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
curses 1
of 1
a 1
mind 1
with 1
a 1
turn 1
like 1
mine 1
that 1
I 1
must 1
look 1
at 1
everything 1
with 1
reference 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
special 1
subject 1
You 1
look 1
at 1
these 1
scattered 1
houses 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
impressed 1
by 1
their 1
beauty 1
I 1
look 1
at 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
only 1
thought 1
which 1
comes 1
to 1
me 1
is 1
a 1
feeling 1
of 1
their 1
isolation 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
impunity 1
with 1
which 1
crime 1
may 1
be 1
committed 1
there 1
Good 1
heavens 1
I 1
cried 1
Who 1
would 1
associate 1
crime 1
with 1
these 1
dear 1
old 1
homesteads 1
They 1
always 1
fill 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
certain 1
horror 1
It 1
is 1
my 1
belief 1
Watson 1
founded 1
upon 1
my 1
experience 1
that 1
the 1
lowest 1
and 1
vilest 1
alleys 1
in 1
London 1
do 1
not 1
present 1
a 1
more 1
dreadful 1
record 1
of 1
sin 1
than 1
does 1
the 1
smiling 1
and 1
beautiful 1
countryside 1
You 1
horrify 1
me 1
But 1
the 1
reason 1
is 1
very 1
obvious 1
The 1
pressure 1
of 1
public 1
opinion 1
can 1
do 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
what 1
the 1
law 1
cannot 1
accomplish 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
lane 1
so 1
vile 1
that 1
the 1
scream 1
of 1
a 1
tortured 1
child 1
or 1
the 1
thud 1
of 1
a 1
drunkard 1
s 1
blow 1
does 1
not 1
beget 1
sympathy 1
and 1
indignation 1
among 1
the 1
neighbours 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
whole 1
machinery 1
of 1
justice 1
is 1
ever 1
so 1
close 1
that 1
a 1
word 1
of 1
complaint 1
can 1
set 1
it 1
going 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
but 1
a 1
step 1
between 1
the 1
crime 1
and 1
the 1
dock 1
But 1
look 1
at 1
these 1
lonely 1
houses 1
each 1
in 1
its 1
own 1
fields 1
filled 1
for 1
the 1
most 1
part 1
with 1
poor 1
ignorant 1
folk 1
who 1
know 1
little 1
of 1
the 1
law 1
Think 1
of 1
the 1
deeds 1
of 1
hellish 1
cruelty 1
the 1
hidden 1
wickedness 1
which 1
may 1
go 1
on 1
year 1
in 1
year 1
out 1
in 1
such 1
places 1
and 1
none 1
the 1
wiser 1
Had 1
this 1
lady 1
who 1
appeals 1
to 1
us 1
for 1
help 1
gone 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
Winchester 1
I 1
should 1
never 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
fear 1
for 1
her 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
five 1
miles 1
of 1
country 1
which 1
makes 1
the 1
danger 1
Still 1
it 1
is 1
clear 1
that 1
she 1
is 1
not 1
personally 1
threatened 1
No 1
If 1
she 1
can 1
come 1
to 1
Winchester 1
to 1
meet 1
us 1
she 1
can 1
get 1
away 1
Quite 1
so 1
She 1
has 1
her 1
freedom 1
What 1
CAN 1
be 1
the 1
matter 1
then 1
Can 1
you 1
suggest 1
no 1
explanation 1
I 1
have 1
devised 1
seven 1
separate 1
explanations 1
each 1
of 1
which 1
would 1
cover 1
the 1
facts 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
we 1
know 1
them 1
But 1
which 1
of 1
these 1
is 1
correct 1
can 1
only 1
be 1
determined 1
by 1
the 1
fresh 1
information 1
which 1
we 1
shall 1
no 1
doubt 1
find 1
waiting 1
for 1
us 1
Well 1
there 1
is 1
the 1
tower 1
of 1
the 1
cathedral 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
soon 1
learn 1
all 1
that 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
has 1
to 1
tell 1
The 1
Black 1
Swan 1
is 1
an 1
inn 1
of 1
repute 1
in 1
the 1
High 1
Street 1
at 1
no 1
distance 1
from 1
the 1
station 1
and 1
there 1
we 1
found 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
waiting 1
for 1
us 1
She 1
had 1
engaged 1
a 1
sitting 1
room 1
and 1
our 1
lunch 1
awaited 1
us 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
delighted 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
come 1
she 1
said 1
earnestly 1
It 1
is 1
so 1
very 1
kind 1
of 1
you 1
both 1
but 1
indeed 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
should 1
do 1
Your 1
advice 1
will 1
be 1
altogether 1
invaluable 1
to 1
me 1
Pray 1
tell 1
us 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
to 1
you 1
I 1
will 1
do 1
so 1
and 1
I 1
must 1
be 1
quick 1
for 1
I 1
have 1
promised 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
to 1
be 1
back 1
before 1
three 1
I 1
got 1
his 1
leave 1
to 1
come 1
into 1
town 1
this 1
morning 1
though 1
he 1
little 1
knew 1
for 1
what 1
purpose 1
Let 1
us 1
have 1
everything 1
in 1
its 1
due 1
order 1
Holmes 1
thrust 1
his 1
long 1
thin 1
legs 1
out 1
towards 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
composed 1
himself 1
to 1
listen 1
In 1
the 1
first 1
place 1
I 1
may 1
say 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
met 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
with 1
no 1
actual 1
ill 1
treatment 1
from 1
Mr 1
and 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
It 1
is 1
only 1
fair 1
to 1
them 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
But 1
I 1
cannot 1
understand 1
them 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
easy 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
about 1
them 1
What 1
can 1
you 1
not 1
understand 1
Their 1
reasons 1
for 1
their 1
conduct 1
But 1
you 1
shall 1
have 1
it 1
all 1
just 1
as 1
it 1
occurred 1
When 1
I 1
came 1
down 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
met 1
me 1
here 1
and 1
drove 1
me 1
in 1
his 1
dog 1
cart 1
to 1
the 1
Copper 1
Beeches 1
It 1
is 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
beautifully 1
situated 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
beautiful 1
in 1
itself 1
for 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
large 1
square 1
block 1
of 1
a 1
house 1
whitewashed 1
but 1
all 1
stained 1
and 1
streaked 1
with 1
damp 1
and 1
bad 1
weather 1
There 1
are 1
grounds 1
round 1
it 1
woods 1
on 1
three 1
sides 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
fourth 1
a 1
field 1
which 1
slopes 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
Southampton 1
highroad 1
which 1
curves 1
past 1
about 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
from 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
This 1
ground 1
in 1
front 1
belongs 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
but 1
the 1
woods 1
all 1
round 1
are 1
part 1
of 1
Lord 1
Southerton 1
s 1
preserves 1
A 1
clump 1
of 1
copper 1
beeches 1
immediately 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
door 1
has 1
given 1
its 1
name 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
I 1
was 1
driven 1
over 1
by 1
my 1
employer 1
who 1
was 1
as 1
amiable 1
as 1
ever 1
and 1
was 1
introduced 1
by 1
him 1
that 1
evening 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
the 1
child 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
truth 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
in 1
the 1
conjecture 1
which 1
seemed 1
to 1
us 1
to 1
be 1
probable 1
in 1
your 1
rooms 1
at 1
Baker 1
Street 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
is 1
not 1
mad 1
I 1
found 1
her 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
silent 1
pale 1
faced 1
woman 1
much 1
younger 1
than 1
her 1
husband 1
not 1
more 1
than 1
thirty 1
I 1
should 1
think 1
while 1
he 1
can 1
hardly 1
be 1
less 1
than 1
forty 1
five 1
From 1
their 1
conversation 1
I 1
have 1
gathered 1
that 1
they 1
have 1
been 1
married 1
about 1
seven 1
years 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
widower 1
and 1
that 1
his 1
only 1
child 1
by 1
the 1
first 1
wife 1
was 1
the 1
daughter 1
who 1
has 1
gone 1
to 1
Philadelphia 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
told 1
me 1
in 1
private 1
that 1
the 1
reason 1
why 1
she 1
had 1
left 1
them 1
was 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
an 1
unreasoning 1
aversion 1
to 1
her 1
stepmother 1
As 1
the 1
daughter 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
less 1
than 1
twenty 1
I 1
can 1
quite 1
imagine 1
that 1
her 1
position 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
uncomfortable 1
with 1
her 1
father 1
s 1
young 1
wife 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
colourless 1
in 1
mind 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
in 1
feature 1
She 1
impressed 1
me 1
neither 1
favourably 1
nor 1
the 1
reverse 1
She 1
was 1
a 1
nonentity 1
It 1
was 1
easy 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
passionately 1
devoted 1
both 1
to 1
her 1
husband 1
and 1
to 1
her 1
little 1
son 1
Her 1
light 1
grey 1
eyes 1
wandered 1
continually 1
from 1
one 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
noting 1
every 1
little 1
want 1
and 1
forestalling 1
it 1
if 1
possible 1
He 1
was 1
kind 1
to 1
her 1
also 1
in 1
his 1
bluff 1
boisterous 1
fashion 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
happy 1
couple 1
And 1
yet 1
she 1
had 1
some 1
secret 1
sorrow 1
this 1
woman 1
She 1
would 1
often 1
be 1
lost 1
in 1
deep 1
thought 1
with 1
the 1
saddest 1
look 1
upon 1
her 1
face 1
More 1
than 1
once 1
I 1
have 1
surprised 1
her 1
in 1
tears 1
I 1
have 1
thought 1
sometimes 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
disposition 1
of 1
her 1
child 1
which 1
weighed 1
upon 1
her 1
mind 1
for 1
I 1
have 1
never 1
met 1
so 1
utterly 1
spoiled 1
and 1
so 1
ill 1
natured 1
a 1
little 1
creature 1
He 1
is 1
small 1
for 1
his 1
age 1
with 1
a 1
head 1
which 1
is 1
quite 1
disproportionately 1
large 1
His 1
whole 1
life 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
spent 1
in 1
an 1
alternation 1
between 1
savage 1
fits 1
of 1
passion 1
and 1
gloomy 1
intervals 1
of 1
sulking 1
Giving 1
pain 1
to 1
any 1
creature 1
weaker 1
than 1
himself 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
his 1
one 1
idea 1
of 1
amusement 1
and 1
he 1
shows 1
quite 1
remarkable 1
talent 1
in 1
planning 1
the 1
capture 1
of 1
mice 1
little 1
birds 1
and 1
insects 1
But 1
I 1
would 1
rather 1
not 1
talk 1
about 1
the 1
creature 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
and 1
indeed 1
he 1
has 1
little 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
my 1
story 1
I 1
am 1
glad 1
of 1
all 1
details 1
remarked 1
my 1
friend 1
whether 1
they 1
seem 1
to 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
relevant 1
or 1
not 1
I 1
shall 1
try 1
not 1
to 1
miss 1
anything 1
of 1
importance 1
The 1
one 1
unpleasant 1
thing 1
about 1
the 1
house 1
which 1
struck 1
me 1
at 1
once 1
was 1
the 1
appearance 1
and 1
conduct 1
of 1
the 1
servants 1
There 1
are 1
only 1
two 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
Toller 1
for 1
that 1
is 1
his 1
name 1
is 1
a 1
rough 1
uncouth 1
man 1
with 1
grizzled 1
hair 1
and 1
whiskers 1
and 1
a 1
perpetual 1
smell 1
of 1
drink 1
Twice 1
since 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
with 1
them 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
quite 1
drunk 1
and 1
yet 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
seemed 1
to 1
take 1
no 1
notice 1
of 1
it 1
His 1
wife 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
tall 1
and 1
strong 1
woman 1
with 1
a 1
sour 1
face 1
as 1
silent 1
as 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
and 1
much 1
less 1
amiable 1
They 1
are 1
a 1
most 1
unpleasant 1
couple 1
but 1
fortunately 1
I 1
spend 1
most 1
of 1
my 1
time 1
in 1
the 1
nursery 1
and 1
my 1
own 1
room 1
which 1
are 1
next 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
in 1
one 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
building 1
For 1
two 1
days 1
after 1
my 1
arrival 1
at 1
the 1
Copper 1
Beeches 1
my 1
life 1
was 1
very 1
quiet 1
on 1
the 1
third 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
came 1
down 1
just 1
after 1
breakfast 1
and 1
whispered 1
something 1
to 1
her 1
husband 1
Oh 1
yes 1
said 1
he 1
turning 1
to 1
me 1
we 1
are 1
very 1
much 1
obliged 1
to 1
you 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
for 1
falling 1
in 1
with 1
our 1
whims 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
to 1
cut 1
your 1
hair 1
I 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
it 1
has 1
not 1
detracted 1
in 1
the 1
tiniest 1
iota 1
from 1
your 1
appearance 1
We 1
shall 1
now 1
see 1
how 1
the 1
electric 1
blue 1
dress 1
will 1
become 1
you 1
You 1
will 1
find 1
it 1
laid 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
bed 1
in 1
your 1
room 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
would 1
be 1
so 1
good 1
as 1
to 1
put 1
it 1
on 1
we 1
should 1
both 1
be 1
extremely 1
obliged 1
The 1
dress 1
which 1
I 1
found 1
waiting 1
for 1
me 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
peculiar 1
shade 1
of 1
blue 1
It 1
was 1
of 1
excellent 1
material 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
beige 1
but 1
it 1
bore 1
unmistakable 1
signs 1
of 1
having 1
been 1
worn 1
before 1
It 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
better 1
fit 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
measured 1
for 1
it 1
Both 1
Mr 1
and 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
expressed 1
a 1
delight 1
at 1
the 1
look 1
of 1
it 1
which 1
seemed 1
quite 1
exaggerated 1
in 1
its 1
vehemence 1
They 1
were 1
waiting 1
for 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
drawing 1
room 1
which 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
large 1
room 1
stretching 1
along 1
the 1
entire 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
with 1
three 1
long 1
windows 1
reaching 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
floor 1
A 1
chair 1
had 1
been 1
placed 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
central 1
window 1
with 1
its 1
back 1
turned 1
towards 1
it 1
In 1
this 1
I 1
was 1
asked 1
to 1
sit 1
and 1
then 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
walking 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
began 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
a 1
series 1
of 1
the 1
funniest 1
stories 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
listened 1
to 1
You 1
cannot 1
imagine 1
how 1
comical 1
he 1
was 1
and 1
I 1
laughed 1
until 1
I 1
was 1
quite 1
weary 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
however 1
who 1
has 1
evidently 1
no 1
sense 1
of 1
humour 1
never 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
smiled 1
but 1
sat 1
with 1
her 1
hands 1
in 1
her 1
lap 1
and 1
a 1
sad 1
anxious 1
look 1
upon 1
her 1
face 1
After 1
an 1
hour 1
or 1
so 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
suddenly 1
remarked 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
time 1
to 1
commence 1
the 1
duties 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
change 1
my 1
dress 1
and 1
go 1
to 1
little 1
Edward 1
in 1
the 1
nursery 1
Two 1
days 1
later 1
this 1
same 1
performance 1
was 1
gone 1
through 1
under 1
exactly 1
similar 1
circumstances 1
Again 1
I 1
changed 1
my 1
dress 1
again 1
I 1
sat 1
in 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
again 1
I 1
laughed 1
very 1
heartily 1
at 1
the 1
funny 1
stories 1
of 1
which 1
my 1
employer 1
had 1
an 1
immense 1
repertoire 1
and 1
which 1
he 1
told 1
inimitably 1
Then 1
he 1
handed 1
me 1
a 1
yellow 1
backed 1
novel 1
and 1
moving 1
my 1
chair 1
a 1
little 1
sideways 1
that 1
my 1
own 1
shadow 1
might 1
not 1
fall 1
upon 1
the 1
page 1
he 1
begged 1
me 1
to 1
read 1
aloud 1
to 1
him 1
I 1
read 1
for 1
about 1
ten 1
minutes 1
beginning 1
in 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
a 1
chapter 1
and 1
then 1
suddenly 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
a 1
sentence 1
he 1
ordered 1
me 1
to 1
cease 1
and 1
to 1
change 1
my 1
dress 1
You 1
can 1
easily 1
imagine 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
how 1
curious 1
I 1
became 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
this 1
extraordinary 1
performance 1
could 1
possibly 1
be 1
They 1
were 1
always 1
very 1
careful 1
I 1
observed 1
to 1
turn 1
my 1
face 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
window 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
became 1
consumed 1
with 1
the 1
desire 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
behind 1
my 1
back 1
At 1
first 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
impossible 1
but 1
I 1
soon 1
devised 1
a 1
means 1
My 1
hand 1
mirror 1
had 1
been 1
broken 1
so 1
a 1
happy 1
thought 1
seized 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
concealed 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
the 1
glass 1
in 1
my 1
handkerchief 1
On 1
the 1
next 1
occasion 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
my 1
laughter 1
I 1
put 1
my 1
handkerchief 1
up 1
to 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
was 1
able 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
management 1
to 1
see 1
all 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
behind 1
me 1
I 1
confess 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
disappointed 1
There 1
was 1
nothing 1
At 1
least 1
that 1
was 1
my 1
first 1
impression 1
At 1
the 1
second 1
glance 1
however 1
I 1
perceived 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
man 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
Southampton 1
Road 1
a 1
small 1
bearded 1
man 1
in 1
a 1
grey 1
suit 1
who 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
looking 1
in 1
my 1
direction 1
The 1
road 1
is 1
an 1
important 1
highway 1
and 1
there 1
are 1
usually 1
people 1
there 1
This 1
man 1
however 1
was 1
leaning 1
against 1
the 1
railings 1
which 1
bordered 1
our 1
field 1
and 1
was 1
looking 1
earnestly 1
up 1
I 1
lowered 1
my 1
handkerchief 1
and 1
glanced 1
at 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
to 1
find 1
her 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
upon 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
most 1
searching 1
gaze 1
She 1
said 1
nothing 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
convinced 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
divined 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
mirror 1
in 1
my 1
hand 1
and 1
had 1
seen 1
what 1
was 1
behind 1
me 1
She 1
rose 1
at 1
once 1
Jephro 1
said 1
she 1
there 1
is 1
an 1
impertinent 1
fellow 1
upon 1
the 1
road 1
there 1
who 1
stares 1
up 1
at 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
No 1
friend 1
of 1
yours 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
he 1
asked 1
No 1
I 1
know 1
no 1
one 1
in 1
these 1
parts 1
Dear 1
me 1
How 1
very 1
impertinent 1
Kindly 1
turn 1
round 1
and 1
motion 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
go 1
away 1
Surely 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
better 1
to 1
take 1
no 1
notice 1
No 1
no 1
we 1
should 1
have 1
him 1
loitering 1
here 1
always 1
Kindly 1
turn 1
round 1
and 1
wave 1
him 1
away 1
like 1
that 1
I 1
did 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
told 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
instant 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
drew 1
down 1
the 1
blind 1
That 1
was 1
a 1
week 1
ago 1
and 1
from 1
that 1
time 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
sat 1
again 1
in 1
the 1
window 1
nor 1
have 1
I 1
worn 1
the 1
blue 1
dress 1
nor 1
seen 1
the 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
road 1
Pray 1
continue 1
said 1
Holmes 1
Your 1
narrative 1
promises 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
most 1
interesting 1
one 1
You 1
will 1
find 1
it 1
rather 1
disconnected 1
I 1
fear 1
and 1
there 1
may 1
prove 1
to 1
be 1
little 1
relation 1
between 1
the 1
different 1
incidents 1
of 1
which 1
I 1
speak 1
On 1
the 1
very 1
first 1
day 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
Copper 1
Beeches 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
took 1
me 1
to 1
a 1
small 1
outhouse 1
which 1
stands 1
near 1
the 1
kitchen 1
door 1
As 1
we 1
approached 1
it 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
sharp 1
rattling 1
of 1
a 1
chain 1
and 1
the 1
sound 1
as 1
of 1
a 1
large 1
animal 1
moving 1
about 1
Look 1
in 1
here 1
said 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
showing 1
me 1
a 1
slit 1
between 1
two 1
planks 1
Is 1
he 1
not 1
a 1
beauty 1
I 1
looked 1
through 1
and 1
was 1
conscious 1
of 1
two 1
glowing 1
eyes 1
and 1
of 1
a 1
vague 1
figure 1
huddled 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
Don 1
t 1
be 1
frightened 1
said 1
my 1
employer 1
laughing 1
at 1
the 1
start 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
given 1
It 1
s 1
only 1
Carlo 1
my 1
mastiff 1
I 1
call 1
him 1
mine 1
but 1
really 1
old 1
Toller 1
my 1
groom 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
man 1
who 1
can 1
do 1
anything 1
with 1
him 1
We 1
feed 1
him 1
once 1
a 1
day 1
and 1
not 1
too 1
much 1
then 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
always 1
as 1
keen 1
as 1
mustard 1
Toller 1
lets 1
him 1
loose 1
every 1
night 1
and 1
God 1
help 1
the 1
trespasser 1
whom 1
he 1
lays 1
his 1
fangs 1
upon 1
For 1
goodness 1
sake 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
ever 1
on 1
any 1
pretext 1
set 1
your 1
foot 1
over 1
the 1
threshold 1
at 1
night 1
for 1
it 1
s 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
your 1
life 1
is 1
worth 1
The 1
warning 1
was 1
no 1
idle 1
one 1
for 1
two 1
nights 1
later 1
I 1
happened 1
to 1
look 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
bedroom 1
window 1
about 1
two 1
o 1
clock 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
beautiful 1
moonlight 1
night 1
and 1
the 1
lawn 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
was 1
silvered 1
over 1
and 1
almost 1
as 1
bright 1
as 1
day 1
I 1
was 1
standing 1
rapt 1
in 1
the 1
peaceful 1
beauty 1
of 1
the 1
scene 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
aware 1
that 1
something 1
was 1
moving 1
under 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
the 1
copper 1
beeches 1
As 1
it 1
emerged 1
into 1
the 1
moonshine 1
I 1
saw 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
giant 1
dog 1
as 1
large 1
as 1
a 1
calf 1
tawny 1
tinted 1
with 1
hanging 1
jowl 1
black 1
muzzle 1
and 1
huge 1
projecting 1
bones 1
It 1
walked 1
slowly 1
across 1
the 1
lawn 1
and 1
vanished 1
into 1
the 1
shadow 1
upon 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
That 1
dreadful 1
sentinel 1
sent 1
a 1
chill 1
to 1
my 1
heart 1
which 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
any 1
burglar 1
could 1
have 1
done 1
And 1
now 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
very 1
strange 1
experience 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
I 1
had 1
as 1
you 1
know 1
cut 1
off 1
my 1
hair 1
in 1
London 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
placed 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
great 1
coil 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
my 1
trunk 1
One 1
evening 1
after 1
the 1
child 1
was 1
in 1
bed 1
I 1
began 1
to 1
amuse 1
myself 1
by 1
examining 1
the 1
furniture 1
of 1
my 1
room 1
and 1
by 1
rearranging 1
my 1
own 1
little 1
things 1
There 1
was 1
an 1
old 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
the 1
two 1
upper 1
ones 1
empty 1
and 1
open 1
the 1
lower 1
one 1
locked 1
I 1
had 1
filled 1
the 1
first 1
two 1
with 1
my 1
linen 1
and 1
as 1
I 1
had 1
still 1
much 1
to 1
pack 1
away 1
I 1
was 1
naturally 1
annoyed 1
at 1
not 1
having 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
third 1
drawer 1
It 1
struck 1
me 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
fastened 1
by 1
a 1
mere 1
oversight 1
so 1
I 1
took 1
out 1
my 1
bunch 1
of 1
keys 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
open 1
it 1
The 1
very 1
first 1
key 1
fitted 1
to 1
perfection 1
and 1
I 1
drew 1
the 1
drawer 1
open 1
There 1
was 1
only 1
one 1
thing 1
in 1
it 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
never 1
guess 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
It 1
was 1
my 1
coil 1
of 1
hair 1
I 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
examined 1
it 1
It 1
was 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
peculiar 1
tint 1
and 1
the 1
same 1
thickness 1
But 1
then 1
the 1
impossibility 1
of 1
the 1
thing 1
obtruded 1
itself 1
upon 1
me 1
How 1
could 1
my 1
hair 1
have 1
been 1
locked 1
in 1
the 1
drawer 1
With 1
trembling 1
hands 1
I 1
undid 1
my 1
trunk 1
turned 1
out 1
the 1
contents 1
and 1
drew 1
from 1
the 1
bottom 1
my 1
own 1
hair 1
I 1
laid 1
the 1
two 1
tresses 1
together 1
and 1
I 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
identical 1
Was 1
it 1
not 1
extraordinary 1
Puzzle 1
as 1
I 1
would 1
I 1
could 1
make 1
nothing 1
at 1
all 1
of 1
what 1
it 1
meant 1
I 1
returned 1
the 1
strange 1
hair 1
to 1
the 1
drawer 1
and 1
I 1
said 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
to 1
the 1
Rucastles 1
as 1
I 1
felt 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
put 1
myself 1
in 1
the 1
wrong 1
by 1
opening 1
a 1
drawer 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
locked 1
I 1
am 1
naturally 1
observant 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
remarked 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
and 1
I 1
soon 1
had 1
a 1
pretty 1
good 1
plan 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
house 1
in 1
my 1
head 1
There 1
was 1
one 1
wing 1
however 1
which 1
appeared 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
inhabited 1
at 1
all 1
A 1
door 1
which 1
faced 1
that 1
which 1
led 1
into 1
the 1
quarters 1
of 1
the 1
Tollers 1
opened 1
into 1
this 1
suite 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
invariably 1
locked 1
One 1
day 1
however 1
as 1
I 1
ascended 1
the 1
stair 1
I 1
met 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
coming 1
out 1
through 1
this 1
door 1
his 1
keys 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
a 1
look 1
on 1
his 1
face 1
which 1
made 1
him 1
a 1
very 1
different 1
person 1
to 1
the 1
round 1
jovial 1
man 1
to 1
whom 1
I 1
was 1
accustomed 1
His 1
cheeks 1
were 1
red 1
his 1
brow 1
was 1
all 1
crinkled 1
with 1
anger 1
and 1
the 1
veins 1
stood 1
out 1
at 1
his 1
temples 1
with 1
passion 1
He 1
locked 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
hurried 1
past 1
me 1
without 1
a 1
word 1
or 1
a 1
look 1
This 1
aroused 1
my 1
curiosity 1
so 1
when 1
I 1
went 1
out 1
for 1
a 1
walk 1
in 1
the 1
grounds 1
with 1
my 1
charge 1
I 1
strolled 1
round 1
to 1
the 1
side 1
from 1
which 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
windows 1
of 1
this 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
There 1
were 1
four 1
of 1
them 1
in 1
a 1
row 1
three 1
of 1
which 1
were 1
simply 1
dirty 1
while 1
the 1
fourth 1
was 1
shuttered 1
up 1
They 1
were 1
evidently 1
all 1
deserted 1
As 1
I 1
strolled 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
glancing 1
at 1
them 1
occasionally 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
came 1
out 1
to 1
me 1
looking 1
as 1
merry 1
and 1
jovial 1
as 1
ever 1
Ah 1
said 1
he 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
think 1
me 1
rude 1
if 1
I 1
passed 1
you 1
without 1
a 1
word 1
my 1
dear 1
young 1
lady 1
I 1
was 1
preoccupied 1
with 1
business 1
matters 1
I 1
assured 1
him 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
offended 1
By 1
the 1
way 1
said 1
I 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
have 1
quite 1
a 1
suite 1
of 1
spare 1
rooms 1
up 1
there 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
has 1
the 1
shutters 1
up 1
He 1
looked 1
surprised 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
little 1
startled 1
at 1
my 1
remark 1
Photography 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
hobbies 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
have 1
made 1
my 1
dark 1
room 1
up 1
there 1
But 1
dear 1
me 1
what 1
an 1
observant 1
young 1
lady 1
we 1
have 1
come 1
upon 1
Who 1
would 1
have 1
believed 1
it 1
Who 1
would 1
have 1
ever 1
believed 1
it 1
He 1
spoke 1
in 1
a 1
jesting 1
tone 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
jest 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
at 1
me 1
I 1
read 1
suspicion 1
there 1
and 1
annoyance 1
but 1
no 1
jest 1
Well 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
from 1
the 1
moment 1
that 1
I 1
understood 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
about 1
that 1
suite 1
of 1
rooms 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
know 1
I 1
was 1
all 1
on 1
fire 1
to 1
go 1
over 1
them 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
mere 1
curiosity 1
though 1
I 1
have 1
my 1
share 1
of 1
that 1
It 1
was 1
more 1
a 1
feeling 1
of 1
duty 1
a 1
feeling 1
that 1
some 1
good 1
might 1
come 1
from 1
my 1
penetrating 1
to 1
this 1
place 1
They 1
talk 1
of 1
woman 1
s 1
instinct 1
perhaps 1
it 1
was 1
woman 1
s 1
instinct 1
which 1
gave 1
me 1
that 1
feeling 1
At 1
any 1
rate 1
it 1
was 1
there 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
keenly 1
on 1
the 1
lookout 1
for 1
any 1
chance 1
to 1
pass 1
the 1
forbidden 1
door 1
It 1
was 1
only 1
yesterday 1
that 1
the 1
chance 1
came 1
I 1
may 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
besides 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
both 1
Toller 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
find 1
something 1
to 1
do 1
in 1
these 1
deserted 1
rooms 1
and 1
I 1
once 1
saw 1
him 1
carrying 1
a 1
large 1
black 1
linen 1
bag 1
with 1
him 1
through 1
the 1
door 1
Recently 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
drinking 1
hard 1
and 1
yesterday 1
evening 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
drunk 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
came 1
upstairs 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
key 1
in 1
the 1
door 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
at 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
it 1
there 1
Mr 1
and 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
were 1
both 1
downstairs 1
and 1
the 1
child 1
was 1
with 1
them 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
an 1
admirable 1
opportunity 1
I 1
turned 1
the 1
key 1
gently 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
slipped 1
through 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
passage 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
me 1
unpapered 1
and 1
uncarpeted 1
which 1
turned 1
at 1
a 1
right 1
angle 1
at 1
the 1
farther 1
end 1
Round 1
this 1
corner 1
were 1
three 1
doors 1
in 1
a 1
line 1
the 1
first 1
and 1
third 1
of 1
which 1
were 1
open 1
They 1
each 1
led 1
into 1
an 1
empty 1
room 1
dusty 1
and 1
cheerless 1
with 1
two 1
windows 1
in 1
the 1
one 1
and 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
so 1
thick 1
with 1
dirt 1
that 1
the 1
evening 1
light 1
glimmered 1
dimly 1
through 1
them 1
The 1
centre 1
door 1
was 1
closed 1
and 1
across 1
the 1
outside 1
of 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
fastened 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
broad 1
bars 1
of 1
an 1
iron 1
bed 1
padlocked 1
at 1
one 1
end 1
to 1
a 1
ring 1
in 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
fastened 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
with 1
stout 1
cord 1
The 1
door 1
itself 1
was 1
locked 1
as 1
well 1
and 1
the 1
key 1
was 1
not 1
there 1
This 1
barricaded 1
door 1
corresponded 1
clearly 1
with 1
the 1
shuttered 1
window 1
outside 1
and 1
yet 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
by 1
the 1
glimmer 1
from 1
beneath 1
it 1
that 1
the 1
room 1
was 1
not 1
in 1
darkness 1
Evidently 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
skylight 1
which 1
let 1
in 1
light 1
from 1
above 1
As 1
I 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
passage 1
gazing 1
at 1
the 1
sinister 1
door 1
and 1
wondering 1
what 1
secret 1
it 1
might 1
veil 1
I 1
suddenly 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
steps 1
within 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
saw 1
a 1
shadow 1
pass 1
backward 1
and 1
forward 1
against 1
the 1
little 1
slit 1
of 1
dim 1
light 1
which 1
shone 1
out 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
door 1
A 1
mad 1
unreasoning 1
terror 1
rose 1
up 1
in 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
My 1
overstrung 1
nerves 1
failed 1
me 1
suddenly 1
and 1
I 1
turned 1
and 1
ran 2
as 1
though 1
some 1
dreadful 1
hand 1
were 1
behind 1
me 1
clutching 1
at 1
the 1
skirt 1
of 1
my 1
dress 1
I 1
rushed 1
down 1
the 1
passage 1
through 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
straight 1
into 1
the 1
arms 1
of 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
who 1
was 1
waiting 1
outside 1
So 1
said 1
he 1
smiling 1
it 1
was 1
you 1
then 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
when 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
door 1
open 1
Oh 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
frightened 1
I 1
panted 1
My 1
dear 1
young 1
lady 1
my 1
dear 1
young 1
lady 1
you 1
cannot 1
think 1
how 1
caressing 1
and 1
soothing 1
his 1
manner 1
was 1
and 1
what 1
has 1
frightened 1
you 1
my 1
dear 1
young 1
lady 1
But 1
his 1
voice 1
was 1
just 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
coaxing 1
He 1
overdid 1
it 1
I 1
was 1
keenly 1
on 1
my 1
guard 1
against 1
him 1
I 1
was 1
foolish 1
enough 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
empty 1
wing 1
I 1
answered 1
But 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
lonely 1
and 1
eerie 1
in 1
this 1
dim 1
light 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
frightened 1
and 1
ran 1
out 1
again 1
Oh 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
dreadfully 1
still 1
in 1
there 1
Only 1
that 1
said 1
he 1
looking 1
at 1
me 1
keenly 1
Why 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
think 1
I 1
asked 1
Why 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
lock 1
this 1
door 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
that 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
It 1
is 1
to 1
keep 1
people 1
out 1
who 1
have 1
no 1
business 1
there 1
Do 1
you 1
see 1
He 1
was 1
still 1
smiling 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
amiable 1
manner 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
known 1
Well 1
then 1
you 1
know 1
now 1
And 1
if 1
you 1
ever 1
put 1
your 1
foot 1
over 1
that 1
threshold 1
again 1
here 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
the 1
smile 1
hardened 1
into 1
a 1
grin 1
of 1
rage 1
and 1
he 1
glared 1
down 1
at 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
a 1
demon 1
I 1
ll 1
throw 1
you 1
to 1
the 1
mastiff 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
terrified 1
that 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
did 1
I 1
suppose 1
that 1
I 1
must 1
have 1
rushed 1
past 1
him 1
into 1
my 1
room 1
I 1
remember 1
nothing 1
until 1
I 1
found 1
myself 1
lying 1
on 1
my 1
bed 1
trembling 1
all 1
over 1
Then 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
you 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
live 1
there 1
longer 1
without 1
some 1
advice 1
I 1
was 1
frightened 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
of 1
the 1
woman 1
of 1
the 1
servants 1
even 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
They 1
were 1
all 1
horrible 1
to 1
me 1
If 1
I 1
could 1
only 1
bring 1
you 1
down 1
all 1
would 1
be 1
well 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
might 1
have 1
fled 1
from 1
the 1
house 1
but 1
my 1
curiosity 1
was 1
almost 1
as 1
strong 1
as 1
my 1
fears 1
My 1
mind 1
was 1
soon 1
made 1
up 1
I 1
would 1
send 1
you 1
a 1
wire 1
I 1
put 1
on 1
my 1
hat 1
and 1
cloak 1
went 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
office 1
which 1
is 1
about 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
from 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
then 1
returned 1
feeling 1
very 1
much 1
easier 1
A 1
horrible 1
doubt 1
came 1
into 1
my 1
mind 1
as 1
I 1
approached 1
the 1
door 1
lest 1
the 1
dog 1
might 1
be 1
loose 1
but 1
I 1
remembered 1
that 1
Toller 1
had 1
drunk 1
himself 1
into 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
insensibility 1
that 1
evening 1
and 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
household 1
who 1
had 1
any 1
influence 1
with 1
the 1
savage 1
creature 1
or 1
who 1
would 1
venture 1
to 1
set 1
him 1
free 1
I 1
slipped 1
in 2
safety 1
and 1
lay 1
awake 1
half 1
the 1
night 1
in 1
my 1
joy 1
at 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
seeing 1
you 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
difficulty 1
in 1
getting 1
leave 1
to 1
come 1
into 1
Winchester 1
this 1
morning 1
but 1
I 1
must 1
be 1
back 1
before 1
three 1
o 1
clock 1
for 1
Mr 1
and 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
are 1
going 1
on 1
a 1
visit 1
and 1
will 1
be 1
away 1
all 1
the 1
evening 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
must 1
look 1
after 1
the 1
child 1
Now 1
I 1
have 1
told 1
you 1
all 1
my 1
adventures 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
and 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
very 1
glad 1
if 1
you 1
could 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
it 1
all 1
means 1
and 1
above 1
all 1
what 1
I 1
should 1
do 1
Holmes 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
listened 1
spellbound 1
to 1
this 1
extraordinary 1
story 1
My 1
friend 1
rose 1
now 1
and 1
paced 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
his 1
hands 1
in 1
his 1
pockets 1
and 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
profound 1
gravity 1
upon 1
his 1
face 1
Is 1
Toller 1
still 1
drunk 1
he 1
asked 1
Yes 1
I 1
heard 1
his 1
wife 1
tell 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
do 1
nothing 1
with 1
him 1
That 1
is 1
well 1
And 1
the 1
Rucastles 1
go 1
out 1
to 1
night 1
Yes 1
Is 1
there 1
a 1
cellar 1
with 1
a 1
good 1
strong 1
lock 1
Yes 1
the 1
wine 1
cellar 1
You 1
seem 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
have 1
acted 1
all 1
through 1
this 1
matter 1
like 1
a 1
very 1
brave 1
and 1
sensible 1
girl 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
Do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
perform 1
one 1
more 1
feat 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
ask 1
it 1
of 1
you 1
if 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
think 1
you 1
a 1
quite 1
exceptional 1
woman 1
I 1
will 1
try 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
We 1
shall 1
be 1
at 1
the 1
Copper 1
Beeches 1
by 1
seven 1
o 1
clock 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
I 1
The 1
Rucastles 1
will 1
be 1
gone 1
by 1
that 1
time 1
and 1
Toller 1
will 1
we 1
hope 1
be 1
incapable 1
There 1
only 1
remains 1
Mrs 1
Toller 1
who 1
might 1
give 1
the 1
alarm 1
If 1
you 1
could 1
send 1
her 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
on 1
some 1
errand 1
and 1
then 1
turn 1
the 1
key 1
upon 1
her 1
you 1
would 1
facilitate 1
matters 1
immensely 1
I 1
will 1
do 1
it 1
Excellent 1
We 1
shall 1
then 1
look 1
thoroughly 1
into 1
the 1
affair 1
Of 1
course 1
there 1
is 1
only 1
one 1
feasible 1
explanation 1
You 1
have 1
been 1
brought 1
there 1
to 1
personate 1
someone 1
and 1
the 1
real 1
person 1
is 1
imprisoned 1
in 1
this 1
chamber 1
That 1
is 1
obvious 1
As 1
to 1
who 1
this 1
prisoner 1
is 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
daughter 1
Miss 1
Alice 1
Rucastle 1
if 1
I 1
remember 1
right 1
who 1
was 1
said 1
to 1
have 1
gone 1
to 1
America 1
You 1
were 1
chosen 1
doubtless 1
as 1
resembling 1
her 1
in 1
height 1
figure 1
and 1
the 1
colour 1
of 1
your 1
hair 1
Hers 1
had 1
been 1
cut 1
off 1
very 1
possibly 1
in 1
some 1
illness 1
through 1
which 1
she 1
has 1
passed 1
and 1
so 1
of 1
course 1
yours 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
sacrificed 1
also 1
By 1
a 1
curious 1
chance 1
you 1
came 1
upon 1
her 1
tresses 1
The 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
road 1
was 1
undoubtedly 1
some 1
friend 1
of 1
hers 1
possibly 1
her 1
fiance 1
and 1
no 1
doubt 1
as 1
you 1
wore 1
the 1
girl 1
s 1
dress 1
and 1
were 1
so 1
like 1
her 1
he 1
was 1
convinced 1
from 1
your 1
laughter 1
whenever 1
he 1
saw 1
you 1
and 1
afterwards 1
from 1
your 1
gesture 1
that 1
Miss 1
Rucastle 1
was 1
perfectly 1
happy 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
no 1
longer 1
desired 1
his 1
attentions 1
The 1
dog 1
is 1
let 1
loose 1
at 1
night 1
to 1
prevent 1
him 1
from 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
communicate 1
with 1
her 1
So 1
much 1
is 1
fairly 1
clear 1
The 1
most 1
serious 1
point 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
is 1
the 1
disposition 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
What 1
on 1
earth 1
has 1
that 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
I 1
ejaculated 1
My 1
dear 1
Watson 1
you 1
as 1
a 1
medical 1
man 1
are 1
continually 1
gaining 1
light 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
tendencies 1
of 1
a 1
child 1
by 1
the 1
study 1
of 1
the 1
parents 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
converse 1
is 1
equally 1
valid 1
I 1
have 1
frequently 1
gained 1
my 1
first 1
real 1
insight 1
into 1
the 1
character 1
of 1
parents 1
by 1
studying 1
their 1
children 1
This 1
child 1
s 1
disposition 1
is 1
abnormally 1
cruel 1
merely 1
for 1
cruelty 1
s 1
sake 1
and 1
whether 1
he 1
derives 1
this 1
from 1
his 1
smiling 1
father 1
as 1
I 1
should 1
suspect 1
or 1
from 1
his 1
mother 1
it 1
bodes 1
evil 1
for 1
the 1
poor 1
girl 1
who 1
is 1
in 1
their 1
power 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
right 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
cried 1
our 1
client 1
A 1
thousand 1
things 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
me 1
which 1
make 1
me 1
certain 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
hit 1
it 1
Oh 1
let 1
us 1
lose 1
not 1
an 1
instant 1
in 1
bringing 1
help 1
to 1
this 1
poor 1
creature 1
We 1
must 1
be 1
circumspect 1
for 1
we 1
are 1
dealing 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
cunning 1
man 1
We 1
can 1
do 1
nothing 1
until 1
seven 1
o 1
clock 1
At 1
that 1
hour 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
it 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
long 1
before 1
we 1
solve 1
the 1
mystery 1
We 1
were 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
our 1
word 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
seven 1
when 1
we 1
reached 1
the 1
Copper 1
Beeches 1
having 1
put 1
up 1
our 1
trap 1
at 1
a 1
wayside 1
public 1
house 1
The 1
group 1
of 1
trees 1
with 1
their 1
dark 1
leaves 1
shining 1
like 1
burnished 1
metal 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
setting 1
sun 1
were 1
sufficient 1
to 1
mark 1
the 1
house 1
even 1
had 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
not 1
been 1
standing 1
smiling 1
on 1
the 1
door 1
step 1
Have 1
you 1
managed 1
it 1
asked 1
Holmes 1
A 1
loud 1
thudding 1
noise 1
came 1
from 1
somewhere 1
downstairs 1
That 1
is 1
Mrs 1
Toller 1
in 1
the 1
cellar 1
said 1
she 1
Her 1
husband 1
lies 1
snoring 1
on 1
the 1
kitchen 1
rug 1
Here 1
are 1
his 1
keys 1
which 1
are 1
the 1
duplicates 1
of 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
s 1
You 1
have 1
done 1
well 1
indeed 1
cried 1
Holmes 1
with 1
enthusiasm 1
Now 1
lead 1
the 1
way 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
soon 1
see 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
this 1
black 1
business 1
We 1
passed 1
up 1
the 1
stair 1
unlocked 1
the 1
door 1
followed 1
on 1
down 1
a 1
passage 1
and 1
found 1
ourselves 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
barricade 1
which 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
had 1
described 1
Holmes 1
cut 1
the 1
cord 1
and 1
removed 1
the 1
transverse 1
bar 1
Then 1
he 1
tried 1
the 1
various 1
keys 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
but 1
without 1
success 1
No 1
sound 1
came 1
from 1
within 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
silence 1
Holmes 1
face 1
clouded 1
over 1
I 1
trust 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
too 1
late 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
think 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
better 1
go 1
in 1
without 1
you 1
Now 1
Watson 1
put 1
your 1
shoulder 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
whether 1
we 1
cannot 1
make 1
our 1
way 1
in 1
It 1
was 1
an 1
old 1
rickety 1
door 1
and 1
gave 1
at 1
once 1
before 1
our 1
united 1
strength 1
Together 1
we 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
It 1
was 1
empty 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
furniture 1
save 1
a 1
little 1
pallet 1
bed 1
a 1
small 1
table 1
and 1
a 1
basketful 1
of 1
linen 1
The 1
skylight 1
above 1
was 1
open 1
and 1
the 1
prisoner 1
gone 1
There 1
has 1
been 1
some 1
villainy 1
here 1
said 1
Holmes 1
this 1
beauty 1
has 1
guessed 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
s 1
intentions 1
and 1
has 1
carried 1
his 1
victim 1
off 1
But 1
how 1
Through 1
the 1
skylight 1
We 1
shall 1
soon 1
see 1
how 1
he 1
managed 1
it 1
He 1
swung 1
himself 1
up 1
onto 1
the 1
roof 1
Ah 1
yes 1
he 1
cried 1
here 1
s 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
a 1
long 1
light 1
ladder 1
against 1
the 1
eaves 1
That 1
is 1
how 1
he 1
did 1
it 1
But 1
it 1
is 1
impossible 1
said 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
the 1
ladder 1
was 1
not 1
there 1
when 1
the 1
Rucastles 1
went 1
away 1
He 1
has 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
done 1
it 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
clever 1
and 1
dangerous 1
man 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
very 1
much 1
surprised 1
if 1
this 1
were 1
he 1
whose 1
step 1
I 1
hear 1
now 1
upon 1
the 1
stair 1
I 1
think 1
Watson 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
as 1
well 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
have 1
your 1
pistol 1
ready 1
The 1
words 1
were 1
hardly 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
mouth 1
before 1
a 1
man 1
appeared 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
a 1
very 1
fat 1
and 1
burly 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
heavy 1
stick 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
screamed 1
and 1
shrunk 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
him 1
but 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
sprang 1
forward 1
and 1
confronted 1
him 1
You 1
villain 1
said 1
he 1
where 1
s 1
your 1
daughter 1
The 1
fat 1
man 1
cast 1
his 1
eyes 1
round 1
and 1
then 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
open 1
skylight 1
It 1
is 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
that 1
he 1
shrieked 1
you 1
thieves 1
Spies 1
and 1
thieves 1
I 1
have 1
caught 1
you 1
have 1
I 1
You 1
are 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
I 1
ll 1
serve 1
you 1
He 1
turned 1
and 1
clattered 1
down 1
the 1
stairs 1
as 1
hard 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
go 1
He 1
s 1
gone 1
for 1
the 1
dog 1
cried 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
I 1
have 1
my 1
revolver 1
said 1
I 1
Better 1
close 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
cried 1
Holmes 1
and 1
we 1
all 1
rushed 1
down 1
the 1
stairs 1
together 1
We 1
had 1
hardly 1
reached 1
the 1
hall 1
when 1
we 1
heard 1
the 1
baying 1
of 1
a 1
hound 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
scream 1
of 1
agony 1
with 1
a 1
horrible 1
worrying 1
sound 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
dreadful 1
to 1
listen 1
to 1
An 1
elderly 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
red 1
face 1
and 1
shaking 1
limbs 1
came 1
staggering 1
out 1
at 1
a 1
side 1
door 1
My 1
God 1
he 1
cried 1
Someone 1
has 1
loosed 1
the 1
dog 1
It 1
s 1
not 1
been 1
fed 1
for 1
two 1
days 1
Quick 1
quick 1
or 1
it 1
ll 1
be 1
too 1
late 1
Holmes 1
and 1
I 1
rushed 1
out 1
and 1
round 1
the 1
angle 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
with 1
Toller 1
hurrying 1
behind 1
us 1
There 1
was 1
the 1
huge 1
famished 1
brute 1
its 1
black 1
muzzle 1
buried 1
in 1
Rucastle 1
s 1
throat 1
while 1
he 1
writhed 1
and 1
screamed 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
Running 1
up 1
I 1
blew 1
its 1
brains 1
out 1
and 1
it 1
fell 1
over 1
with 1
its 1
keen 1
white 1
teeth 1
still 1
meeting 1
in 1
the 1
great 1
creases 1
of 1
his 1
neck 1
With 1
much 1
labour 1
we 1
separated 1
them 1
and 1
carried 1
him 1
living 1
but 1
horribly 1
mangled 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
We 1
laid 1
him 1
upon 1
the 1
drawing 1
room 1
sofa 1
and 1
having 1
dispatched 1
the 1
sobered 1
Toller 1
to 1
bear 1
the 1
news 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1
I 1
did 1
what 1
I 1
could 1
to 1
relieve 1
his 1
pain 1
We 1
were 1
all 1
assembled 1
round 1
him 1
when 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
a 1
tall 1
gaunt 1
woman 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
Mrs 1
Toller 1
cried 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
Yes 1
miss 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
let 1
me 1
out 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
before 1
he 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
you 1
Ah 1
miss 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
pity 1
you 1
didn 1
t 1
let 1
me 1
know 1
what 1
you 1
were 1
planning 1
for 1
I 1
would 1
have 1
told 1
you 1
that 1
your 1
pains 1
were 1
wasted 1
Ha 1
said 1
Holmes 1
looking 1
keenly 1
at 1
her 1
It 1
is 1
clear 1
that 1
Mrs 1
Toller 1
knows 1
more 1
about 1
this 1
matter 1
than 1
anyone 1
else 1
Yes 1
sir 1
I 1
do 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
ready 1
enough 1
to 1
tell 1
what 1
I 1
know 1
Then 1
pray 1
sit 1
down 1
and 1
let 1
us 1
hear 1
it 1
for 1
there 1
are 1
several 1
points 1
on 1
which 1
I 1
must 1
confess 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
still 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
I 1
will 1
soon 1
make 1
it 1
clear 1
to 1
you 1
said 1
she 1
and 1
I 1
d 1
have 1
done 1
so 1
before 1
now 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
ha 1
got 1
out 1
from 1
the 1
cellar 1
If 1
there 1
s 1
police 1
court 1
business 1
over 1
this 1
you 1
ll 1
remember 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
stood 1
your 1
friend 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
Miss 1
Alice 1
s 1
friend 1
too 1
She 1
was 1
never 1
happy 1
at 1
home 1
Miss 1
Alice 1
wasn 1
t 1
from 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
her 1
father 1
married 1
again 1
She 1
was 1
slighted 1
like 1
and 1
had 1
no 1
say 1
in 1
anything 1
but 1
it 1
never 1
really 1
became 1
bad 1
for 1
her 1
until 1
after 1
she 1
met 1
Mr 1
Fowler 1
at 1
a 1
friend 1
s 1
house 1
As 1
well 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
learn 1
Miss 1
Alice 1
had 1
rights 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
by 1
will 1
but 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
quiet 1
and 1
patient 1
she 1
was 1
that 1
she 1
never 1
said 1
a 1
word 1
about 1
them 1
but 1
just 1
left 1
everything 1
in 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
s 1
hands 1
He 1
knew 1
he 1
was 1
safe 1
with 1
her 1
but 1
when 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
chance 1
of 1
a 1
husband 1
coming 1
forward 1
who 1
would 1
ask 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
the 1
law 1
would 1
give 1
him 1
then 1
her 1
father 1
thought 1
it 1
time 1
to 1
put 1
a 1
stop 1
on 1
it 1
He 1
wanted 1
her 1
to 1
sign 1
a 1
paper 1
so 1
that 1
whether 1
she 1
married 1
or 1
not 1
he 1
could 1
use 1
her 1
money 1
When 1
she 1
wouldn 1
t 1
do 1
it 1
he 1
kept 1
on 1
worrying 1
her 1
until 1
she 1
got 1
brain 1
fever 1
and 1
for 1
six 1
weeks 1
was 1
at 1
death 1
s 1
door 1
Then 1
she 1
got 1
better 1
at 1
last 1
all 1
worn 1
to 1
a 1
shadow 1
and 1
with 1
her 1
beautiful 1
hair 1
cut 1
off 1
but 1
that 1
didn 1
t 1
make 1
no 1
change 1
in 1
her 1
young 1
man 1
and 1
he 1
stuck 1
to 1
her 1
as 1
true 1
as 1
man 1
could 1
be 1
Ah 1
said 1
Holmes 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
tell 1
us 1
makes 1
the 1
matter 1
fairly 1
clear 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
can 1
deduce 1
all 1
that 1
remains 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
then 1
I 1
presume 1
took 1
to 1
this 1
system 1
of 1
imprisonment 1
Yes 1
sir 1
And 1
brought 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
down 1
from 1
London 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
the 1
disagreeable 1
persistence 1
of 1
Mr 1
Fowler 1
That 1
was 1
it 1
sir 1
But 1
Mr 1
Fowler 1
being 1
a 1
persevering 1
man 1
as 1
a 1
good 1
seaman 1
should 1
be 1
blockaded 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
having 1
met 1
you 1
succeeded 1
by 1
certain 1
arguments 1
metallic 1
or 1
otherwise 1
in 1
convincing 1
you 1
that 1
your 1
interests 1
were 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
his 1
Mr 1
Fowler 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
kind 1
spoken 1
free 1
handed 1
gentleman 1
said 1
Mrs 1
Toller 1
serenely 1
And 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
he 1
managed 1
that 1
your 1
good 1
man 1
should 1
have 1
no 1
want 1
of 1
drink 1
and 1
that 1
a 1
ladder 1
should 1
be 1
ready 1
at 1
the 1
moment 1
when 1
your 1
master 1
had 1
gone 1
out 1
You 1
have 1
it 1
sir 1
just 1
as 1
it 1
happened 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
we 1
owe 1
you 1
an 1
apology 1
Mrs 1
Toller 1
said 1
Holmes 1
for 1
you 1
have 1
certainly 1
cleared 1
up 1
everything 1
which 1
puzzled 1
us 1
And 1
here 1
comes 1
the 1
country 1
surgeon 1
and 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
so 1
I 1
think 1
Watson 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
best 1
escort 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
back 1
to 1
Winchester 1
as 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
our 1
locus 1
standi 1
now 1
is 1
rather 1
a 1
questionable 1
one 1
And 1
thus 1
was 1
solved 1
the 1
mystery 1
of 1
the 1
sinister 1
house 1
with 1
the 1
copper 1
beeches 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
survived 1
but 1
was 1
always 1
a 1
broken 1
man 1
kept 1
alive 1
solely 1
through 1
the 1
care 1
of 1
his 1
devoted 1
wife 1

Mr 1
Fowler 1
and 1
Miss 1
Rucastle 1
were 1
married 1
by 1
special 1
license 1
in 1
Southampton 1
the 1
day 1
after 1
their 1
flight 1

he 1
is 1
now 1
the 1
holder 1
of 1
a 1

As 1

Violet 1
Hunter 1
my 1

Holmes 1
rather 1
to 1
my 1
disappointment 1
manifested 1
no 1
further 1
interest 1
in 1
her 1
when 1
once 1
she 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
problems 1
and 1
she 1
is 1
now 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
a 1
private 1
school 1
at 1
Walsall 1
where 1
I 1
believe 1
that 1
she 1
has 1
met 1
with 1
considerable 1
success 1
